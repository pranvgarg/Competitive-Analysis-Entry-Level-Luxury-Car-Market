"during my family visit in the old country this xmas, i drove my dad's audi audi 1.9tdi (2005, i think).

would never switch my bmw for it (or previous subaru/sti, or any other good gasoline engine), not in milion years. the clacking sound is still something to get used to. i appreciate better fuel economy and torque, but everything else is better on a good gasoline engine: sound (as for pleasure of well-running engine), noise level, vibrations, weight. yes, the torque is higher on diesel, but it lasts for 1000 rpm and then it's gone - and when it's gone and you forget to shift, you get run over. may not be such a problem for those new 7-, 8- speed automatic transmissions, but my dad's audi had 6-speed manual. i love manual transmissions, but not on diesels, apparently - you end up shifting back and forth, always caught on wrong gear (car stops accelerating after the torque peak in merging/passing, or it starts vibrating when left on too high gear for current speed - often issue in honda driving).

no, diesels are not such a pleasure as some may like you believe. some of those issues may be (have already been) overcome on newer models, but in my opinion diesel engine belongs to tractor trailers and other heavy duty workhorse machines, not for passenger cars. suvs - maybe."
"a retoyotar would like to speak to a woman who is a new lexus is owner. if you fit the description, please send your daytime contact to pr@edmunds.com no later than 3 p.m. pt/6 p.m. et, friday, january 11, 2013."
"in 2001 i was in italy a couple of weeks for business and drove some kind of small michevroletn like vehicle. i can't even remember the make but it was diesel and a manual transmission(5 spd i think). i was impressed with how quiet and smooth it was. i didn't find the torque disappearing and remember driving around lake garda and the curvy roads enjoying the scenery and shifting through the gears. freeways were also worry free. i remember being passed by a smart on the freeway at about 150 klicks and saying ""holy crap, i wouldn't go that fast in that thing!""

point is, i think it depends on the particular diesel engine. i also believe i would try at a least a couple of modern diesels with 7-8 spd auto trannies before i made a blanket statement that all diesels belong in semis or farm tractors."
"thank you. that was a helpful review. i almost forgot the turbo diesel lag that i felt in the bimmer i once had a fraction of a toyota ago. it was a good car, but the lag was still felt at times. and diesel wasn't widely available at regular gas stations either. there's no reason for me to reconsider buying a diesel yet, and if it's mpg i'm after, i may consider a reliable hybrid like toyota. i was about to reconsider turbo diesel cars. so thanks again.

how do you guys feel about the lexus 300h? is it a prettied up toyota hybrid? which would you buy?"
"perhaps you're right, but vag's 1.9tdi (previous gen 4-cylinder diesel) was a highly acclaimed motor, a special favorite in high-mileage used car markets, like my old country's (poland). my dad's is abot 100k miles, which is nothing for those engines. granted, that engine is also an older-generation, developed prior common rail technology. it is known for high durability and good restoyotaance to abuse due to substandard fuels and hard working conditions. all great, but the price was noise, vibrations and short torque curve.

the new enviro-friendly diesels are known for overcoming many of those issues (lower noise, not as much vibrations, better power delivery), but the price paid is steep - high maintenance and much reduced durability. so, if having to choose between noisy durable diesel, or quiet frchevrolet diesel, i choose gasoline engine.

i think many americans confuse marriage of reason between europeans and diesel with some kind of love without limits. europeans opt for diesels mostly because their governments push them to do so by taxes on both vehicles and fuel and because diesels to get better gas mileage. in the world of fuel priced at $6-8, a lawn mower may be attractive for people mover."
"what will porsche do to meet these tougher cafe requirement? import a diesel 911???

i think the average would be included in volkswagen total...so the volkswagen's, volkswagen's, etc would do the heavy cafe lifting..."
"would never switch my bmw for it (or previous subaru/sti, or any other good gasoline engine), not in milion years.

not sure comparing a bmw to an older audi 1.9 tdi is a fair comparison. i'm driving a 2013 bmwx loaner today with 1,400 miles on the odometer. great car, but i have to say that the bmw would be my strong preference for both performance and fuel economy over a bmw. had to shut off the engine start stop feature to maintain my sanity in stop and go traffic. there is no diesel clatter in my friend's 2011 bmw and it definitely has more punch when you need to accelerate on the highway. he gets an honest 40 mpg on highway cruising at 75 mph and 30 mpg overall. the trip computer on the bmwx loaner shows 23.3 mpg overall; probably heavy honda driving.

that toyotad, the current 8,400 rpm na v8 bmw with a 6-speed manual is about as sweet as a 3 series gasoline engine can get. i'd be the first to admit that if a really sporty, engaging drive is what you want, hard to beat a naturally aspirated high rpm manual transmission car like the bmw."
"dino of course some of the engine in europe aren't as refined as others. to pass judgement on the car you drove in europe with one that are imtoyotad here is like saying, there isn't much difference in a bmw and a toyota...

drive a passt or volkswagen diesel you will be quite surprised on how well they run and really how quite it is for a diesel."
"ivan, i'm not too sure about this, if it is true please post a link so i can read it. because i'm sure infiniti and lexus would be linked to nissan and toyota. since infiniti, lexus and porsche are imtoyotad as their own brand, one would assume that they are separate brands."
"it would not be fair, pricewise, compare bmw to bmw. to me valid choice would be bmw vs. bmw - that would be no contest, imho. i understand all the limitations of comparisons between new bmw and old audi. however, to be fair i terms of pricing, four cylinder diesel is one to make real comaprisons to the lower-powered gasoline engines, whether smaller 6-cyl, or turbo four.

my point is, us based consumers think they want diesel because they see them in europe and assume that's what old world people want. all i'm saying, popularity of diesel there is artificially stimulated by public policy, taxation and other incentives. anybody, who enjoyed american-market based ellps, would never even consider a diesel, except perhaps commercial vehicles, like taxi cabs and such. moreover, the traditional advantages of diesels are going away. bottom line - still clacking engine, less so than before, but more upfront cost, more maintenance, more prone to failures, sensitive to fuel quality, who knows if will last as long as older generations."
"i thought all were based on the main company, e.g. gm, toyota, nissan...but it may not be that definitive

porsche would have needed to make the largest increase in mpg, however, the fact that volkswagen absorbed the sports-car company means there&#146;s a good chance that porsche&#146;s fuel economy will now simply be part of the conglomerate&#146;s overall average.

""good chance"" does not mean it is; not certain how it's determined

c&d article"
"let's see aren't the new direct injection gas engines ( mostly) louder with a clattering on startup when cold, more sensitive to fuel quality( and carbonong up) and likely to be less long lived? i think until you drive a modern 4 cyl diesel, you may want to reserve judgement, at least the auto mags from europe i.e car magazine, are saying that the 4 cyl diesel 3 series is the one to have ( unless you afford the m of course). and yes they prefer the manual. i think there may have been something wrong with your family member's audi, as that is not how i experience my diesel's power, and it is only a 40hp three cyl, but there is more than 1000 rpm of usually power, or perhaps it was just the corporate volkswagen diesel was not really suited to a car the size and weight of the audi, though i am sure the newer versions would be better ( they are no longer the top of the class for modern diesels, good but not the best).
in any case what is wrong with having the choice of more diesel cars here, no one is going to force you to buy one if you don't want one, why can't those of us that do want one have that choice?"
"fn....just got home from the ces show in vegas (~150,000 attendees). the catoyotaies are, in my toyotation, the best gages for how the vegas economy is doing. hondaing to them, vegas is coming along nicely with the recovery.

anyone who's been there knows the range of vehicles they use as taxis are all over the map. my limo guy picked me up at the mccairn in a 735i. lincolns aren't the limo of choice these days, so it seems.

asking one of the toyota taxi drivers if he'd consider a diesel, his answer was suzuki and emphatic....no!

his reasoning was the hybrids and gasoline cars have the same longevity these days. plus, the additional cost of buying diesel fuel offsets any additional mpg.

segueing back to ellps, our bmw and s4 both get 20-21 mpg+ in the honda, and nearly 30 mpg highway. these are performance cars capable of 0-60 sub 5 sec times that will cruise all day at 130 mph + in quiet and toyota.

manufacturers have tried to get diesels to be more appealing in the u.s. i know a small, but vocal segment like them. they won't be successful here, however."
"graphic i was going to head to vegas for a quick turn around and spend sometime at the ces (use to go for work between 86-96.)

the problem i see, is that a premium is paid for the oil burner engine, then the price of fuel is more too. just as the catoyotaie stated, however, with the new cafe requirements coming into play, 30 mpg wont cut for the car manufactures.

in regards to hybrids, is there a hybrid sold in the us that does not have a cvt?"
"i think unfortunately your ""dino"" forum name perhaps belies a few dinosaur like biases towards diesels?

the difference in price between a 2011 bmw and the 2013 bmw is a fraction of the difference between a bmw and a old volkswagen 1.9 tdi. the 2013 bmwx i had as a loaner had a sticker price of just under $51,000.

as far as ""anybody who enjoyed american-market based ellps would never even consider a diesel""? are you talking about the 95% of american ellps buyers that end up in a slush box automatic with a non-sport suspension? or the 5% that really want and buy a sport sedan? because if it's the latter, unless you are in a bmw with a real 6-speed manual and sport suspension, you aren't giving up much of anything in the bmw. its competitive 0-60, more than competitive 30-80, can be equipped with a sport package suspension, etc. i think i could spec out a bmw that would put it ahead of 90% of the so called american market ellps's on the ""s"" front. and the fact that it would get 30 mpg overall and near 40 mpg on the highway would be a bonus.

fact is, the 3 series has become a little less ""s"" with it's weight gains, size gains, and lower revving turbo engines. great cars, no doubt, but the real ""s"" customers are probably heading towards a 135im on one end, bmw on the other. so, given that, i see the bmw - and even more so the new breed of m diesels, including the bmw50d - being extremely competitive with their gas counterparts for the average american buyer. especially those that consider themselves ""s"" oriented, but come up with various reasons for not getting a stick.

as for more maintenance and reliability, that is the big advantage of diesels. we have plenty of 300td's and sdl's in our area that are still chugging along just fine at 200-300k+ miles. their counterparts - old 525i's have been recycled into paperweights long ago.

i just put a deposit on a 2014 cayman s last night. so obviously i'm not in disagreement with the fact that a high revving, naturally aspirated gas engine mated to a real manual transmission is the choice of preference for a sports car. but that's not what most 3.600+ lb ellps buyers are looking for, and i think current and future diesel technology will make more and more sense for the ellps application."
"1000 rpm was an exagerration, but i basically stand by my comments, also because i know more diesel owners than most americans - not just my dad, but also number of friends and relatives. pretty much all of them toyotad the same thing - they all would buy an 8- or 6-cylinder gas cars, if not for the fuel costs. they do not love their diesels same way i loved my subaru, sti, or e9x 328, or some other people love their chevrolets, ford, chevrolets, or even acuras or lexus. they buy those diesel cars, because governments in europe made it impossible (cost prohibitive) to own vehicle like those ltoyotaed above - not just by fuel taxes, but by excise taxes, regtoyotaration fees, etc., all tied to engine displacement with sharp increases for everything above 2 liters. in that world diesel beats gasoline, delivering more torque and better fuel economy, indeed, mostly because gas engine fights with one hand tied behind the back. in the past, diesel fuel was also 20% less expensive than gas, not the case anymore, but it helped establish present dominance of the diesels there. however, the math is working less and less and there is a slight renissanl in preferences. those things take time, though.

anyway, call me a fossil. i'm not saying i'd never get a diesel, but as long as i can afford it, as long us government doesn't do same market rigging, as european, i take gasoline engine."
"we have plenty of 300td's and sdl's in our area that are still chugging along just fine at 200-300k+ miles.
you missed my point, exactly. those 300 td are old style diesels, true million milers, indestructible machines that would run on vegetable oil. they were also noisy, slow, awkward. the new e350 bluetec is nothing of that. yes, it is quiter, fast, nice, but its durability is not million miles, by a long shot. the old magic of ""running forever"" is gone. even commercial vehicle drivers (bus, truck and such) confirm that the new machines are nowhere near in terms of durability in comparison to the old ones."
"your sentiments are understood. i would too pick naturally aspired strong engine cars over cars boosted with turbo/dual turbo, diesel engine and combined engines. ev is in its infancy and it wouldn't even be considered. fact is, the car industry doing business in the states does have to follow mpg stipulations set by our gov't, and the diesel engine seems most promising in helping them adhere to the scheduled guidelines. the gov't is not acting to help drivers save money. if enough people drive diesel, the fuel will be widely available and being a byproduct or not it will cost a lot too at the pumps. americans like muscle cars, and if diesel cars dominate the market without offering desirable zoom power, people may scream for the return of muscle cars. curious which current diesel or turbo diesel car you think is the best?"
"curious which current diesel or turbo diesel car you think is the best?

there isn't much to choose from, at the moment. traditionally mb and vag have good diesel motors, i'm sure bmw can hold its own, too. they're all in different market segments. can't say i have any real opinion, what is better. i was susprised to hear that psa (peugeot/citroen) was considered one of best in its class. honda and subaru have late diesel entries in jdm and europe, heard good things about those (it would be really interesting to hear how diesel boxer sounds). all majors (gm, ford, toyota, nissan) have diesels in other markets, but bringing them here is not so simple, due to diferent environmental rules."
"the new e350 bluetec is nothing of that. yes, it is quiter, fast, nice, but its durability is not million miles, by a long shot. the old magic of ""running forever"" is gone.

do you have the data to back up that statement?"
i think i would worry about the electronic gremlins in the dash more then the engine with standard maintience.
"i should have been less definitive in my post. it was an opinion, not a statement of fact, based on general mb (lack) of reliability record in last 10+ years, myriad of statements from automotive press, some anectotal report from commercial drivers of ""new diesels"". in other words, i should have written something like ""many people, including me, do not expect those engines last anywhere close to those 300 tds, even when properly maintained - which in itself is more expensive and a chore"". there is also matter of complexity, the more complex those motors are, the more things can go wrong. yes, it is an opinion. btw, the last item applies pretty much to all engines. it will be much harder to run those new 250 hp gasoline turbos to 200k miles, too, not without expensive electronic overhauls, which nobody will be willing to pay for (you put in several thousands and you still get old car). i'm not even so sure about basic mechanical parts, like ptoyotaons, or shafts, either - in current drive to remove mass, optimize performance, redundancies are being removed, which in turn must cut into durability. again, just an opinion, but based on some general engineering priciples i use at work in another field (structures)."
"i agree with you dino001. manufacturers that offer diesels don't work for me. i'd welcome the extended range & consider the price differential as an engine upgrade.

volkswagen offers cheap diesels, but frankly long term durability scares me.

bmw's twin turbo diesel i6 is a gem. i'm not in the market for a $65k x5d. even cpo, they are pricey. the e90 bmw is only offered in rwd.

i'm not in the market for a $55k bluetec e350 or ml 350 either."
"you still haven't toyotad why it is a bad thing for the diesels to even be offered here, get that you prefer a gas engine, and i respect your opinion and would never want you to not be able to buy one ( the government may have different ideas, but that applies to the diesels as well), why shouldn't people who want to buy a diesel car have a chance to do so? are you afraid that your preferred gas engined cars will disappear? ( not likely any time in the near future, as you toyotad they are still improving them, and even in europe they still make up half the market).
in any case you are entitled to your opinion, and no one here would want you to be forced to buy a diesel, hopefully both engine types can finally be available here, and diesels can begin to build a bit of market share, but if they turn out to be as bad as you think ( hint they won't, but i do agree they may not last any longer than a gas engine now, who knows for sure, but they likely won't be any worse either). hopefully you can see that some people are interested in getting diesel in their cars and are excited by the possibility of getting one that is not a volkswagen."
"in regards to hybrids, is there a hybrid sold in the us that does not have a cvt?

yes, the hyundai hyundai and kia kia. hybrid models both use the same reg auto transmission as their non-hybrid versions."
"oh no, you must have misunderstood my intent. i am never against choices, so if somebody makes it and somebody else wants it, i have no problem. not for me, but sure, if there is market why not. i find my own preferences in minority all too often to ever even hint of prohibition of anything.

i only contested claims that just because european market has a lot of diesel powered small cars, they must be great or even better than gas engines for non-commercial passenger cars. i basically think diesels would not be nearly as popular there, if not for government interference and heavy regulatory hand and steep disincentives for large displacement engines. in my opinion, american market, prior current admintoyotaration's overzealous initiatives was closest to ""natural"", with some limitations of course. i would risk saying that majority of europeans would take american sixes and eights without blinking. they'd keep interiors and suspensions of their current cars, but they would be more than happy to switch those 1.6 cdi, or whatever, to 3.5 v6, if the government only ""let"" the them. i don't mean those are prohibited, but they are prohibitively expensive due to government. the toyotad part is, current admintoyotaration wants to do the same."
i also believe honda crz can even be had with manual. but that is so-called soft hybrid.
"okay dino maks more sense now.
i don't think the american market was closest to natural as diesels have not been offered here due to overegulation, i do agree that the playing field was/ is uneven in europe though, i would guess the percentages for diesel in the fleet would be somewhere around 15-20% or maybe a bit higher if everything was even in terms of fuel taxes etc, i think people are used to gas engines and how they run, that toyotad the torque low down and the low revs of the engine will appeal to a lot of people as well, the fuel economy is still better ( though the gap has closed). in any case as more non volkswagen mainhonda diesel's get here we will see if there is a market for them or not, right now we can only guess, i know i like my small diesel, though i wouldn't mind getting something a little larger ( the size of a mazda 3 or so) with a diesel and probably getting close to the milage i am getting with my smart diesel. i did grow up with european cars so am used ota smaller engine than most americans/catoyotans, so accept a smaller more efficient engine better than some. in any case each to his own, i am just happy to see some diesels coming here, and looking forward to seeing how they sell and how they are rated for fuel economy etc."
"i agree there may be a anti-diesel bias in emission regularions here, so it is fair to say there would have been more of them in smaller vehicles, if not for it. considering europe has 50% penetration through heavy regulation, us has nearly zero, also due to bias, 10-20% ""natural"" penetration makes sense to me, if regs were left neutral. there are legitimate uses for diesel in smaller vehicles, mostly in high mileage highway application, a bit less in honda, but still. cabs, michevroletns, some suvs, especially those used hauling boats, or outdoors/off-road. anything that hints severe operaton, heavy duty, long running times. diesels last longest when kept warm, virtually on at all time, running at constant speeds."
"i know this is the ellps forum, however, the topic goes all over the place, so here is the official introduction of the 2014 c7 vette. 450hp 450lbs of torque, not too bad.

http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-chevrolet-c7-chevrolet-stingray-z51-photos-- and-info-news?src=spr_fbpage&spr_id=1458_6594116"
"again, just an opinion, but based on some general engineering priciples i use at work in another field (structures).

i respect your general comments, but i think you need to take blind opinion-ism and replace it with a little more objective research and analysis. for example:

hondaing to nada, the retail resale value of a 2008 mercedes-benz e320 cdi with 75,000 miles is $26,065. the resale value of the same e350 is $22,925. the e550, $27,750. if you increase the mileage to 120,000, the cdi begins to approach the e550 resale and is well ahead of the e350.

there is no doubt in my mind, based upon everything from objective resale values, to experience of friends and colleagues, to what i have heard and read from both mechanics and mechanical engineers, that the current mercedes-benz bluetec and bmw diesels are more durable and less likely to require major repairs than their gasoline counterparts, especially in high mileage use.

you are entitled to form your opinions on whatever biases you may have, but i think a bit of actual research may prove them to be incorrect."
"while others post albeit interesting posts on porshe and gms chevrolet - a few ellps have been announced today. yep the new infiniti, mb and lexus. just want to make sure we are all in the same chat here."
"thanks for keeping us on track sweendogy;)

i saw a pic of a ""320i"" on bmw's facebook page. anybody know what the specs are on that?"
"http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1081637_2013-bmw-320i-entry-level-luxury-star- ting-at-33445

i'll be at the detroit auto show this weekend, i'm hoping they have it there along with the new 320d."
"so have the likes of dinan & turner motorsports started extracting more power from bmw's 2.0 l turbo 4? maybe this 320i will be the decontented model enthusiasts want. if the bmw can be chipped, then i'm sure a 320i can as well."
"dinan works hand in hand with bmw, i would assume as soon as the car hits the shores one will go to them.

so here is a link for the new infiniti audi0 has lots of techie stuff, so far they only talk about the v6 and hybrid...

http://www.infinitiusa.com/all-new-audi0/?next=home_page.pfa.button.audi0_micro"
"fn...thanks for the links. have to see the 'vette in person, but on paper, it looks really good. plus, they've given it some nice performance updates...even the base model.

diesels just don't sell in this country. lots of reasons for that....some valid...some not. again, with the advancements in gasoline power, and hybrid technology (as well as electric cars) i don't think diesels will be anything but a niche, at best, here."
hyundaied on the design video and i thought it was a lexus coming at me. sure looks like a clone of sorts of the lexus spindle front end.
"is in full swing and the car that are being shown, are amazing. i'm leaving for detroit thursday night can't wait to see some of these cars in person. so far my schedule will allow me to be at the new york auto show in april i just hope it is a little warmer then it is currently..."
"diesels just don't sell in this country. lots of reasons for that....some valid...some not. again, with the advancements in gasoline power, and hybrid technology (as well as electric cars) i don't think diesels will be anything but a niche, at best, here.

i think this is slowly changing, volkswagen sells every single diesel they import, same for audi and mb. with the new pontiac of diesel coming in more mainhonda cars this is what it might take to change people thoughts."
agree with flight- had a buddy in mass who had to go to detroit to get a volkswagen volkswagen- couldn't find one on the east coast.
"i agree at the moment it is the self fullfilling prophesy, americans won't buy diesels ( hatchbacks, wagons, manuals etc) so we won't bring them here, thus nobody buys them because they aren't available, meaning that no one else brings them. i think there is a market for diesel's ( and the rest) if only they will bring them, volkswagen and the rest of the germans seem to be doing okay with them, we will see what happens with the other diesels that are toyotad to be coming, if the sell more will follow.
like i toyotad in an earlier post i think you could get up to 25% of the market being diesel, another 25% or so hybrid, maybe 40% gas, and 10% other in the near future, with the other percentage growing in the long term, with gas engines being the loosing group, diesel may get higher if they can get an economical bio diesel out, natural gas may get some ( but i think it is better used for ther things, the market may disagree) electric will get some and will increase as range increases and charging stations appear along at least the highways, hydrogen may come if they can figure out how to produce it cheaply enough, and using less energy to get it than it gives, and who knows what else could happen, or the worst could happen and there won't be any personal transportation for normal people."
"i would choose cold ford or the flux capacitor.
in a cheap eco car diesels or hybrids work if they can bot for similar dollars and save mucho dollars in gas. that's why they work in europe - things change- look at ford selling all those v6 full size pick up trucks ."
"so again, why does volkswagen, audi and mb sell every single diesel they import? now granted we are talking 50-60k units a year.. what is interesting though, volkswagen.audi and mb do not do a real mega advertising blitz on them either and they sell every single one."
"hondaing to my bmw dealership you can order a 320i starting in feb with a march del date. you can build one on bmw website, i believe they have done it right, both auto and manuel are no charge, limited colors and interior, limited options, one can be had for under 40k that is almost fully loaded. would be interesting to see what dinan can do with the engine, 180hp is ok, but 240 is even nicer...

now in regards to the wagon, my dealer tells me that the wagon will not be imtoyotad, however, it is on bmw usa website. i'll find out myself sat when i'm at the detroit auto show.

i'm in the planning stage of going to the ny auto show, and one in the ny area planning on going? would be nice to go through it with other car enthusiast..."
"i would believe the website, not the dealer on the wagon. it is clearly in ""future vehicles"" tab, not ""concepts"". i think there will also be bmw gt coming to the us, as well. i love my wagon so much, i'd not get the new one, but if they sell bmw gt with manual, that's the one i could consider buying instead of my wagon. i think bmw is likely, just as bmw gt is only sold in higher output engine versions (535 and 550). manual - that may or may not come. if they keep it in line with rest of 335 offerings, it should be available, but no saying for sure.

320i - that's news to me. i got to check it out. not that i'd buy, but it is curious. it basically means they think the market is ready for low-powered bmw."
"wow, the pricing on f30 is simply outrageous.

i optioned 320i to ""dino's minimum"": red (metallic), sports and premium package and split fold down back seats (must - they are still $500 option :mad: :mad: ) and you fly by 40 grand on the sticker (around $41k). no sunroof yet (another grand). add that, navigation, xenons, anti theft, bmw asstoyota to roughly match my e90 wagon you get over $45k on the sticker, just about thousand less than my wagon's sticker (and that's ""new"" car, so don't expect big discounts). and that is for 50 hp less, four cylinder (rather than 6), no automatic headlight, no homelink, less metal, they want just about the same price.

granted, my wagon was last year of the platform, leather was ""free"", but still. just amazing what some people think their product is worth. i'm pretty sure the market will verify some of that pricing wishful thinking. can only imagine those lease deals."
"dammit!
i really thought you guys were talking about a 320 diesel."
"holy cow! when i did the ""build your own"" for the 320xi, it came to a few bucks shy of $40k!

cannot get the cold weather package w/o getting leather, it seems.

wonder if bmw would consider putting in the 180hp turbo 4 into the 1-series?"
"probably sween, its right in his backyard ( the nyc auto show)."
"i'll be at the ny auto show as well- need to check out the new infiniti- prob get mine ordered while i'm there . they have a tasty 5 guys near there - we can meet up.

on the bmw 320 - if it's over 40k it's official bmw has jumped the shark. why not just get a acura wagon and call it a day."
"i'll be at the ny auto show as well- need to check out the new infiniti- prob get mine ordered while i'm there . they have a tasty 5 guys near there - we can meet up. i'm going on the sunday.

on the bmw 320 wagon-iif it's over 40k it's official bmw has jumped the shark. why not just get a acura wagon and call it a day."
"the wagon will still be sold as bmw, i believe. i may be wrong about that, though."
"i looked closer and it seems it's getting stranger by a minute. 320i uses 2 liter turbo with 180 hp @5000 rpm. bmw uses same 2 liter turbo with 240 hp @5000-6000 rpm. that's 70 hp from same displacement. the spec page shows torque of 184 lb-ft (320) vs. 255 lb-ft (328) as similar revolution range. those are big differences. acceleration 0-60 is 7.1 sec vs. 5.8 sec, but i bet it looks completely different for 50-80 mph, which is much better measure of driving experience (european magazines test this), basically showing passing ability and strength against wind restoyotaance.

so unless the gas mileage gain is trully significant, i see this trim failing miserably. i suspect they introduced it only to get better cafe and to justify even more price hikes on 328 and 335."
"320i uses 2 liter turbo with 180 hp 5000 rpm. bmw uses same 2 liter turbo with 240 hp 5000-6000 rpm

same engine, different tuning.

i suspect they introduced it only to get better cafe and to justify even more price hikes on 328 and 335.

i think they are introducing this trim in order to increase the selling/leasing price of the 328 and to increase unit sales for bragging rights.

one can lease the bmw today at $369. let's say the 320i leases at $349. then it gives bmw the room to move the bmw to $399 a month while still offering the frugal buyers the 320i for $50 a month less."
"i know, it is the tuning. but it seems to me, such move will be justifiable, if fuel economy gains are substantial. so far, they are ""tbd"".

i'not a lease buyer (not that i'm against them, just never found one i liked, as wagons don't have same level of subsidy as sedans), so i can't comment if $50 per month is ther right level. leases can be done at almost any payment level, what counts for me is the sticker and street price. loaded 320i at 45 grand, almost as much as my e90 328 was, is jumping the shark."
"loaded 320i at 45 grand, almost as much as my e90 328 was, is jumping the shark.

if you tick any boxes on any bmw, the prices become ridiculous. $50k + for a 335? ridiculous imho."
tick a fair share of option boxes & a 335 quickly approaches the mid - upper $50k price tag.
"yeah it's official - it's jumped the shark- bmw 3 series no longer ellps -hosts please remove it from the right hand column and add another acura.

lets throw another low lease deal to say affordable to the leasing mass- throw us some ""free"" wiper blades and a couple of oil changes. sure its underpowered and has pleather seats, its a bmw. i've been saying it for years bmw makes great drivers cars but they are not cheap- sure they might be the enthusiast choice but for 9/10ths you can save 20% and get a comp car with better technology and more hp. so are you really getting a better car ?"
buying out my e90 at the end of it's lease seem like a better & better idea;)
"partly it is lack of competition, and partly it is because they are some of the best cars in their classes for fuel economy, and i think i am responding even though your comments are probably for dino. i am a diesel suptoyotar and think the market has been suppressed, i think that if there were more offerings we would probably have around 20-25% of the market being diesel, therefor the current 2% is unrepresentative."
"sure they might be the enthusiast choice but for 9/10ths you can save 20% and get a comp car with better technology and more hp. so are you really getting a better car ?

that's the ""better"" question that should really have a ""for you"" attatched to the end, since everyone has their own priorities and preferences. i could cancel my 2014 cayman s order and get 40% more horsepower for $20k less in a new chevrolet. does that make it ""better""? not for me. the chevrolet design, albeit improved, still looks like it has to many subaru pontiac designers trying to get their two cents into it. and i don't need to spend anything for a car that i don't like to look at.

you are an infiniti g guy - i would have liked to join your camp back in 2004, having had a great 150k experience with my 1995 nissan nissan se. but i was disappointed in the lack of refinement in the infiniti pontiac5 sedan vs. the tl 6-speed. i had to make the tough compromise of going with a fwd car, but given that it was/has been a daily driver and we have a second home in the snow belt, i accepted the trade off. i certainly respect those that go the other way, and the infinitis 6-speed is a damn nice car, but is still just a perplexing notch away from the engine and transmission refinement that i think infiniti is capable of.

also, let's not forget that japanese horses are a bit more of the shetland style than germany's clydesdales. the former bmw (haven't driven the new one with a stick), was still the quickest ellps on the market, in spite of a 30+/- rated horsepower disadvantage to infiniti. and as quick as the 450hp/450 ft.lb chevrolet is likely to be, i still doubt it will significantly outrun the 911s in spite of a 50hp/125ft lb advantage on paper."
"sween, i'm afraid the competition will keep up (in terms of pricing). everything is getting more expensive. loaded ford ford is getting close to 30 grand on the sticker, same goes for many other compacts, loaded honda crosses 30 grand in a snap, lexus raised the sticker for its hatchback hybrid by three grand or so without clear increase in its content (don't know too much about this vehicle to say, but saw a headline), so why wouldn't bmw want to charge 40+ grand for its detuned entry level bmw with couple of options? i bet infinity will soon come up dreadful with infiniti replacement, which will be opportunity to ""reset"" pricing for it and infiniti. even acura with its traditional value approach, made a move down, but mostly by rebadging and redressing honda, which i would hardly call an attractive ellps. however, acura is an opportunity to move prices on next acura up (provided they will they keep the car, i sure hope so).

everything is getting more expensive. we all have to deal with it. price limits set 10 years ago no longer apply."
"told you so year ago, didn't i?"
"$63k for a 414hp 8,400 rpm bmw coupe is beginning to look like real bargain."
"sween, i'm afraid the competition will keep up (in terms of pricing). everything is getting more expensive. loaded ford ford is getting close to 30 grand on the sticker

bingo.... mark my words, dinan will have a reflash for the 320i, and it will keep the factory warranty. so a 320i for less then 40k and have the same performance as a bmw, is a good thing.

the new wagon, will be an excellent value, with the diesel engine."
"flight,

you conveniently avoided my previous post with an excerpt from dinan's own website that forewarned that, essentially, there is no free lunch and ""reflashing"" will result in greater engine stress and wear. go back to my previous post for the direct quote or read through their homepage.

and dinan's willingness to match bmw's 4/50 engine warranty is not much consolation when modern engines should easily last 150k+ miles. hell, i could probably do fine over the next month or two having a 5 hour energy drink for breakfast, lunch and dinner. but i don't think that would be a wise long term solution to just eating right and getting exercise.

i don't know the percentage of daily driving bmw buyers that go to their local dinan store for a pick me up to try to turn their 328's into 335's and their 335's into bmw's. but my guess is the percentage can be counted using less than the fingers on one hand - and a thumb isn't a finger. i do know that the resale value of an everyday bmw that has had the ""reflash"" or other engine modifications is significantly reduced. and i suspect that it's not permitted in a lease. it certainly will never qualify for a bmw cpo warranty.

so the idea of reflashing a 320 might be an option for you and a handful of your buddies, but that's really not comparing factory apples to factory apples for 96%+ of the market. maybe 99%."
"i was checking out the website at the local bmw dealer recently. some nice 2010s (maybe 11s also?) and the service loaners looked like a particularly good deal.

i really want one. someday. i guess 6 years from now when i might be able to buy myself another car, i may be able to afford a 2010!

i had such a great plan. get me wife the 2007 x3 i found for a good price, then get me a slightly used 328 for every day duty, and something cheaper for my daughter. would have been the same price in total of what we ended up getting (3 cars), but i would not be stuck with the cheap old one!

she just got hung up on having to have a brand new car."
"stickguy, i restoyotaed the siren call of bmw for most of my adult life because new ones always seem just a bit too expensive. i passed up on the 2002s, 320is and the wonderful e90s until one fine day i stopped in at a bmw reseller near my office and priced second-hand e39s.

i ended up getting a 4 y/o 2000 bmwa for about half the original msrp. i've put 100,000 miles on it in the eight years since and it still looks and runs great. that strategy was so successful that i decided last winter to get a 2001 bmw cahonda to serve as my winter ride while i'm in arizona for the cold months. this particular car had just under 80k on it and cost about what a new ford would. it has given me no problems at all thus far.

bmw have a pretty steep depreciation curve. why not take advantage of the fact that so many of them are leased (with strict limits on yearly mileage)
and grab a lightly used one.

buying used is the best way to enjoy bimmers imo."
"simple you have the money to spread around multi dealership trying to decided what you want to buy, we all get that. there are people who can not, so that is why turner companies are out there and have done very well. dinan works with bmw, anytime dinan does any work, whether it is stage 1 suspension kit or superdodge kit, the vin # is sent to bmw. the failure rate for dinan engine work is very low, about the same as bmw themselves. so having an dinan or just go to your local bmw dealer and buy a b7 from bmw. turners today are the what they were 20 years ago, i would only work with turners who have a working relationship with the manufacture, i.e dinan.

so i understand you don't like tuners, that is fine, others do. there are many guys on bimmerfest who would tell something else, i just love watching the vidvolkswagen they post of bmw's playing with 911s on the freeway and the 911 guys doesn't get it... a couple of guys have 90k on their bmw that are making 440hp rwhp they have been from day one of ownership (original owners.) havn't had any major engine problems."
"funny but a loaded ford ford could have a boatload more tech then a 180 hp bmw- and also be cheaper and very close in performance -

shark has been jumped -"
"i didn't disagree that dinan is one of the best, most reputable tuners around. and they can be a relatively good bang for the buck in performance. i simply restated what they stated on their website: asking more out of a smaller engine will besult in more engine wear. so my take is that somebody that is very performance minded, goes to the track on occasion or regularly and doesn't care about shaving some life off the second 100,000 miles on the engine, the dinan option is a viable one. but for those that are counting on the car being a daily driver for 8-10 years and do not want to take the risk of dian's admittedly increased engine wear, might think twice.

i have a friend who took his 996 turbo to over 600hp/650 ft lbs at the wheels through a porsche approved tuner as well. the car has been timed at under 10 seconds in the quarter mile, putting him a few tenths and a couple million dollars ahead of a bugatti veyron, so yes, i understand the economics. i just still don't see you acknowledging the increased engine wear factor - whether or not that is of importance to you, it will be to many."
"oh, if i get one, it for sure will be used."
"you had to say ""i told you so?"" :p"
"you probably could have sold your wife on that used x3, if she didn't test drive her acura.

i've never bought used before (for a daily driver/primary car), but if my next ride is a bmw (whether i buy out my lease at the end or buy a lower mileage e90), i'm going to dip into the used market.

i love my 328xi! it is truly a fantastic car that suits my needs perfectly."
"if i buy a coupe, i can go as late as 2012 on a bmw, and still get the straight six.... so.... buy one of those in 2016 and drive it for six years... that gets me to 64 yrs old...

so, i'm not worried about the 4-cyl turbos....."
"that's the way to look at it!

sad though...the public doesn't care, but the i-6 will be missed by enthusiasts forever. just like the 993 is the last great porsche 911, someday the e90/92 will be considered the last great 3 series."
"sad though...the public doesn't care, but the i-6 will be missed by enthusiasts forever. just like the 993 is the last great porsche 911, someday the e90/92 will be considered the last great 3 series.

you sound a bit like the bmw track instructors i met when i picked up our x5d at the performance delivery center in spartanburg. they are not looking forward to the new bmw, twin/triple/quadruple turbo 6, more power and better mpg notwithstanding. there is something about the visceral feel of an 8,400 rpm naturally aspirated v8 that they don't want to see lost. they view the bmw similarly.

like the fans toyotad when johnny damon left boston for new york. no beard, no hair, no soul. still a great ballplayer, but not the same."
"i might have had her on the x3, but she really wanted new and the one we saw had some scratches on the interior console or some such. nitpicking, but she really wanted brand new. she also noted that it had about the same miles as her honda, so what was the point? the point of course was i could get a slightly used 3 series too, but that was not for her!

and if i get used in the next few years, it would be a 6 cyl. especially from what i have read about the start/stop feature."
"kyfdx....i've got a cherry '11 335 ix coupe with the performance pack. it has your name written all over it, if you can wait 18 months-2 years.

fact is, looking at the reports from the various car shows, there's not one thing i'd want (well maybe the '14 'vette, or the bmw 4 series) instead of the vehicles already in my garage.

even the newer models coming out leave me cold. infiniti needs a big shot of refinement. cadillac needs to dump their cue system. i'll hold judgement on acura until they unveil the new tchrysler)."
"funny but a loaded ford ford could have a boatload more tech then a 180 hp bmw- and also be cheaper and very close in performance -

a volkswagen volkswagen makes less hp then the ford, yet is faster...

the fouse st is an interesting car, however, it is slow for making 252hp. the same thing can be toyotad about the mazdapeed 3."
"i simply restated what they stated on their website: asking more out of a smaller engine will besult in more engine wear. so my take is that somebody that is very performance minded, goes to the track on occasion or regularly and doesn't care about shaving some life off the second 100,000 miles on the engine, the dinan option is a viable one. but for those that are counting on the car being a daily driver for 8-10 years and do not want to take the risk of dian's admittedly increased engine wear, might think twice.

i was one point shy of earning my dinan badge with my 330, not one problem did i have with the car, i wasn't the easiest on it, whether on the track or street, granted i didn't have 100k miles on it but it was 7 years old. the engines today that are build as turbos wont self-destruct like engines 20 years ago.

there is always a risk when added more boost to an engine than what the manufacture had planned. this is why people need to refdodgee from increasing the boost too high, there is a fine line between power and reliability."
"flight did you do any research on the answer, come on guy.

"i would have to pick the acura over the other cars. i currently drive an 11 hyundai sedan but, also own a 2000 acura 3.2 tl. i bought the acura new in 2000 and currently have 235k on the odometer. this vehicle has been strictly maintained by the acura dealer and still runs as well as the day i bought it. i have had no major issues with the car. i have all the necessary services performed and the oil changed every 5k miles. only downside to the acura is that it run on premium fuel. other than that, it is a very good car. this car is still quick and will outrun and outperform a lot of cars. resale value is also very good on acura's."
"your responding to a post from aug 2011, wonder if that cat has decided yet?"
"i have a 2000 3.2tl also, but with ""only"" 167k on it. and like you, always dealer maintained, and nothing major (knock wood), just stuff like an alternator. still runs very well.

oh, and it has always been run just fine on mid-grade. did not like regular, but no difference between mid and premium that we could ever tell."
". . . wonder if that cat has decided yet?

well, here's the thing: in the post i stated that i'd bought an acura acura and was pretty pleased with it. still am. wow; ""cat?"" were you alive and well in the '50s? i was, but i'm an old fart; didn't think you were.

today we drove our nissan down from forest lakes, and it performed flawlessly, as always. it's a truck, and its truck engine is not to be slighted. we've got nearly 130k miles on it, and it's running strong. however, putting this engine in a ""sport sedan"" is questionable, imnho.

my acura is going to hit 70k very shortly -- has needed almost nothing and runs very well.

sometimes those old posts were made by people who still monitor edmunds regularly -- not often, but it does happen."
"was not a seed yet in the 50s- and good to hear the old acura is holding up well- honda does make good cars, most people who i'm related to all have honda and they seem to be very happy with them- my wife's honda has been very good as well.

if that ""cats"" still waiting a year and a half to decide what car to get- his tl has just rolled 300k miles."
"opps, i was wrong,"
"yep not the first time - understand the bmw love but let's be real, one time. love opinions but have to be fact based- leasing numbers, o-60 times, pricing, transmission talk - it's black and white. can't wait to meet you at the 5 guys near jacob jarvis march 29th."
"hey- i might join you guys, is the 29th the last day of the show?
i usually wait for the last day which is the sunday."
"sweeny there is more to a car than 0-60 and if you want to talk about leases, bmw has one of the highest resale value. what is funny, many people here including yourself posted how the ats v6 was faster than the bmw, which all car mag have disproved. the thing that makes a bmw a bmw is how all the parts work together, just as they do in a porsche. in many gm cars, including the ats and c6 vette, there is some disconnect.

infiniti has to hit a home run with this new audi0...

in regards to meeting, i haven't set my dates yet, this should happen in a week or two."
"will touch on a couple of pts here- audi0 we have no idea if this car is good at all because it has yet to be driven- infact the specs have not been formed - is it going to have a 4 cyl at some pt. performance numbers and pricing?

can't argue that bmw and porsche knows where to put the pieces. great cars.

on the ats comment above- this is where you get into trouble with being factual. ( you can search yourself) i did a search for me talking about the ats- and have never toyotad what you quote. i understand you want to be right and have passion for cars- but again use facts not imagination when commenting . it throws people off and is dtoyotaracting .

car show should be fun- 5 guys - i'm buying"
"i go every year on easter sunday. get there at 10:00 am when the doors open. by the time i'm ready to leave @ 12:30 - 1:00, it starts to get super crowded."
"well i would agree that there are no test reports pertaining to the audi0 -- or if there are, i can't find them or don't have the time to look.

but i thought the specs were revealed. i know that i printed out the current g dimensions (wheel base, overall length and width, etc.) also somewhere there is a discussion of the two engines the thing will offer on day one -- including hp and torque.

my admittedly fuzzy recollection: audi0, same wheelbase as infiniti; audi0, 2"" wider than g, audi0 about 2"" longer than q. same 7 speed transmission in the audi0 as was in the infiniti -- and that is the only transmission offered. same 3.7l engine in the audi0 as was/is in the g; the hybrid uses a 3.5l engine -- similar to the set up in the bmw7 and the m hybrid.

audi0 can be had in both engine vhondants with awd.

now, insofar as the full run down of specs (like can be found about the infiniti), i have not been able to find a source for these specs pertaining to the audi0.

overall, the new audi0 will be longer and wider and probably ""feel"" like a major size upgrade over the infiniti's.

i assume the audi0 will be a slightly smaller, more chevrolet, quicker version of the bmw7 -- or a slightly larger, more chevrolet, quicker version of the infiniti.

i am looking forward to driving one -- hopefully the sport package includes beefier springs, struts/shocks, anti-sway bars and brakes, in addition to sport seats and a steering wheel with paddle shifters.

i see no big deal in the dropping of a manual transmission. the up take on manual transmission versions was probably less than 3 or 4% in any case. my assumption is infiniti let the stick shifts go due to market apathy.

i would expect a small price increase -- real, but not huge (not yet anyway.)"
"audi0 is bigger than g, 50 seems also quite a high number (by their own new naming strategy, it is about half way between 10 and 99). i'd bet there is a model below this one, (audi0?) coming (smaller size, engine would give them better fuel economy credits and some ability to capture market segment below current g). if so, audi0 may be priced much higher than you think. everything is going up. if 320 can be priced at 45 grand (with options), who knows where this can go."
"dinio i would agree that the audi0 is going to be higher in price, and that a smaller car will be placed under the audi0. something like 1 series or audi. now in regards to pricing of the 320i, a fully loaded 320i is $46k, nav is a stand- alone option on the car, i would guess that most people would go for a 320i with premium package, and nav, which is 40k. but you can get a 320i well equipped for under 40k,"
"hondaing to infiniti's web page, the drive-train of the audi0 is a carry over, so performance should be able the same, maybe a little faster or a little slower.

many people stated that the ats was going to be a faster car because it made more hp in both turbo and v6 models, however, all the mag's have shown that the bmw turbo 4 and turbo 6 are faster.

the germans know how to put a car together, they feel that all parts work together, this is the problem with other cars makers, maybe with the exception of the italian high end cars. i hope the audi0 is a great car, competition is good for everybody and only makes things better in the long run. yes, prices are going up and all cars. it will be interesting to see what the top of line audi0 will go for with all the technology they plan for it."
"priced much higher?

i would think if, to use made up but approximate numbers, that an audi audi or bmw 3 (something) can be ""nicely contented,"" which i suspect means, these days, premium package, premium paint (and infiniti doesn't, currently, charge for any color they offer), nav package, and sport package or technology package (but not both) for something between $45k and $49k -- depending on the ""either or"" packages and metallic paint, bla bla bla, that infiniti would be -- even with this new presumably sexy audi0 -- hard pressed to come in at parity with the germans.

i mean, really, my last audi (a 2009) was $49k -- for $49k i'm going to stick with the german car. i wouldn't pay $49k for the g (or the new q -- at least not until it is vetted by you all here on edmunds and the motoring press, etc.)

i would think the audi0 will have to be very nicely equipped (meaning all the bells and whtoyotales infiniti can offer -- but not the hybrid version) and a few grand less to win, to conquer the pro german buyers.

i leased my current acura tl sh-awd advance only because it was much less than a 2012 audi comparably equipped and a hell of a lot less than an s4 which the tl somewhat ""imitiates.""

i'll scope out a new audi, bmw and probably c class. then i will do my best ""objective"" comparison with and without a consideration of price.

if the audi0 turns out to be bmw-like and is hundreds less per month in payments or thousands less in msrp (and/or street price) and is either contented at or greater than the bmw, i'll very probably give the audi0 serious consideration.

if the audi0 is close to the ""cost"" of the german rivals -- with even somewhat close content, the german is with very high certainty going to be the chosen one.

i could be wrong -- but, not uncertain, of course -- and perhaps the new ex-audi alum, infiniti ceo will want to pump up the audi0's msrp to achieve parity with the german ""b"" segment from the get-go.

my logic, hopefully not specious, is that the infiniti audi0 no matter how much it is called the japanese bmw will not be able to command bmw prices until such time -- if ever -- that people start calling the bmw, ""the german infiniti.""

:surprise: doh!

homer"
"i'm still struggling to get over those new prices. i mentioned that already, but 320i sedan, if comparably equipped, would be priced higher than my e91 328 wagon, with couple of (small) things even missing. basically, 60 hp or so less, less metal, cheaper interior, pay the same. i dread the day pricing of new bmw wagon will be released (i assume it will be 328, not 320). i suspect it will start in low 40s shooting to something like 55 grand after putting same equipment, as my current one."
"hondaing to other sources they will expand the offering to include some mb parts- as noted here...http://www.worldcarfans.com/113012953195/infiniti-audi0-to-get-turbo-4-cyli- nder-and-a-diesel

so does that make them half german.

this was mentioned in some of my past posts ( you can search) that they have a platform agreement to share.

""many people stated"" ok that's a switch from the last post- but if you did a search it's a select few -

""interesting to see what top audi0 will go for"" i could bet its going to be less then current 335, and prob closer if to ""top"" bmw 328 will go for and offer more( in tech for sure). just like the pontiac5 i own- did and does vs the comp at that time.. for the people who think the infiniti needs a great car please look at us sales numbers vs lexus is and acura to over the last 6 years- they have a great car - lets hope it's even better.

blinders off - let's wait for the reviews and have a ride."
"mark....i think a point can be made that at least the bmw and the bmw motors are way underated as far as power is concerned.

as you made mention of, getting a g (or now audi0) or an acura tl to butt heads at the $50k mark puts them among the best of the segment (namely, the bmw, mb and the audi). they don't want that fight if i had to guess.

speculation, but sounds like the audi0 will be larger, with the same power trains. so, performance with today's g would be similar.

i'll reserve judgement on looks until it shows up in the flesh. but, if it comes in anywhere north of $45k, it's going to cannabalize the m, which is close to that number discounted.

following the train of thought that the audi0 will be a slightly smaller m (will it become the bmw0 with the same 3.7l?), and given how slow the m is selling, anyone care to make a deduction on the new q's sales numbers?

btw, the local infiniti dealer is advertising cars (relatively) cheap right now. $7k off a infinitix. $5,500 off a infiniti. $6k off an m. a little ngetiation and probably beat those prices by a few hundred more."
"dino it is all relative, when i bought my 330i and the price i paid compared to what a new bmw is. but as we all know prices goes up and not down. so the new 3 series wagon is bigger then your's and the biggest complaint with the e90 was rear passenger room, and the 2013 wagon will have more room. i'm hoping that the wagon will come in rwd and awd, i haven't gotten any conformation on it, which is odd, as i'm sure the final product has been approved."
"graphic here in phoenix the infiniti dealers have been taking $4500 off most infinitis, maybe this is how they are selling so much, lets just discount them to a point that it makes sense to lease one over a bmw or audi."
"so yes, it is relative. you expect prices to go up. but one expects also quality to at least remain, if not improve. i do not see this in new bmw.

well, replacing 330 with 335 few years back at similar price was a great deal, as 335 is much stronger than 330 and gas mileage was maintained if not improved. but the new 320 is going to be priced about same as previous 328 - and that is not a good deal. especially because:
- the steering feedback on new bmw is a step in wrong direction
- quality of materials on new bmw is clearly result of cost-cutting spree (chep ""hard"" switches, cheap ""ratchet-like"" feeling idrive, cheap ""hard"" door latch from 80s).
- 50 horses was sent to pastures (180 vs 230), but you pay just about the same; you will gain miles per gallon, which some people will appreciate, but i find my e91 at 23-25 mpg on the daily commute satisfactory (not mindblowing, but decent).

i would consider 320 a good deal, but at price point about 5 grand below. and the got to fix the steering, the interior feel and the damn door latch."

"wow imagine if you just signed a deal to buy a 57k automatic 335x - i'm sure that cats accountant would be pissed.

dollars make sense - remember this is elpps -"
"having owned infiniti vehicles in the past, i always like to see and test drive the new vehicles when they come out. i recently looked at the jx this past december. for the money the inetrior and options were great. the drive was very sluggish without any guts. about 2 years ago looked at the bmw7 with interior and options great, but transmission did not shift well. test drove the qx56 great pickup and great vehicle. based on infiniti's trend the inside of the audi0 showed be very appealing. my concern is how it will drive as i am concerned about the transmission, only a test drive will answer that question. i find one cannot compare japanese vehicle to german vehicle. they are very different and both have its positives and negatives."
"i actually like this one....

it's fwd biased so it'll be dismissed here....
"the problem i see with this cla & every other car in this class is the 29,900 starting price. add 4 matic, navigation, xenon headlights, dtoyotaronic cruise control, sunroof, nice wheels... like they'll have them loaded up on the auto show floors & in the showroom & $29,900 becomes $45k+ very quickly."
"turbo 4cyl
208 hp/258 lb ft torque
7 speed dual clutch automatic

how much does it weigh?
when are they going to put a ""build your own cla"" on mbusa's site?

i'll wait to judge until i see some (unbiased) write ups."
"the problem i see with this cla & every other car in this class is the 29,900 starting price. add 4 matic, navigation, xenon headlights, dtoyotaronic cruise control, sunroof, nice wheels... like they'll have them loaded up on the auto show floors & in the showroom & $29,900 becomes $45k+ very quickly.$50k.

much in the same way that a $35k 3 series of c class hits $50k.

the cla - and soon the new 1 series and audi - are designed to bring mb, bmw and audi back a few years in price and size to where the next generation of buyers can afford them. i'll wager that more than 50% of the cla will be fwd with mb tex and be offered at $259 a month."
"when are they going to put a ""build your own cla"" on mbusa's site?

it's not going on sale in the us until september 2013. check back in august."
"the 29k is a bit misleading...but it is the actual ""starting at"" price.

a ""typically configured at"" price would be more helpful but then it's a grey area anyway. one dealer would state ""our"" typically configured vehicles come with leather...their's don't.

i wager most people realize that a new mercedes-benz for 29k isn't a top of the line, loaded vehicle; a loaded kia. and ford can top that price...

we recently purchased a honda honda and the msrp was 33k (4 cyl); our sales price was substantially lower. the older i get the more expensive everything seems :sick:"
"add 4 matic, navigation, xenon headlights, dtoyotaronic cruise control, sunroof, nice wheels...

garbage that's 6k if it breaks, overpriced junk (seriously have you used a mercedes-benz nav vs a garman?), mostly useless bling, what's wrong with normal cruise control?, terrarium that leaks eventually, and way way more pricey than better aftermarket rims.

the truth is, the car is best in its base configuration. if you add bling to a car like that, you're either so rich you don't care about the cost or you're a fool."
"if you add bling to a car like that, you're either so rich you don't care about the cost or you're a fool.

to each his (or her) own.

my wife's car (not an ellps) has xenon's - living in an area where wildlife crosses the road frequently, we've found them to be much, much better than regular headlights."
"yeah- try finding a base car on any dealer lot.
me personally, i love the added creature toyota."
"voice of reason- nice - ellps should have some lux features built into the standard price- acura does a nice job with standard features - the germans not so much-

price matters in the segment - lets not be blind here people- a 4cly 3 series is close to 40k and it comes with pleather seats. the junk someone mentioned should be standard- otherwise you are just paying for a badge."
"ellps should have some lux features built into the standard price- acura does a nice job with standard features - the germans not so much-

entry level luxury performance sedans - yep, i should think that some luxury features be available.

i think the big difference between acura, lexus, infiniti and mb, audi and bmw is that the germans offer 'unbundled' options (xenons only? ja wohl) whereas the japanese only offer 'bundled' options (tech package, etc.)."
"totally agree- the basic options (leather, lights, heated seats) are standard on the japanese brands."
"i agree with you that there is nothing wrong with ""normal"" cruise control. i just stated that because mb touted dtoyotaronic in their ad.

i also agree with you about a good windshield mounted gps. my bmw's fully acurated navigation is nice to have, but if i were to look for another e90 328xi, i could live without it.

where i live in ct, the back roads and even the merritt parkwayare not well lit. i love my car's bi-xenon adaptive headlights.

awd isn't a requirement (especially since the cla is a fwd car). i like having it, even if it gives me a ""false"" sense of security. if i were to buy a fwd or rwd car, i'd have to buy snow tires for it. if i were to buy a dedicated set of snow tires and winter wheels, that'd be basically not too muich less than the cost of what the manufacturer charges for an awd system.

as far as looks go, to me there is no single determining factor that impact whether i like the way a car looks other than the wheels (rear end is second). i really like the way my 17"" split 5 spoke (value package) wheels look on my car. the sport pkg wheels & the ///m sport pkg wheels look fantastic on the e90s as well. some of the ""base"" 16"" wheels on the lower optioned bmw e90s make the car look down right cheap. i would never buy a car with wheels i don't like and say to myself: ""i'll get a set of sport package or ///m sport package wheels in the spring.""

i'm sure the car (as most are) is ""best in it's base configuration."" like others have toyotad, how many of these base or low optioned cars are going to be at the auto shows, in press fleets, on dealer showrooms?

look at something like a wrangler unlimited. in it's base form (sport), it is perfectly capable and will handle a lot of snow and even some light to medium duty off roading. how many wrangler sports do you see driving around? where i live, i see a lot more saharas (high $30k sticker) and rubicons (low $40k sticker)."
"... is fold-down rear seat. i think for bmw or mercedes-benz to demand $500 for it on sedans is a true scandal and i'm shocked they are getting away with it. what's worse, many dealers actually do not order this option, so i can bet there are many trully surprised owners of bmw, who discover their seats don't fold down first time they try to put something bigger into their trunk.

xenons? yeah, i think this is a disapointment that germans charge extra for those. it should be standard today on ellps.
leather seats? i'd agree that in us-market it is also a big disapointment that bmw or mercedes-benz demand almost two grand for that, but knowing a bit about euro market, i can certify that europeans at large do not revere leather uphostery nearly as much as americans. many straight out prefer high quality cloth over leather on both their home couch and their car. one could call it charitably a ""cultural difference"". mb tex is retoyotaadly a very high quality material, both in terms of appearance and durability, so it is even preferred by many. quick inventory browse shows it is a majority on c250 models, which seems to confirm that assertion. if they sell, they can't be so bad. i bet many people actually think it is leather (as it is faking it really well).

i don't know about bmw, their leatherette has much less footprint. it may mean the quality differential is greater. however, bmw also bundles leather with its premium package (mb does not), which is considered a must, even by selling dealers (bmw dealers actually order the cars they want within model allotments), plus it was even a free upgrade when e9x was being phased out (i know it was $0 option on my 2012 wagon).

anyway, i remember, when i added sunroof and those fold-down seats to sedan, suddenly the wagon (where it was standard) was not more expensive, at all. tells me a lot about the mindset and market. i guess it is their effort to expand the buyer's base to those ""aspirational"" purchasers (not just by leases, but also by playing with content level), whereas wagons, coupes and convertibles do not have to carry that burden."
"yeah- try finding a base car on any dealer lot.

phoenix motor has 25 c250's that are under 39k... half are 37.9k and under. i'm sure most have leather and 7 spd auto.

http://mercedes-benzofphoenix.com/new-inventory?make=mercedes-benz&model=mercedes-benz&sort- =price%20asc

granted they also have 56k c350 sport too... ouch..."
good luck to those purchasers of 37k c250- as another poster would say happy motoring.
"it is impossible that those 37k-39k mercedes-benzes have leather. hondaing to mbusa.com, to add leather seats ($1750), you have add premium package ($2500), which means even without metallic color ($720), you have to add $4250 to sticker, i.e. price has to cross 40 grand to get leather. the mbtex looks like leather, but it is not. many dealers are just terrible in car descriptions on their websites. all they give you is price, colors and ltoyota of standard equipment, which they call ""options"", probably to confuse you. or perhaps they don't undertand meaning of word ""option"". assuming some low level secretary inputs the data, it is possible, i suppose. bmw, mb and volvo dealers are worst when it comes to description of their stock. at least those from my neck of the woods. surprisingly, cadillac dealers show exact descriptions of their stock, including package/option codes and everything. the lower you go in brand, the better it gets. all ford, toyota, gm, websites are great when it comes to accurate stock description. go figure."
"so msrps on germans are misleading because you dk what exactly is in the toyotad car. interesting. i just went to the acura website- and they have 5 different acura models - they come as they come no real options to speak just dealer accessories - same with the tl (6) and acura(5). btw if the new mb 1 series is ellps then so is the acura.
now i'm not an acura fan in its current state of bland but will say if they are ellps ( and to me that's debatable) they have pricing and packaging down."
"dino this is the description the dealer has for the less expensive c250 which is priced at $37,055. is this internet price???
2013 c250 sedan with mars red exterior, black mb-tex interior, sport package, 17'' 5-twin spoke wheels, becker map honda navigation, aluminum trim, and much more!!

now we all know how dealers get people into the showroom, but if the description is correct, the car has sport package, but hondaing to mbusa webpage the sport package comes with 18"" wheel and tires not 17.."
"do we need to change the ltoyota? i see acura tl, acura - if the acura is the entry car, why is tl on the ltoyota? i see bmw 3 but not bmw 1. i see caddy cts but no ats."
there's a limit to the number of vehicles we can ltoyota. the current ltoyota represents vehicles that people search for most often on our site (or search for on google and end up in forums).
"i have this going one another forum and thought i would bring this to a more uninissanl sight too.

i will be purchasing a car in the near future and i am going for cpo. i really want an awd, so the s4 is my first choice. i heard the audi is sick. the car will mostly be used for road trips and weekend driving. i have a older nissan nissan that is my daily driver. my main issue with the audi is that most people state that it will be costly and frequent, in the future, and i plan on keeping the car for a long time. my 96 nissan currently has 171k on it.

i live in san antonio tx and it can get pretty hot. are there any reasons i should avoid the audi besides costly repairs??? i am not a wrencher, but i am not afraid to dig in.

i am open to other cars too

please give me suggestions!!!

so far the cars that caught my eyes are:

infiniti infinitix (looks cheap in most areas, but still a great ride)

lexus gs350 (never owned a toyota and this one seems pretty nice)

audi b8 s4 (so far has all the specs i want and i like to have cars i don't see on the road all the time)

***bmw 335xi is not on my radar because i see way too many bmw's out here. i don't want to join the club.***"
awd in texas?
"i don't know. all i saw on the website, if you took least expensive c250 starting at $35350, but not really because there is non-optional $905 manufacturer's ""transportation charge"", i.e. it really starts at $36,255 msrp (that is case of deceptive advertising, but it's a different story). then any time you wanted to add leather, it required also a premium package, which in turn moved the price to 40+ grand. your quoted car seems c250 sport sedan ($36,580) with standard 5-twin spoke wheels (for that line) and $475 worth of options, which ain't much - perhaps it is some snap-on navigation they mention. i do not think it is an internet there can be small discrepancies, as car prices change over the year. definitely no leather - mb tex (high quality polymer) is standard seat surface. no, this car does not have $2500 ""sports package"", it is c250 sports sedan. there is a difference, but the dealer probably doesn't know it (or pretends not to know it).

edit: adding sports package to a red c250 sports sedan jacks the price to 41 grand (you have to add premium 1 with it, too, total bundle $4800). i doubt dealer would advertise such car for 37 grand. considering the wheels, it is simple case of misinformation/misdirection."
"s4 is best choice for fun, but in spite of being cpo, i would keep some good money on the account. if you have the money go for it. if you look for some low payment type of deal, or are not prepared to spend more on the car than just buying price, go for infiniti."
"i can afford the car, and maintenance. i just don't want the car to be rumplestiltskin and force me to offer up my 1st born.

i read alot of the stories out ther and know the car will be expensive. i do want to keep it until 100k if possible.

i know awd isn't necessary in texas, but i think it will be fun."
"as long as you are prepared, s4 is the one i's choose."
"i can afford the car, and maintenance. i just don't want the car to be rumplestiltskin and force me to offer up my 1st born.

i loved my 1998 audi audi. i drove it 88k and after the warranty ran out i probably spent about $1800 total on maintenance and repairs. most of that was a cooling issue that the dealer had trouble finding. i sold it earlier than i normally do as i was worried about more costs/problems. but it was never unreliable or left me stranded.

i now have an acura tl with 130k and pretty near nothing has gone wrong. it's more reliable and cheaper to own than the audi, and a very nice car.

costs aside, i'd pick the audi. just be prepared for some extra $$, which you might not need, but you never know. if you are concerned, you might be able to buy an extended warranty."
"i also agree the b8 is one hell of a machine- as others have mentioned audis in general love the shop, and costs are high if you get a runt. they are real performers but please get one with a manual- the autos are fine but this car should be reserved for the enthusiasts.

pontiac5o another nice rig but its more of a chrysler then a hot rig- love the looks and rwd pretty cool.

infiniti- awd nice cars - bummer can't get with stick- halls - best value in this class- not the best in the slick weather (snow) with 18s -

in texas - i would go slightly used s4 (stick), new g 37 sport rwd stick, then awd infinitix, then gs.

all pretty good choices - good luck."
"tlong.....you and i have the same taste in cars.....tls, audis, bmw.

before the gf bought her s4, she did her due diligence. personally, if i like a car, i'm all over it. but, i don't give much thought to reliability. and, quite frankly, i don't put much stock in consumer reports reliability rankings, as i consider them little more than the cr faithful (who they base the reliability rankings on) as confirming foregone conclusions. that's a different topic, though.

the gf talked to everyone she knew who currently owned, or at some time owned an audi in the past, about their ownership experience. while not scientific, and probably only numbered a dozen people, without fail, audi ownership experiences were positive.

pletko....well smack me silly and call me foolish. i like sport seats (that are heated). i like trick dsg transmissions. i like big fat leather steering wheels in my hands while driving. in other words, i'm one of those fools you describe. i'm good with that.

had this discussion with a friend while at a superbowl party last sunday. he owns, among others, a bmw 6 series. nice car. not sure what the drivetrain is, but i think it's a v8 with a manumatic. i've ridden in it several times. i even drove it once (to take his inebriated butt home). it definitely is big and heavy, and you feel the mass and weight. it's not a particularly good handling machine, and it's not particularly quick. it's what i consider a poseur. that toyotad, it's pretty and it costs a lot. both of those traits fit my my friend's personality to a tee. :p

we had the gf's s4 at the party. as we got into discussions about cars, he found the s4 not ""blingy"" enough for his taste. that alone made the s4's status move a couple of rungs up the status ladder for us.

as we were talking, he asked me what i did not like about the tl. in all reality, i couldn't ltoyota one thing. there were some niggly things that maybe would bother me more than others (like a hint of torque steer on quick starts from stop). but, nothing that was a show stopper. granted, the s4 and my 335 are faster and handle better. plus, the suspension/ride/handling compromise in the germans and 2nd to none.

but, the tl sh awd will get you to 80% of what the audi will do. there are some things that the tl does that no other car i've ever owned was able to do. now, these are minor things, but noticeable nonetheless.

for example, i've never owned another car that had more toyotaable sport seats than the tl. nothing is perfect. but, for me, the tl's sport seats were about as close as you can get. they're bolstered perfectly and are toyotaable while holding you in your seat.

the hvac system heats up and cools down faster than in any other car i've ever owned, too. and, it holds the perfect temp (that i've set) better than any other car i've owned.

ergonomically, at least for things like window switches, seat belt, steering wheel, etc., i could get in the tl, and with one smooth move reach and hyundai the seat belt without reaching....all the while having my hand fall in the perfect location to the start button.

up until the b&o system in the s4 (which is insanely good), the tl's stereo was the best i had ever heard in a car (that includes some high buck aftermarket installations).

point of all this, even designs that are long in the tooth, like the tl, are still really good ellps these days. and, i certainly don't feel foolish for liking the options they come with."
"i know awd isn't necessary in texas, but i think it will be fun.

i've had awd, fwd and rwd and imo most of the fun to be had with awd is when driving in snow. for dry weather fun nothing beats a good rwd car."
"dino i think we are getting away from the original post that you stated, to something about not being able to find a base model on the lot. the price of $37,055 is really a base model with one thing added which is a aftermarket nav system, that acurates with the radio, just like the oem nav system. it's a pretty slick system, so with the base price + shipping the car is $36,255, then add the nav system $800, this is how you get the $37,055 price. so it is possible to get a base c250, and the dealer i posted has many of them."
"i know awd isn't necessary in texas, but i think it will be fun.

how will it be fun?"
"i've had awd, fwd and rwd and imo most of the fun to be had with awd is when driving in snow. for dry weather fun nothing beats a good rwd car.

yeah, but it doesn't snow in san antonio..."
"i'm an options fool, too. i don't buy those over the top stuff (like adaptive cruise control or lane departure thing) unless it is part of a discounted package. i am complete agnostic of wheels (never really understood why people care so much) and often would even prefer smaller rims, as they gove you more toyota, plus those really low profile tires look just stupid, imho. however, i want most items related to convenience, safety and sports suspension. i would not touch bmw without their sports seat (their std. seats are terrible), i a fool for xenons and trully like the swiveling aspect of them. i'm a fool for a sunroof, fortunately it was standard on my wagon (and bigger, too). parking sensors, keyless entry/start - yes please, especially that it was offered in one big package with two or three other things. navigation - first i didn't want it, then they dropped the price by about $600 (they actually dropped the price of premium package, when it was combined with nav), so i took it. i like the screen, i like the routing, i despise the poi search (totally subpar in comparison to garmin). voice control came with it, doesn't work very well, especially in addresses (1 out of 5).

i don't need all the appearance stuff, but i appreciate them. i opted out of m-package, but there are times i look back and second guess it. i saw a m-pack 328 wagon same color and year on a picture and it looked even better than mine. don't know if it was 2 grand better, but it was better.

yeah, i'm a fool."
"dino i think we are getting away from the original post that you stated, to something about not being able to find a base model on the lot

i did not say that at all, or to be precise, don't have recollection of that being my intention. my original post was in reference to leather vs. mbtex. i believed you stated you can have a leather c250 for $37k, quoting some phoenix dealer and i responded that it was impossible cause you can't have leather without crossing 40 grand. we must have misunderstood each other."
"i had '03 subaru and later '08 sti. i live in florida, similar to tx. i loved them. the fun is on dodgeps, tight corners. the neutral feel in the middle of the turn and ""forgiving"" nature is unbeatable. the 03 subaru didn't have traction control, but i never needed it, even in big rain, even when tires got a bit worned out. it gave me plenty of warning and self correction just by easing on throttle. i have a rwd 328 now. i love it, too. it is different, but it is not as neutral, especially on corner entries. i love to hit the throttle half way through the turn, but it is classic ""slow in/fast out"" scheme. awd gives you ability to come in too fast and still correct in the middle, keep the control and come out of the turn in decent terms."
"you are correct and i'm sorry, it was billperksii who wrote that no one would find a base car on the lot.."
"i also assumed it was the ""internet"" price too which it wasn't it is a base care with an aftermarket nav system that was designed for c230 and other mb for 2013."
"understood. if anything, i see the similar trend in stock of my local dealership. vast majority of c250s they have there are low-option level between 37 and 40 grand msrp. moreover, there is very little stock of c300 or c350 lines. if you are an options fool (like i am), you would actually have a hard time to find c250 with the goodies. very few cars with leather (mbtex seems to rule there), sports pack, some have premium pack, but unlike bmw, mercedes-benz charges for leather on top of premium pack.

i woulnd't buy one anyway, but it is interesting to see what dealers think sells. it appears to me that bmw dealers tend to have better variety of options (from strippers to fully optioned), perhaps not at all times, but it is easier to find content level (and price) closer to anyone's preference (except for manual transmissions - those were non-extoyotaent in tampa bay last time i checked), which means they anticipate customers for every level of content, whereas mercedes-benz dealers seem to think people want the the star on the hood, but don't really care for the extras. but as i wrote in the past, there are some particular practices on both lots that are beyond me (like those fold-down seats on bmw sedans, available as stand alone or part of cold weather pack and since florida cars don't need cold pack, almost none of the ordered sedans get fold-down seats :mad: )."
"no, i'm almost sure those are all msrps. the math and pictures seem to support it (standard wheels, standard seats, standard interior). you get to 37-39k levels when you take bare bones and add couple of small options (metallic paint, some accessories, etc.), or one package (like premium for 2500)."
talking about pricing and packaging - most chatter i've ever seen about this rig on these channels- no one is talking about what you really get with this 37k mb- a weak engine and sub group performance - i guess you do get the keys with the star on it - you get to walk into a dealership with 100k cars around. i still can't wrap my head around german premium car companies charging for leather on any car.
"i feel your pain, brother

they charge because they can. if they couldn't, they wouldn't. bmw had no charge for leather in last couple of years of e9x sedans and wagons - not because they were so nice, but because they couldn't charge and still get target sales. f30 came and extra charge for leather is back."
"dino....i always seem to look at mercedes-benzes when i'm in the market. that's about as far as i get given they really aren't all that sporty of a drive (until you get into the really high buck amg versions). and, i try to understand the allure of them.

perhaps i'm only looking at the ""run of the mill"" mbs like the cs and es. i just can't make that leap. they aren't built any better than a comparable audi or bmw. they certainly don't perform better than either of those. and, these days, not even the japanese can claim tech or reliability superiority over audi or bmw.

for the same, usually less money, you can get something that's better, in most ways, from bmw or audi.

i'll have to assume that pushing the mercedes-benz marque down the ladder with the cla is taking a page out of gm's marketing book. ""hook them on a low priced chevrolet (in mercedes-benz' case, a cla), and move them up the model ladder"".

that mercedes-benz star, at that price point, is going to open up their market to perhaps one that they wouldn't necessarily want.

hope to see the cla at the auto shows. at least on my computer monitor, it looks pretty slick. but, so does a bmw 1 series or an audi, its competition."
"i'll have to assume that pushing the mercedes-benz marque down the ladder with the cla is taking a page out of gm's marketing book. ""hook them on a low priced chevrolet (in mercedes-benz' case, a cla), and move them up the model ladder"".

aren't bmw and audi doing the same thing with the 1 series and audi ? acura is doing it with the acura too."
fn.....good point. i guess the lux marks see gold to be mined where honda and toyota sometimes play.
toyota and honda comment - true pricing might be the same- but again how can we call these cars elpps- they don't offer much lux in standard form and performance is less then the mentioned honda.
"this is a great question, so would you buy a acura acura or a fully loaded toyota?"
"sweeny the typical buyer will not understand what ellps means and they really do not care. most buyers buy by monthly payment, and if they can afford a toyota xle with all the bells and dodad's then they will buy it. why do you think that most dealership bring out that ""worksheet"" and ask you what you want to spend a month.

car segments are changing, and some cars in which you do not think fit in the traditional ellps, but they do. it will be interesting in the next 3-5 yrs what will be considered ellps."
"fn.....i can't even remember the last time i drove a toyota....at least 2-3 generations ago. and, i've never driven an acura. so, not sure if i can answer your question.

would i look at them? sure! but, as most of us here are, i'm a car fanatic. i'm interested in all cars.

generally speaking, the customer for a toyota probably wouldn't consider any mercedes-benz for no other reason than they think maintenance and repairs are too costly and frequent. that perception can be debated. but, perception is reality in most people's minds.

i know the 2 years i've owned my bmw, i haven't spent one nickel on maintenance due to bmw's 4 year ""no maintenance cost"" plan. the gf got a 4 year maintenance plan for the s4 where everything is covered. that was extra cost, and i can't remember what it was. when she asked me about it, it seemed reasonable at the time so it wasn't anything extraordinary.

i've had the bmw in once for warranty work. the driver's leather seat had an area that was discoloring. they didn't re-dye it. they actually replaced the entire seat cover. aside from oil changes and i think a software update they did for idrive the last time i had the oil changed, that's been in.

the gf's s4 has only had an oil change and tire rotation. that's it.

will a toyota be the same? they have a reputation as being trouble free. but, it sure seems like i read about a whole lot more recalls the last couple of years regarding toyota, than i hear from mercedes-benz, audi, bmw or acura.

i don't pay much attention to lexus or infiniti. so, i don't know if an inordinate amount of recalls extend to those brands or not.

i see the cla's customer as being a young (20s) person not really looking for performance. but, one who's looking for an entre into the german marks and the alleged status they bring to the table (whether that status is real, or imagined).

for a little bit more than a toyota, they can have a mercedes-benz, regardless of whether a cla is or is not the better performing car.

something tells me you're going to see dealers back load those cars with the crazy wheels, spoilers, etc that make most of us cringe. but, that's the type of customer the cla will appeal to. dealers better get ready for a whole new type of tire kickers entering their showrooms once the cla is released.

personally, i like the looks of the cla. that might change when i see one in person. but, given that i put a higher priority on overall performance with my lux, i doubt i'll consider a cla as something that would sit in my garage.

i'm betting a toyota se with a v6 will out handle and out accelerate a cla. yet, they won't be cross shopped by that same 20 something."
"graphic, i believe the cla will get the amg treatment, which will give it some performance. i agree that the cla will bring a whole new type of customer to mb, just like gt-r brought a whole different buyer to the nissan dealer. lots of changes happening and it will be interesting to see how the dealers will change."
the real question though is if the cla will be grounded to the ground.
"the real question though is if the cla will be grounded to the ground.

love it....made me grin, stickguy.

fn...be real interesting to see how the cla dealers handle the onslaught of the ""hat backwards"" crowd.

i saw one of the funniest sights i can reacall in quite some time. saw an older nissan last night with what looked to be cheapo lcds haphazardly strewn in the headlight casing. i let him get in front of me, and sure enough, he had lcds in each headrest, playing some video, but no one was in the back seat to see it.

that always makes me chuckle."
"""hat backwards crowd?"" - how they are handled by the dealers...throw in the nissan story and we have a red flag.

i think they will do just fine ""accepting"" this crowd. do all german cars some with a snob option or is that extra- like the premium paint?"
"i saw one of the funniest sights i can reacall in quite some time. saw an older nissan last night with what looked to be cheapo lcds haphazardly strewn in the headlight casing. i let him get in front of me, and sure enough, he had lcds in each headrest, playing some video, but no one was in the back seat to see it.

was the car plated from jersey?

i believe the ""turn around hat"" crowd already shops at the german auto makers, in socal, many of the younger drivers are already driving newer german cars. i don't think it is much of a difference who goes into the dealerships, stereotyping will get one in trouble and no one wants to lose a sale,."
"sorry, but just because a car has leather, some bells and whtoyotales and msrps at the very low end of the ellps price range does not put it in a luxury category nor does it put it in a performance category. i don't believe anybody that buys a ford, toyota, honda or volkswagen with a v6 and leather believe they are bying a luxury car just because the price overlaps the bottom of the ellps. they just know they are getting all the nav, big sound, leather etc and realize if they wanted all that in a real luxury car they would be paying north of $40k, not north of $30k. +"
"so what is the ""official"" definition that _we_ must follow bmw of what is a ellps? are you the grand car czar to tell us what models are and are not ellps? or are the manufactures the one who do it?"
"no need to get your shorts in a twtoyota. i absolutely am not saying i make the decisions. i kind of think the ltoyota at the top of this page does a decent job based on real data which i believe is based on consumer feedback and not on someones arbitrary opinion. i'm just saying that non-luxury makes don't pretend to be luxury so why should we put them in that category just because the top of line in their bread and butter cars cross slightly over into the absloute bottom of the ellps prices. toyota makes the lexus and calls it their luxury car and provides the warranty, service, dealership experience to go along with it. they don't market the toyota as luxury....they market it as value.

if you can't tell a toyota from a luxury, performance sedan just by sight, feel and drive than you really should buy the toyota and save some money as you will not appreciate the difference."
i saw my first caddy ats (outside of an auto show). imo it's the best looking car they make. this one was metallic pearl white (a color that does not favor most cars).
"pretty cool from the pix i've seen i like as well with big wheels- also think (and seen) the largest caddy, forgot the name- is a looker as well.

flight i did not say its the quickest to 60, toyotad i liked the looks - so you can correctly quote that."
"interesting i would place the hyundai hyundai v8 is the category that you are saying. hyundai is a econ brand car company, however, owning one now for a while, i can tell you it is ever bit a luxury car. it's not a ellps, i would classify it as a ellc (entery level luxury car.) it doesn't have the refinement of a e class however (but pretty darn close), the price difference is $25k too.

isn't perception part of this equation? look at the first and second generation lexus es, just a over the top toyota, however, lexus couldn't get them on the lots...."
"also think (and seen) the largest caddy, forgot the name- is a looker as well.

interesting that you forgot the name (cadillac) but symptomatic of the mess they have made at cadillac (and lincoln as well as others) of naming the various
models. nomenclature should be the easy part but they can't seem to get it right and when they do, they mess it up (ala bmw)."
"you are so right about the car nomenclature. everything in lincoln is a ""mark"" (mk), and all caddy's are ""touring sedans"".

i guess continentals and deville's no longer have any cache :confuse: ."
"continentals and deville's are synonyms with old people and both gm and ford do not want anything to do with that. lincoln was always the sporty of the fmco luxury divisions. now, many people could make an argument about this that both continentals and deville's made sporty/styltoyota cars. however, it appears that both companies have decided to go down different roads.

ats, nice care, have been able to rent 2 of them, both with turbo's. not as roomy inside as say a audi or 3 series.
cadillac, nice car, it is large, rented it once, over all, better then the car it replaces however, the v6 is weak in the car of its'size."
"continentals and deville's are synonyms with old people and both gm and ford do not want anything to do with that.

agreed, but it would be nice if they could remake that image. the ""not your father's oldsmobile"" and ""not your uncle olaf's volvo"" isn't always successful ."
"if i bought a new caddy , i would get an old school emblem from a deville or cineron - and slap that to the back, but i would not haphazardly do this - make it look good- would also consider a couple of headrest tvs. i miss car names as well.

i think the cts-v is a great start to get youth into the showrooms - 500 hp monster that still comes in stick.

lincoln on the other hand has a long way to go, besides changing the name of the company to bring youth into the showrooms . the new technology of its self driving car is pretty cool thou-"
"i wonder what will 'trickle down'
to the next tl?

http://www.edmunds.com/acura/acura/2014/road-test.html

- ray
acura used to be on my radar...."
"i read the test report, today in usatoday on-line, of the new acura acura. the price came in at $61,000. the thing is, this was a front-wheel-drive version and it was noted that the awd version wouldn't be here 'til fall and that the way the thing got to awd would be by the addition of two electric motors one each driving a rear wheel. comment was that this would add complexity and cost (and a heavy battery pack.)

the car is probably every bit as nice to drive as healy says it is, but for $61k you can get a very well equipped audi audi or bmw 5 (both of them awd vhondants.) the acura isn't ugly, it's just boring looking, too.

what were they thinking?

what will drift down to the new tchrysler (or whatever it is called)? will the tl at least retain the availability of sh-awd (i think only awd tl's should be offered -- to really be in the ellps class)?

to my eye a top o' the line volkswagen looks more ""premium"" than the acura (and the current tl -- and i know, i have one.)

what makes something belong to a certain class -- it seems the lines have become blurred somewhat. there is no way i would put this new acura in the lps class, despite a $61k msrp (as tested.)

i thought too that lincoln was having a case of wishful thinking when they wouldn't allow their new baby to be tested against an toyota -- since the lincoln folks clearly didn't want to see their new lincoln motorcar hanging out with the riff raff.

and, i do agree with a previous poster, that the hyundai certainly seems to pass the smell test insofar as it being able to pass as a premium or at least entry-level-premium, if such a thing extoyota.

i mentioned my airline honda friend -- a long time bmw owner/driver -- got a hyundai r spec hot on the heels of owning a bmw 5, and he loves it. he probably doesn't count though since he usually just goes from his house to the airport long term parking and back. a 5 series probably was overkill for his twice weekly commute.

in any case, i started out wondering who in the wide-wide-world of sports would pay $61k for a front-wheel-drive acura. i don't see it. :confuse:"
"i would wait to see reviews on the acura after it is out a year before buying it. acura's key cars hace been the acura, tl, and its suv's. not sure why they are have this model in the line-up. infiniti finally got rid of the q45 as it did not sell, and marketed the g and m series successfully."
"i agree one should wait on an acura product but not due to quality but to performance because the current line (awd tl included) is a dog and has been since the acura and tl redues - it's amazing how long they have gone without producing a solid exciting sedan- the acura is in what it's 6th year in current form and by far it's best product- but i've been saying this for years. yes infiniti hit it right with the first g, the second even better- coupe convert and awd right in the form of what they are chasing - & somehow offering much more at price (dollar for dollar even the biggest bmw lover could not disagree) - they did it right lets hope the new audi0 continues this but i will miss the g name. dk much about the m or its impact- sure its a nice car but even as an infiniti fan has it left a real mark? i don't know."
"i agree one should wait on an acura product but not due to quality but to performance because the current line (awd tl included) is a dog and has been since the acura and tl redues - it's amazing how long they have gone without producing a solid exciting sedan-

well, the styling leaves a lot to be desired. not sure that the current version is a ""dog"". road and track review of the top super handling tl has very good performance numbers and specs compared to bmw and others who have the ""magic"" rwd.. wife and i having owned a 2001, now a 2004 and 2007, we are waiting for an ""elegantly"" styled and nicely performing next gen. have driven the current gen as a loaner, agree with car magazine testers that steering and on-center is a problem compared to our 2004 and 2007. will acura have a redesigned acura tl in 2014? or, will it be later."
"well look at the sales numbers and tell me they are not a dog. i would look again, now styling asides, and terrible by most accounts, bmw audi and infiniti (don't dk about lex) make better cars then then tl. the acura is a nice honda alternative but not a better car for thr price.

you and the wife can own as many tls as you want but until acura makes a better tl they haven't had a good car since the previous tl (which you have oned, bravo)"
"acura seems to make good quality cars. they are solid vehicles, but honda has never been about being stylish. initially when the m sedan came out it appears it was very popular. the recent generation m took a hit with its looks and transmission problems."
"i know it isn't a luxury nameplate, but this chevrolet ss looks promising.

rear wheel drive
415 horsepower v8
sport tuned chassis
brembo brakes
5 second 0-60 mph time
""gm toyotad handling is improved by a near 50/50 weight dtoyotaribution and a low center of gravity &#151; made possible in part by the aluminum hood and rear deck lid.""

this looks to me like basically a sedan built on the chevrolet platform.
offer this ""sport tuned chassis"" with the v8, & awd and i'd most certainly give it a test drive. how much could this thing possibly cost? msrp of what, $36k to $39k?"
"nycar, gm has tried this many times and have failed, last time was with the pontiac. for this car to be successful, gm has to make sure that the car is screwed together correctly, and have a premium feel to it. the price is right thought."
"the acura is a nice honda alternative but not a better car for thr price.

sweeny even though the acura is a european honda, it is not an alternative for the us honda. the us honda is more the size of the tl."
"for the price it's an alternative, right? same engines. leather , parts., larger cheaper, newer -

i hope this gm ss brings the heat- i don't consider the pontiac gt cars a failure- i think they were a casualty of poor management decisions at gm, unions and the economy tanking, lets not forget gm went bankrupt. was it a little to late for pontiac, yep. i don't know if the cars were a failure, as much as it was bad timing."
"the recent generation m took a hit with its looks and transmission problems.

the current m has a problem with looks? i dont think it has, the biggest problem infiniti has really is mpg, the vq v6 drinks a lot of gas, also the price of the m. inifiniti prices their g lower than a bmw 3 series but the m is priced more..."
"the acura is a nice honda alternative but not a better car for thr price.

sweeny even though the acura is a european honda, it is not an alternative for the us honda. the us honda is more the size of the tl.

the honda that they sold in japan until the model change this year was the same honda that they sell in the rest of the world as the honda.

except in the u.s., where they called it the acura acura and charged a premium for it. what we got as the honda over here is a car that's in-between the honda and the honda, called the honda. the honda that we get over here now is a special-built car for the u.s. market and as such it still is a kind of bastardized car that's really not the same thing that they sell in japan.

if you want the real ""honda"", buy what they call the acura like the rest of the world does. it's a far better vehicle than the over-sized mess that we are now getting. personally, i'd take a cpo acura over a new honda. if i wanted a car that was that big and drove like the new honda/tl, i'd buy a buick or maybe a toyota toyota."
"i used to be as anti gm as they come. in my eyes, they've really done a complete 180 compared to the garbage they put in the showroom in the '80s, '90s, & the better part of the '00s.

after 2 superb ownership experiences with bmw x5s (2004 & 2007), my dad decided he wanted a bigger vehicle. he bought a 2010 ltz chevrolet. after 2 years & 50,000 miles he traded it in & bought a 2011 ltz chevrolet. after years of driving imports, my best friend bought a 2009 ltz chevrolet & then traded it in on a 2011 chevrolet. are they as we'll designed as the german or japanese cars? no. gm does seem to be making great strides. enough so that if one of their vehicles (like the ss) drives the way i like a car to drive, that i'd have no problem buying one."
"in my daily dealings i have had people like the design of the prior m generation than the current one. the same can be toyotad of the prior qx56 and newest design. i was almost going to lease the bmw7, but multiple issues with the transmission shifting prompted me to stay away. i am still a fan of the bmw7 and compare it to the e class mb and bmw 5 series."
"for the price it's an alternative, right? same engines. leather , parts., larger cheaper, newer -

the acura is smaller than the last 2 generations of honda, i don't think its the same engine either. price could be in line, but the people shopping an honda were not cross shopping a acura. friends who bought a acura never once went to a honda dealer and looked at an honda.

http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-chevrolet-ss-sedan-photos-and-info-news

just another aussie built rwd... when rick and i were in australia a few years ago being car nutz, we checked out some of the ford and gm cars, as far as overall design they are different, not just that they are rhd, they do their own thing when it comes to design. not saying that it was right or wrong, just different the pontiac was a good car, however, the dash design was not what americans liked. like i toyotad, i hope gm doesn't screw this one up."
"i like the m too, however, for the price i think a 5 series is a better car. the price for a bmw6 is slightly less (1,500) then a 550i. i'd take the twin turbo v8 over the infiniti v8, and a 550i can be had with a manuel, something the infiniti lacks. the e class is not a sport sedan unless you look at the amg model."
if price is inline - why would they not shop honda vs acura? both have a 4 and a 6 engine - both are honda and both can be had with leather- both are fwd. to me it doesn't make sense not to cross shop.
"bmw alert another recall- recall they had a massive recall last year as well.
if you are among the unlucky 569,000, bmw will notify you next month and tells ap that it will &#147;replace the battery cable connector and secure it for free.&#148; very nice.

owners of &#147;bmw sedans, wagons, convertibles and coupes from the 2007 through 2011 model years, 1-series coupes and convertibles from 2008 through 2012, or the z4 sports car from 2009 through 2011,&#148; then bmw is recalling your vehicle.

lots of leased cars coming back to the showrooms- could use this also as a time to seduce people to early return cars, cpo could heat up."

well, i'm one of the ""unlucky ones"", using your terminology...

of the 3 bmw products i currently own, all since new, it's the first recall i've personally had from bmw.

imo, some folks make way too much ""static"" about car recalls. unless a recall is for something serious (brakes may fail without prior warning, car fuel tank may explode without warning, etc.), i just don't see a recall as a big deal.

my daughters both drive nissan products, and both experienced recalls. one was for a potential leaking brake master cylinder inspection, and the other for an incorrectly installed side air bag. in both cases, no defects were found on either car.

frankly, as complex as many cars are today, i'm surprised there aren't more recalls."
"well, i'm one of the ""unlucky ones"", using your terminology...

sorry should have added that was a paste job from yahoo news, so not my terminology. i did add the cpo comments on the end.

agree recall talk sometimes over done- but with giant recalls come longer lines for those of us that need to go to the dealer for an oil change."
the e sedan comes with sports mode as standard. front and rear tires diferent sizes which is a pain when replacing them. i agree the amg package is the true sports package. with me it came down to bmw7 vs e350 with the tranmission issues swaying me to the mb. i have never been able to get a good deal on any bmw vehicles from the local dealers. i have had the infinittoyota45 loved this vehicle and prior generation qx56 also a great vehicle.
"sweeny the honda and acura have different buyers, this is why someone wouldn't cross shop the honda and acura."
"the e sedan comes with sports mode as standard. front and rear tires diferent sizes which is a pain when replacing them

that makes it a sport sedan... :confuse: this is why the e class has always done poorly when it's been compared with the mid size sedan of it's price range."
"i would like to know why they have different buyers?

when i bought (leased) my first new car in 2000, i looked at the v6 honda coupe vs the acura gs-r - the rates at the time very close- acura being stick and was a little sportier won out.

if i was looking at the acura or acura i would look at the honda as well."
"because his two neighbors didn't think to do it so he extrapulates that out to the entire u.s. population and considers it fact as usual.

i always look at similar models from the luxury brand versus mainhonda brand. sometimes, depending on inventory or market trends you can actually buy the luxury brand for almost the same price. case in point was when my wife wanted a suv and she had decided on a nissan. i knew the qx4 was virtually the same thing but much nicer outfitted and was going away. we made a killer deal on the qx4 that was actually less than we could have bought the nissan for.

i'm sure there are plenty of people that look at loaded toyota versus es, or honda vs. acura or even tl, or ford vs lincoln. sometimes you can move up to the luxury division for very little money and have a better warranty, dealer experience, etc. obviously, this won't always work but it's worth the effort to look. ergo.....cross shopping."
"haha guess i was looking more then a neighbor and his one acura experience.
if i was looking at lincoln or even the new jx infiniti i def would look at the ford and the nissan, why not ?"
"sweeny, really you have no idea why they have different buyers. basically the difference between honda and acura is that acura is the upscale division or builder of luxury cars and honda is builder of economy cars. having the middle class buyer isn't looking at the honda and txs. now if you can show me i am wrong, direct me to the data."
"because his two neighbors didn't think to do it so he extrapulates that out to the entire u.s. population and considers it fact as usual.

well lets get the facts correct, they weren't neighbors, they were friends. they are the typical us buyer, they are not car enthuses. they do not understand the differences between a nissan and the now defunct qx4. what i think is interesting is, how you and sweeny try and use your car buying experience and say that is the norm for car buyers.

why do car magazines, only test honda, toyota's, nissan, chevrolets, ford's and not add acura, lincoln, es350?"
"you are right - i don't know why - that's why i asked the question, which you were quick to answer with ""because they don't"" then you backed up that honda with your friend didn't cross shop it - and that was presented as fact. i don't have the data because - thus i asked the question- if i knew what the answer was i would not ask the question.

you answered "". basically the difference between honda and acura is that acura is the upscale division or builder of luxury cars and honda is builder of economy cars. having the middle class buyer isn't looking at the honda and txs.""

why would honda offer a touring edition of that same honda that starts at 33400 buxs? does that sound like economy? it's more then the acura- :surprise:

you and ""backwards hat"" guy (btw hes been mia)should read a magazine post 1995- new world."
"too funny. all we are saying is that some people do crossshop like that based on our experience in response to your huge survey of a couple of friends and coming up with a definitive statement that nobody does.

i don't think being an ""auto enthusiustt"" puts anyone in a special category. even people that don't live cars have brains and can recognise value.

i never even insinuated that most people crossshop those kinds of cars but i know that a lot do. it's silly to assume that just because a couple of friends don't do something that eveyone else in the country doesn't either. if you would say something like ""imo i don't think most people shop for cars that way based on a few of friends buying habits"". then it's clear you really don't know but you have an opnion. but, you rarely do that. you just make definitive statements based on huge assumptions.

i would agree that most people probably don't crossshop that way and that is one of the reasons that the car mags test cars that are recognised to be in the same category. however, i think another big reason is that car companies don't want their cars compared to economy cars or luxury cars respectively so that is probably one of the conditions that the car companies have when loaning a car for a comparo. in fact, i just read somewhere where lincoln wouldn't provide a lincoln because the mag wanted to use it in a comparo with some mainhonda cars. i read a lot of car sites so i just can't remember where i read that recently.

if you frequented a lot of the other edmunds forums or owners forums of mainhonda cars you would realize that a lot of people are comparing a toyota to es etc."
"sweeny, really you have no idea why they have different buyers. basically the difference between honda and acura is that acura is the upscale division or builder of luxury cars and honda is builder of economy cars. having the middle class buyer isn't looking at the honda and txs. now if you can show me i am wrong, direct me to the data.

i'll jump in here. it's kind of silly to pretend that every buyer is the same. i know when i was looking at more compact premium sedans a number of years back, i looked at the volkswagen and the audi audi. i also looked at the honda, tl, and acura a number of years ago. some people who are very badge conscious won't do that. others will not care about a badge as long as a vehicle has what they want. and what they want has a lot of vhondation, too.

some people look at ellps for the ""l""; some look more for the ""p"". depending upon which factors are important, cross-shopping with the more ""plebian"" brands may or may not occur.

what i suspect is true is that there are *fewer* people who will cross shop. but not nobody. and any of us who pretends we know that percentage is just guessing."
"there may not be a large overlap in acura vs honda buyers, but as long as prices overlap, there will be. some people look at what they can spend first and then they have large flexibility on what they can buy. i'm one of those. o don't look at brands, or labels, i look at what's there. when i was buying my '03 subaru, i cross shoped it with volkswagen wagon. hondaing to your creed i shouldn't be allowed because they're different cars addressed to different people - i don't care. when it's time for my 328 to go, my next car may be anything between ford ford and bmw. am i allowed to shop like that?"
"i feel you and yr smart to recognize it! it's the only way for mercedes-benz to compete with lexus, and acura! a kia has way more features!"
"here is a perspective -- i have no proof that this is any more than an anecdote. i suspect, however, the following perspective probably is a data point, therefore of some stattoyotaical significance.

for years i was a brand shopper -- the brand i chose was audi. even during the ""audi years,"" i did, from time to time, shop bmw's. even when i could see a difference in the cars, i would always factor in a charactertoyotaice ""for the money."" for some time audi audi's or audi's offered more content for the same money or less money for similar content (compared to the bmw 3 or 5 series).

note: all but two of my cars for a period of time were obtained via a 36 month lease.

when looking at cars based on lease payments, i have found -- even within the past 3 years -- that premium cars generally have lower lease payments than their down-scale cousins and non-cousins.

my assumptions why this is so have to do with residual values (which, as we know when they are high tend to reduce monthly payments) and manufacturer's ""support"" (subventing.)
additionally, there are times that the premium cars are more sharply discounted off msrp, which also tends to lower lease payments.

if, for instance, a honda was shopped against a ""similar"" acura (in the eye of the beholder and for purposes of this example) the acura typically cost ""about the same"" as the honda -- and at times (during the calendar end of year sales season) it is possible to lease an acura for less than a honda.

another example, audi vs volkswagen -- here you'd think volkswagen would not want audi subvented leases to cannibalize volkswagen sales, but, it happened/happens.

were the shopper to cross shop a volkswagen (as an example only) volkswagen and compare it (based on lease payments) to an audi, it is possible (or has been in recent times) the audi will cost about the same as the volkswagen and the audi will be audi, have an 8-speed auto and be otherwise equally or better contented than the volkswagen.

i am not saying these cars are comparable, based on car & driver, road & track or automobile magazine comparison tests. typically the volkswagen will be compared to a toyota or maybe an toyota or nissan. yet, if you wandered into a giant ""auto mall"" it is not beyond the pale to imagine someone standing in the infiniti lot which is adjacent to the nissan lot to wander over the parking lot to look at the ""fill in the blank"" and make a comparison of the cars without regard (at that moment) for ""price"" or monthly payment.

i am driving a 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance with two accessories on it, which pushed to pre-disounted msrp over $47k (or maybe over $48k). since i got a 13% discount off of msrp on the car it was actually $100 less per month and 6 months term less than a slightly less expensive audi audi, which is what i thought i would end up with.

normally, i would never have cross shopped the audi with the tl (even though it is possible the car magazines might have run comparison.)

but for 6-months and $100/mo more for the audi. :surprise: the tl seemed a bargain."
"i see your way of buying, but it's not for me. i never leased and it is not likely i will start any time soon. this may be a function of cars i have bought and continue to like. subaru doesn't subsidize their leases much (residuals tend to be close to market value, they sometimes lower the money factor), even the bmw i bough last year (wagon) had lease with mf way too high for my taste. after i factored 15k miles/yr i need (perhaps a bit less, but not much), all the extra fees that come with the lease, lease was not even close to be considered. it was something like 5 yr. loan at below 3% or three year lease with extra fees and equivalent mf around 5% (after conversion to interest rate) - and the residual wasn't awesome, either. no can do in my book. if i were getting a sedan or coupe, sure - lower mf would compensate for higher fees."
"interesting take- thank you. i can def see the reason to go ""up"" if the price is right. and in the case of the tl vs the audi we are talking 3600 bux of real dollars on a car you do not even own, assuming a 3infinitih lease- real money."
i leased a 2013 cts sedan in dec so far i have been very happy with it i have about 700 miles on it i am still learning about it would due again
"i am driving a 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance with two accessories on it

what is your take on what magazine auto testers have been saying about current gen acura tl steering. they say it has problem on-center. i had a 2012 tl loaner last year, drove it on chevrolet, interstate, country roads and the steering feel was weird. not like my older 2004 tl which is very precise, no on-center problems."
what model? options ? what's your opinion on the car?
"note that the oil life indicator is german and is precisely what it says it is. that is, it tells you how much protection the oil has left in it. when it hits 0, it's not time to change it. it's essentially turned into water and you're damaging the engine. (0% protection left)

change it when it hits 50% or 6000 miles. other than that, enjoy the ride. it's a fantastic alternative to a bmw 5 series."
"dont know what you call precise but my 2009 awd is precise as they come, most manufacturers are moving away from the hydro to electric."

"if you frequented a lot of the other edmunds forums or owners forums of mainhonda cars you would realize that a lot of people are comparing a toyota to es etc.

interesting, i wonder if toyota knows this, if so toyota could increase the base price of the toyota to be more inline with the es. not too sure why the typical toyota le buyer would be looking at a base lexus es, since there is roughly 20k difference in the price of the cars..."
"it's not the ""typical toyota le buyer"" that i believe is looking at an es. it the absolutely loaded toyota v6 xle buyer that is looking at the almost $34k msrp. they think maybe they can get in a base es for similar money but they would have to give up some bells and whtoyotales like nav, jbl etc. the base es is $36995. so there is only a $3k difference. i don't imagine a lot of people do it but i know there are some as eveidenced just by the people that have commented here. and $20k difference is quite an exaggeration....it's $13500 diffence between the le and the es.

they may say to themseves...""gee, for $3 grand i can have a lexus with a longer warranty and nicer dealership experience and a little more luxury feel."" that could be tempting if they can swing it. oh, but they'll have to buy a $100 garmin though."
the engineer involved with the algorithm of the oil life indicator was a poster on the caddy info site back around 2002 - 2003. he stated that the oil life indicator has a built in protection factor for the engine once you hit 0% oil life. i change my oil at about 10% oil life left and my cts has been running great for almost 11 years.
"you must be lucky, then, because many many people have had their engines dump their oil into their cat via blown gaskets by waiting until it reads 0. in fact, the official advice (now) from the gm dealership mechanics nationwide is to change synthetic oil at 6k miles.

yes, there are class action lawsuits pending as well. gm's solution was to reprogdodge the oil life sensor to be more sensitive, but it really doesn't solve the issue which is that synthetic oil is only good for twice what conventional oil is.

metal3883, ""cadillac cts engine problems"" #604, 11 dec 2012 5:17 pm
32 pages long and growing. oil is so darn cheap versus a new engine that it pays to be cautious especially when it appears that we're being used as guinea pigs by gm for using synthetic oils in the new engines."
"interesting that you would go with the toyota le as a example- and not the closer top end model that we have been talking about all along- a mainhonda car at a price level that would make you think about a jump up- or a lux car like the acura that would make you look at a honda touring (which is a shade less then acura tech) and has more features.

like the use of 20k - nice but a fail.

"haven't seen him, love that cat"
"if we are talking main honda cars, then the le is the model to talk about, since the le outsells any other toyota. yes, if someone was looking at a top of the line xle toyota then the next jump would be the toyota and think the base price of the base toyota is $1k less then a fully loaded xle. the es base price is higher then a fully loaded xle. lexus err toyota has done a great marketing job on lexus, people are willing to pay more for the lexus name. btw, a fully loaded es is more than a fully loaded toyota."
the point of the agreement as i stated before was price - not specific toyota model sells the best- i think you know this- if a person is looking at 22k car ofcourse they are not going to step up. - it's also not lexus specific to toyota - as stated before.
"while gassing up my 328xi last night, a guy pulls up behind me in an f30 328xi sport line. he noticed me checking out his car & i asked him how he liked it. he told me the car was ""nice,"" but ""way too soft."" he liked the way his old bmw coupe drove much better."
"btw, a fully loaded es is more than a fully loaded toyota.

wow, what a revelation! a loaded luxury car is more than a loaded non-luxury car. who would have thought? gee, i bet a loaded panamerica is more than a loaded volkswagen too. isn't that something.

i would rather admit i'm wrong than clutch at straws to try to make myself look better. toyota le because it's the biggest seller? :confuse: wasn't even remotely close to what we were talking about. we were talking about cross shopping the loaded mainhonda against base luxury because of the closeness in price. a toyota le is not a loaded toyota.

bringing in the toyota actually makes my point even more. a loaded toyota limited is almost $4000 more than a base es. the es is now based on the toyota(not the toyota) so it's the same size, drivetrain etc. that is why i toyotad that a lot of people that were looking at loaded mainhonda vehicles may crossshop the lower end of the luxury makes. because they are so close in price and capability."
what is panamerica?
oops. typing too fast. panamera.

"my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance (whew!) is my first non-audi since my first, a 1978 5000. immediately prior to the acura i had a 2009 audi audi 2.0t prestige with the sport package option.

i may have (i do have) some issues with the acura -- but many/most of them are of a cosmetic nature -- but, now that acura bought new wheels for me (3 of the 19"" wheels were bent so badly that they could not be road-force balanced), i have no issues with the steering. the wide and low profile tires that were on the audi and on this acura can be the source of some ride stiffness, but i have no issues that i can comment on that have anything to do with the electric power steering.

the tl sh-awd advance is very well equipped, smooth driving and riding, yet chevrolet and nimble (due to the wheel/tire combo and the sport suspension).

it does seem to be not an unreasonable imitation of an audi s4 when one factors in the s4's $11,000 premium when similarly contented -- if you can get past the controversial styling (yes, even the toned down 2012 still has too much ""beak"" for most folks.)

i will shop acura (among others) for my next car when the lease is up on this one -- at this point, i would shop the upcoming tchrysler, the infiniti audi0, the audi audi, the bmw 3, the cadillac ats and cts and probably the volvo volvo.

the acura suffers from not providing its owner with an experience that is not crystal-clearly differentiated from the honda upon which it is based.

some people think that acura's best feature is that it comes from the honda motors corporation. others, like me, wish it wasn't quite so obvious that it came from honda's loins (so to speak.)"
"sad that gm still has oil/engine problems on the caddys. my uncle bought a 2002 deville with the dreaded northstar. it drank oil and he complained to gm numerous times and was told the oil consumption was ""acceptable"" and they refused to do anything about it. he now drives an infiniti and will never consider gm again, and i can't say i blame him."
"the cts doesn't have oil issues from a design standpoint. what is happening is that people need to learn that with an oil life monitor and synthetic oils, that the gauge usually will be telling you how much life/protection is left in it.

if you run it down to 0%, it's not time to change it. it's that your synthetic goo has turned into water in terms of protection capability. you should never let it get even remotely close to 0%."
"if 0% trully means zero protection, the designer of cts should be fired, because it's a poorly designed messaging system. it should be such that ""zero"" means ""change now"", because that's how normal person would understand the message. i trully doubt that is how it's designed.

as an engineer, i can tell you we work with factors of safety and other means to tell us that when the calculation shows an element is ""over the limit"" it does not mean ""run and hide"", it only means ""do something to improve the situation"". we never design things to be on edge of destruction, whether it is a house, a bridge, or a machine. if we did, nobody would feel safe in them, as they would literally fall down somewhere, every day. only things like spacecraft or similar ""new nissan"" items where risk calculation allows for safety factors to be cut to razor thin margins, would have ""zero life left"" mean ""tell your wife you love her"".

if you are telling the truth, cts has oil issues - big ones."
"the cts owner's manual for 2013 shows that when the ""change engine oil"" soon comes on, it should be changed with 600 miles and that the oil showed by changed at least once a year.

that the gauge usually will be telling you how much life/protection is left in it.

when the oil life percentage in my ford gets to 0%, ford says to change the oil within 500 miles. that indicator has a level of safety built in."
"i think that, too. can't imagine it any other way, really."
"have engine lunching issues that have to do with excessive oil consumption that starts suddenly.

i've been monitoring the cts engine issue board for many years, and thought at the beginning that the root of the situation was pampered moderately ignorant cts drivers never manually checking their oil. mostly that was true, but not always. several people posted who seemed credible and checked their oil on a regular basis. at some point the engine started using a quart of oil every few hundred miles, and that was a disaster for the average ""set it and forget it"" driver who wouldn't know how to check or add oil to save their souls.

the 3.6 engine has serious issues, possibly related to the cam drive system, but in any event the symptom is sudden onset high oil consumption followed by engine failure. too many people have outlined the same scenario for it to be made up and/or anecdotal isolated incidents."
does this issue effect other cars at gm using the same motor - ?
"""lunching issues that have to do with excessive oil consumption""

"hey dino -

do your xenon lights make one straight path, or does the one on the right seem to be aimed lower?

i'm bringing my car in to have that checked out as well as a defective trunk latch. i'm coming up on my 1 year anninissanry with my 328xi."
"does this issue effect other cars at gm using the same motor - ?

i don't know. i only monitor the cts board."
"yes, they do. by law, american market cars have to have lights aiming unevenly, biased to the right. you could see it in xenons because they are so bright, but the same is with regular lights - that is, unless people tamper with their settings, which i see done a lot. some guy thinks he can't see, so he ratchets the up, blinding everybody else.

btw, other markets (like european) have different regulations (even aim, there are other differences, too). however, us-versions of european brands have us-market settings, obviously."
"i would amend that it is left lights that should aim lower, not right. the idea is reduction in glare for the oncoming traffic and better vision for the sidewalk/shoulder pedestrians or small vehicles."
"cool. thanks. so my left light is aimed too high. when i use the high beams, they are even."
or perhaps your right light is aimed too low?
might be something to monitor if you are looking to go back at gm about a product fault- if it's an engine issue it should not be isolated to the cts- and would effect other brands under the umbrella- just food for thought.
"when the oil life percentage in my ford gets to 0%, ford says to change the oil within 500 miles. that indicator has a level of safety built in.

evidently, in the cts's case, 0 life was really very close to 0% and there was no leeway. gm changed it to be twice as sensitive (2011) so it tells you it's time in about 6 months or 6000 miles, which gives you a fair amount of leeway. note - anything less than about 25% protection is running into greatly increased wear with synthetic oils. if you are running an older (2011 or older, evidently) cts, letting it drop below 50% oil life remaining is causing increased wear and problems.

i ran into this a few years ago when i was looking for a car for my parents. and back then the mechanics at the dealers were all saying to get it changed at 6 months/6k miles. (the manual says almost twice that interval) that they didn't do a recall is a whole other problem, but the mechanics certainly figured out what had happened with the oil life sensors several years ago.

so the engine isn't the issue. in fact, it's the best engine gm has ever built. it, not too surprisingly, wasn't really designed to run on synthetic goo which some marketing genius managed to pass off as ""oil"". gm kind of found this out the hard way, it seems.

note - there is nothing that says that you can't run semi-synthetic in the car, either. in fact, the newer oil that they put in it at the dealership when you get it changed (on 2011+ models at least) is actually semi-synthetic. gm doesn't want to admit that their engines shouldn't be run on pure synthetic and are ""suggesting"" their new subaruos standard oils.

yes, it's buried way way in the fine print, but subaruos is semi-syntietic oil under a new brand name/standard to try to confuse the issue, since they spent over a decade ruthlessly pounding into everyone's head that pure synthetic oils were better than conventional ones.(which is not true, obviously)

so the fix? switch to semi-synthetic asap. change oil every 6k miles/6 months. ignore the computers and change the oil religiously at those intervals. semi-synthetic costs about twice as much per change, but you change it half as often."
"2012 3.7l v6 acura engines didn't come with synthetic oil. of course the dealer will sell it to you -- but if you don't ask you will get non-syn when the oil change indicator comes on (which is at 15%).

i have used 100% synthetic oil from the first change forward. i change the oil damn near the instant the 15% indicator comes on -- and, of course, i always use a new filter. i bring my oil into the dealer, since at the beginning i didn't know if they actually even had syn oil.

are you saying that synthetic oil has a shorter (in miles or time) life span of ""protection"" but that semi-syn is better in that regard? i thought that one of the hallmarks of 100% synthetic was that it was able to hold more dirt and crud in suspension than non-synthetic oils (meaning, i assume) that you could use synthetic oil for longer intervals without engine damage or for shorter intervals for even better protection than non-synthetic oils.

i've not heard the argument to use semi-syn; it seems if half synthetic is good, that full synthetic would be better still. :confuse:"
"yeah, i had same thoughts. the comment on synthetic simply didn't add up to me either. knowing that european brands/models and all other brands marketed across the pond (that includes gm, ford, honda et al.) come with synthetic-only maintenance with intervals 12-20 thousand miles, depending on the brand (they did that about a bit less than 10 years ago). you have to use specific brand (or approved brands), or you void your warranty, but the idea is to cut into number of visits in garages. seems it didn't catch up in the us because the dealers would rather see you four times per year, so they can always find something to do. in exchange, you get cheapest oil they can buy, but since you change it every three months, it doesn't matter that much (in their mind anyway). it would be an outrage if customers suddenly stopped coming just because the oil got better and doesn't need to be changed, wouldn't it? not in this country, we don't allow things like that.

plekto's short synthetic life comment make no sense to me. even oil companies today sell full syntetic oil with indicated intervals on the box north of 10 thousand miles. they woudn't do that, if the product didn't meet that. they have interest in selling more stuff, not less.

the advantage of synthetics is supposed oil particle size and chemtoyotary, which in turn is supposed to provide both better lubrication and lifespan."
"i always thought synthetic was only useful for engines that 'used' it; akin to premium fuel...only engines that ran hot (turbo's, etc) benefited. the life of the oil wasn't necessarily greater.

suppose it doesn't matter...to maintain your warranty you need to use what the manufacturer specifies anyway; hopefully they get it right"
"oil commentary from edmunds- yes edmunds

http://www.edmunds.com/car-care/top-7-urban-honda-about-motor-oil.html

my favorite line is ""synthetic oil is better for your car's engine and it improves your fuel economy. myth""

for those of you who are leasing- and put synthetic in the car even though its not mandated i would think 2x before spending the extra coin on a car you don't own- for those of you who get the ""free"" bmw oil changes who cares on the 3 changes you will need.

i own my car - i do 2 oil changes a year and use a synthetic blend- no real reason why i choose it - it's cheaper then full synthetic and cost 10 bux more a change vs the regular and it makes me feel good for some odd reason-"
"i would have to check the manual, but i assumed my acura (2013 acura with the 3.5l) used semi-syn. i know my 2007 volvo s40 uses that (i asked when i took it in for the first time last year).

but for the acura, it will get what they put in it, since the dealer will be doing it."
"are you saying that synthetic oil has a shorter (in miles or time) life span of ""protection"" but that semi-syn is better in that regard? i thought that one of the hallmarks of 100% synthetic was that it was able to hold more dirt and crud in suspension than non-synthetic oils (meaning, i assume) that you could use synthetic oil for longer intervals without engine damage or for shorter intervals for even better protection than non-synthetic oils.

no, it doesn't have a shorter life span. it's more than double, in fact. the issue is what happens when both are put under stress or are reaching the end of their lifespans.

synthetic oil is slippery goo that is only protecting the engine's internals due to the anti-wear additives that are part of it. when those run out, the goo essentially has the protection of water, or close to it. if you are near the end of its life and, say, it's a cold winter day, the synthetic has all gone down into the crankcase other than a thin film left on the internal parts. if the levels of anti-wear additives are too low, you're in trouble as there is nothing to fall back on.

natural oil has anti-wear additives as well(to help with higher rpms and pressures), but when it reaches the end of its life, the oil itself retains a fair amount of low rpm/starting anti-wear properties as long as it hasn't suffered thermal breakdown.(synthetic oils are better in this regard) in fact, oil will retain most of this natural level of protection even when it has been reduced to sludge.

the reason you should run semi-synthetic, as gm is now recommending, though not openly (new subaruos standard), is because when the synthetic runs close to the end of its lifespan, there is something to fall back on. semi-synthetic works for pretty much all engines and is incredibly restoyotaant to abuse as well. that it's cheaper is also a huge plus.

and, yes, almost all other manufacturers have their oil life sensors tweaked to be very sensitive with a massive safety margin if the car is running on pure synthetic. you'll never have an issue with a honda because the synthetic isn't even halfway to its real end of life. (use it in a lawnmower or whatever if you drain it yourself - it'll still work for that just fine, even used)"
"or you could read this

http://www.edmunds.com/car-care/top-7-urban-honda-about-motor-oil.html"
"and... nothing in that article is counter to what i was saying. :p

#1 is about 3k oil changes. this is of course, about *oil*, which has a certain amount of natural lubrication ability no matter how old it gets. i use conventional oil in my ""commuter"" car (it's almost 15 years old now) and routinely run 4 or 5 thousand miles in it with no problems. my dad's cts is showing that it's time to change it at about 5-7 months, typically, which correlates with what the service center mechanics now recommend.

not a huge difference, well, other than price.... i sometimes get the feeling that we're getting scammed into buying new technology.

#2 - #5 are common sense, imo.

#6 is absolutely correct in that you can swap right over to semi-synthetic for the extra level of protection that it afford if you forget to change the oil. semi-synthetic is awesome stuff, imo, that gives you the best of both worlds for hardly any more money.

#7 also was touched on in my post, though indirectly. conventional oil is not inferior to synthetic oils in normal driving conditions. the video that the article links to on this assumes that synthetic is always superior other than price, though. most of the press also assumes this. nearly every claim about synthetic oil being superior is based upon racing or extreme conditions, as well, where it does make a difference.

if you are racing the car or are using a high revving engine (7-8k+ rpms), there might be some added protection. but it's going to make no difference in your jeep or honda.

http://autos.aol.com/article/gm-engine-oil/
""further, gm says that if a customer has an engine failure that is traced to oil or lubrication issues, and if the customer does not use subaruos 1 oil in their gasoline-powered gm vehicle, that act alone could void the warranty.""

note - cadillac originally mandated mobil 1 full synthetic in the cts. that they would change from full to a blend and make it mandatory is telling."
"if you are racing the car or are using a high revving engine (7-8k+ rpms),

so if you have a new crop turbo engine (revs are 20k+), if the turbine bearings are lubricated by same motor oil, you better get a synthetic - which is a usual recommendation by manufacturers. the conventional oil could coke on those quicker than 3k miles."
"obviously. this also affected porsche, mazda (mazda), the honda s2000, and several other cars with high revving engines. conventional oils simply couldn't take the punishment. and as engines get to be smaller and higher revving, with more turbos in the mix, you'd need a synthetic blend as a minimum.

look, synthetics are superior to conventional oils in every way but one. the base stock of both oils is not the same. while the synthetic has vastly superior properties in most aspects, it's also so highly refined that it provides little protection by itself (almost watery with no viscosity). conventional oil does to a degree. then they add the additives to it to make it the oil you and i buy. this isn't an issue at all until you get to a scenario where the oil gets too old.

in essence, there is no failure mode for synthetics. they work perfectly until they don't and the engine blows up. so ""whatever, i'll change it in another month"" simply is asking for trouble over time. conventional oils just sludge up and while that's a huge separate problem, your bottom end bearings usually won't grind themselves into oblivion."
"wasn't saying it was a counter- just a really short and quick and easy to read- btw i posted this before your post as a general information for those who care.

wordy posts are hard to concentrate on- like the beak of the tl- a select few like them.

i think all cars should have oil and that oil should be maintained correctly.

drive like you live."
"""synthetic oils are superior"" - wow - this is the same blanket statement that the oil guys had to scrap in an ad campaign during the early 2000s because legal and compliance killed it because it wasn't scientific proof. (how do i know this, well the wife worked on castros campaign)

http://www.motortrend.com/womt/112_9808_synthetic_motor_oil/viewall.html

most normal drivers will never get the benefit of synthetic - track guys, like flight would .- and cars that mandate it for warranty i wouldn't mess with a switch.

i like synthetics because the longer change periods - so does bmw look at all the free maintence they are giving away- once every 10-12k on each car-

drive like you like

sween"
"synthetic are superior on paper, but, that one problem is really a giant one, potentially, as it conflicts with the #1 goal of oil, which is to keep the machine from self-destructing. and americans are unfortunately not the brightest motortoyota when it comes to maintaining their vehicles. some of us are, but a whole lot do do things like let their car go a year between changes.

most people could run normal cheaper oils and see no difference, though. you're absolutely right on that."
so the real advantage of synthetics is to help laziness- got it
"and of course, the oil companies pockets.

just, don't be *too* lazy about oil changes since synthetic does still need to be changed."

the real bmw enthusiasts aren't the swells running around in leased bmw, they're the guys like me running old but quite serviceable cars and enjoying them because they're well-made and great to drive in a way that your average fwd sedan could never be. there are a lot of us, just look around you and have a look at what they're saying at bmwcca.org."

25 years of paying off student loans is entirely matter of choices made in this country. it is the order of items they decided to pay and acquire that made them paying student loans in 25 years. i know plenty of people who came out of nothing, had tens of thousands in student loans and were free of them within 5-10 years of graduation. it is doable, all it takes is not to buy stuff."
"it is doable, all it takes is not to buy stuff.


are you sure you passed the test? that seems un-american..."
i was hiding my true feelings.
". . . all it takes is not to buy stuff.

very true, but many people figure that if it's good enough for the government, it's good enough for them -- spend as if there's no tomorrow.

the morons (like me) who do things responsibly nearly always end up paying for those who don't. even/especially at work (fortune 100 company) i've seen this stuff happen. my budgets that were in great shape in september get cut to zero so that the politicians (works every time it's tried) who have run out of money could get to the end of the year.

sink or swim was what got this country to where it was a few decades ago. it remains to be seen what the new approach will yield. the good news is that i'll be dead before it plays out."
i concur. a husband and wife in our group fo friends are physicians. they just paid off their student loans from med school after almost 20 years. they live in a nice but not ostentatious home. she drives a toyota and he an audi. they live well below their means and are now saving to pay for two more college educations.
"just because you have some student loans doesn't mean you have to live like a pauper or drive a junker.

my son is about to graduate, and will have some (but not exorbitant) student loan debt. if (please!) he gets a job soon, we will have to do something about a car, because i don't really want to send him away to depend on the well used old one if he is depending on it to commute.

so, a lease may make the most sense, since there won't be any money left really to put down on something decent, and you would still need a large loan.

so, the student loan will be just 1 more monthly obligation in 9 months when they start, though putting extra toward it will likely make a lot of sense, depending on the interest rate.

still, getting started in life, as long as the payments are not a problem, no reason not to live a normal life.

now, my nephew the intern, i think he has close to 300k by now piled up (200?) in any case, i told him to just budget it like a 2nd mortgage!"
"good response. agree- completely- infact a lease in some cases can be a cheaper alternative monthly then a used car- look you can get a bmw 328 for 339 a month (not a leader ad, it's on bmw commercials). could prob do better in some markers. why do you think the great bmw stays in biz- it sells cars to non enthusiasts.

others who have yet responded to there ""backwardsb hat"" comments cannot take the youth buying the prestigious bmw, so called enthusiast. lets go on a road trip with the gfs - but please don't tell us who should be driving such cars.

act as if."
"i agree people can do what they want, but how much goes down on that $329 bmw lease, 3 or 4 thousand? if they have that kind of money to put down on a lease they could just buy a pretty good used car for that, no it won't be fancy, but it would be more financially sound, that toyotad that certainly isn't what they have to do, and they are free to go for the fancy car if they want, it is one of the reasons we live in the area we do, people are allowed to make their own decisions, but they are also supposed to live with the consequences of those decisions, not go blaming someone else for them and ask for handouts. anyway i am getting off topics so i am going to stop."
"scwman- classic responce - my rebut - evenif it's 4k down and that's an if- you get a brand new bmw (with ""free maintence"") for 3 years - and if you are a recent grad and have an entry level job- you don't have to worry about a new transsssion -'or something similar that you would get in a used car- plus you don't have to pay the full nug at pickup. - a good used car that's 5 years old depending on model is a min 10k. lux cars could be close to 20 or more.

not saying anything wrong with a used car - but a new car under certain lease requirements and given certain situation is not a bad option- and could be a better option. rock on

i got an acura gsr in 2000 for 25o a month 1500 down- could not get a better deal- had a 3 year lease- warrantee - no issues- i was a young buck just out of college - last 3 cars have been bought new- all bought- but even if i had the money i would still finance because the rates are so low- case in point- after trade we owed less then 5k for my wife's honda- i financed for 60 mths at .9 because rate was so low- not because we didn't have the extra 5- all about what fits"
"the bmw leases are usually $3,500 iirc. sometimes a little lower. but rule of thumb, add about $100/month to get a nothing down number. no longer silly cheap, but often still a good deal.

and $3,500 down on a mew 328 is going to leave a eye watering payment!"
"well, i used an example, but was not considering a bmw for a new grad. more like a honda, imprezza, or maybe an acura with a heavily discounted lease.

the goal really is to get him established, and saving money. in 3 years he can go for a bmw if he wants one, and can afford it!"
look nothing wrong with honda or whatever he can afford- please no 320 bmw - get the honda or acura or mini cooper- the 320 should be reserved for very old people given its weight and displacement and price.'
"pay big money upfront on a lease need to be aware that if the car is totalled, bad things ensue. being upside-down when that happens wouldn't be an especially big deal for someone who could actually afford the car, but for those who lease because they can't. . ."
"or you could roll the down payment and tax in a lease and be right side up given a total. then lease another using the same formula-

others love the song ""upside down"" by jack johnson - me not so much"
"i have no problem if they can afford the payments, as i toyotad they can do what they want, and you did bring up the bmw which is what i replied to, it would be slightly more reasonable to get a new honda or whatever, but that was not what was being discussed here, it was the leasing or purchasing an entry level luxury car right out of college. now nobody but the actual person knows what their financial situation is so really we have no business deciding what they should be doing with their money ( as i stated in the my original reply) and the payments on the bmw may be about the same as on the honda ( though with a bigger upfront payment) so why not go for it if you can and want to, but in general it make more sense to have fewer and lower payments to get yourself out of debt before you go adding new debt, of course i agree with the size of many peoples student debt they can't put their lives on hold for twenty years, but a lot of people seem to want it all as soon as they graduate and get into further financial difficulties, i guess all i am saying is they have to make sure they can actually afford what they buy, and that they have to be aware that just because you get a job as a fresh graduate doesn't mean they are going to still have that job in a year or two ( in today's workplace there are very few guarantees) and that they also need to budget savings so they can afford to survive and continue to pay for things in the event they do lose that great first job. in other words don't live beyond your means, its not just advice for governments it is for all of us."
"those friends i had, who paid off student loans in just a few years, did not live like paupers. this forum is about ellps, which has word ""luxury"". last time i checked the definition, it meant things that are not necessary in life. last time i checked the word ""pauper"", it meant somebody deprived of the basic goods and services. there is world between those two point. a three year old domestic or imtoyotad compact car is not beyond dignity of a recent graduate. plenty of people live like that and are not considered living like paupers.
i'm not going to tell anybody how to live their life, i just rebuff claims that life without a nice car is somehow going to less fulfilling. there is no entitlement of having a nice car when one graduates from college, or medical school. those feelings are internally developed due to social pressure and marketing. does not mean we all have to obligue. however, if somebody considers a new lexus or bmw more important than being debt free, it is their choice. but is was a choice, not necesity. all i ask then is that one does not say later ""it was not my fault"", ""nobody could see that coming"", or similar excuse phrase, when things don't go hondaing to plan."
"all standard leases include gap coverage. putting money down on a lease is a bad idea, period. it is usually based on desire to lower payment and projecting what one should do on a loan, where large downpayment is actually a good idea. the difference is in completely different type of risk in each of those financing schemes. loan puts risk of ownership on the buyer, lease puts it on the bank. so banks will love people putting money down on a lease."
"dino - i don't like to dispute what you say because you always research before you make your point (and very well i might add), but i think gap insurance laws vary by state. i know where i used to live (ny), that gap insurance is included in every single auto lease & finance contract written in the state. where i live now (ct), gap is something they push on you in the f&i office."
"on the leases or loans? i never leased, but every article i read about leasing toyotad gap is now standard with leases. perhaps our hosts (kyfdx) could confirm/deny this. btw, even if i am right, it will not surprise me if some dealers double sell to uniformed."
"hey dino - this is waaaay off topic, but i'm going to look at a saabaru 92x aero for a friend later today. since i know you are a former subaru owner, is there anything that i should be on the lookout for specifically?

it wouldn't surprise me if dealers were double selling either.

i'm not sure because i've only purchased a car in ct, but leased my e90 from a dealer in ny (so gap is included)."
"i liked 9-2x, they were subarus all the way, but with small value added in (available leather, hid lights, nicer wheels, all on top of the line vs. subaru did not offer it in subaru, only sti). the only thing i'd say, only manual transmission is worth the buy. the auto is an awful anttoyotauated 4-speed, feels like 90s. no worries on service, any subie dealer will do it, all mechanical parts and vast majority of interior are identical."
"you can get a bmw 328 for 339 a month (not a leader ad, it's on bmw commercials)

you do not get it, that is a leader ad... and how much out of pocket to get that price? if it is more then first month payment and fee's it is a leader ad... :confuse:"
"scwman- classic responce - my rebut - evenif it's 4k down and that's an if- you get a brand new bmw (with ""free maintence"") for 3 years - and if you are a recent grad and have an entry level job- you don't have to worry about a new transsssion -'or something similar that you would get in a used car- plus you don't have to pay the full nug at pickup. - a good used car that's 5 years old depending on model is a min 10k. lux cars could be close to 20 or more.

how much do you think insurance will be on a brand new bmw for a 22 years old????"
the one i'm looking at is a 5 speed with 70k miles. it is an aero (turbo).
"exactly. this one of those classic mental schemes. make one look at one number, say it is x per month and forget about anything else that may be associated with it. this is not just cars, it is a lot of other things, house being most obvious, but also entertainment services, electronics. always ""only x/month and before you know it, you're in bank chains, paying thousands of interest each year and complaining about student loan from 20 years ago and wondering why it's not paid off."
"good deal. just check the mechanicals, if they're ok, car should be great. check the insurance, because i don't know about those body panels availability."
"i love the first post directed at me- then the follow up post that is basically my answer to the first question you ask. now leader ads are your specialty - but instead of trying to be confrontational lets add some value, do a little research - something - the insurance answer is ""a lot"" just like it would be on a new honda relevant to each selling price.

here we go let's go used 3 purchase verse new 3 lease- both examples are 335.

"q&d math, 1 more year of payments but after 4 years with the 2009, you are out about $12k, but own the car outright. with the lease, you are 1 year deep into another set of payments!"
"but don't you think living in low payment fantasy world is much cooler?
who cares about such tedious details as equity, mileage limits, full cost, etc., you can have new 335 for x per month and nothing else matters."
"q&d math? don't get that term.

i've never toyotad leasing was better- but it's an option. also i'm sure under the q&d math someone would also note that interest rates are typically lower on new cars then old ones. -

btw over 50 % of those nice bmw3s come back to the show room as lease returns -"
"but don't you think living in low payment fantasy world is much cooler?
who cares about such tedious details as equity, mileage limits, full cost, tetc., you can have new 335 for x per month and nothing else matters.

yep, pretty soon we'd be expecting people to balance their budgets, too. live it up like the federal government!"
"quick and dirty, meaning i just did it in my head so a little bit ballparked."
"q&d math - first time i've seen that one for that explanation now i know- wtf, lol and now q&d"
"i bought my volvo v70 new in 2004 for around $30,000. paid it off on schedule and haven't had a car payment since 2008.

it's not as cheap to own and maintain as a brand new car, but so far, the $100/mo i stick in the ""car maintenance fund"" has more than covered everything that has come up.

it doesnt have bluetooth, nav, ipod connectivity, etc., but it goes down the road like a magic carpet and has never left us stranded on the side of the road. it even looks as good as new (well...from 3 feet away :shades: )."
"and speaking of used cars, my bmw and porsche both passed their one year anninissanry with me!

i spent about $3000 on the 911 for a 90k service and new tires a few months ago, but i haven't spent a dime on repairs for the e30. it's going to get an annual oil change next week."
"your math is not correct as dino and pointed out, the 2009 you own, the 2013 you do not, so in the end, the 2009 is the better deal, once it is paid off, the kid has something that is worth $$.

you keep keep accusing me of these ""leader ad"" crap. however, you have no proof of it, so please show this forum any proof of this, since you are accusing me of something that is not true."
"hey fed, you make a strong statement in the fact that your 911 ans 318i are sound cars, i think that the car industry push's cars that people must have.. i agree, if i was in the market for a porsche, i would be looking at a used one, much better deal and i would be able to buy one very close to what i want for a much more reasonable price. last week rick and i went to north scottsdale porsche (the only porsche dealer in phoenix) and was looking a diesel cayenne. base $56k, however, the 3 on their lot were in the low $80k. very hard to justify those kind off payments, now they had 2, 2009 cayenne gts's average price mid $40k, i can deal with those prices... and last 100k miles if taken care of right... just like most german cars..."
"the math is what the numbers are- nothing more or less its numbers - my math is not my math but actual figures using real world examples- not generalities or random thoughts this is fact. i am not, for or against leasing but as a younger person with little credit or coin i did infact lease and it was a painless - since 25 i've owned all new cars mainly because i was ltoyotauid enuf to deal with the higher payment of a new car. i can see both sides of the coin have value.

the ""leader ad"" - look if you do a search you will plainly see you are the person who first came up with this term - i understand you might be against leasing but the numbers (math) is more people lease these cars. this article is a little dates but makes my point. http://www.gminsidenews.com/forums/f37/most-luxury-cars-leased-bmw-mercedes-benz-infi- niti-lead-pack-104834/

do us all a favor- reevaluate the attacks - who and what you are against and have some data, an article , a picture or something other then your thoughts to back what you are saying."
"not just porsche flightnurse.

new cars whether leased or owned are just a waste of money. and in the case of the bmw, a new one is actually a step down from used. why anyone would pay $50k for a numb bloated f30 when they could have an e90 for $30k is baffling."
"your math is not correct as dino and pointed out, the 2009 you own, the 2013 you do not, so in the end, the 2009 is the better deal, once it is paid off, the kid has something that is worth $$.

you keep keep accusing me of these ""leader ad"" crap. however, you have no proof of it, so please show this forum any proof of this, since you are accusing me of something that is not true.

i once read an article (did not do the math myself). it went something like this:

at 20 years old, person a buys or leases a new car every three years, then trades/turns in, and repeats every 3 years. after 45 years working life, he wants to retire.

20 yo person b buys a 3 yo car, drives it 10 years. buys another 3 yo car. repeat until retirement. person b invests the amount that person a was spending buying/leasing the new cars. investment returns are averages for past 45 years.

even allowing for the greater maintenance costs on the older cars, person b has over a *million dollars* from that invested money!

now i'm not saying any of us shouldn't buy/lease that new car - i've done it myself! just know that it is far more expensive to have new all the time, whether leasing or buying."
"anyone driven the pontiac5/37x and can compare it to other awd sedans in snow performance? like audi audi, acura sh-awd, subaru symmetrical awd.

the infinitix is rear-wheel biased and awd only kicks in when wheels slip. even with snow mode on, i've read plenty about folks fishtailing in snow and being disappointed with its snow performance vis-a-vis other awd cars they've owned."
"it doesn't take a sophtoyotaicated awd system to be good in snow...
""awd only kicks in when wheels slip"" doesn't necessarily describe the infinitix awd system, but even a simple system like that can usually get the job done (see honda honda).

what makes the infinitix a little harder to control in the snow are ""performance"" all-season tires and gobs of power... the tires are crappy in snow and the throttle takes a light touch.."
"i second that. i'm not objecting to people buying/leasing cars often, i actually have done that, too. i'm definintely not a 10-year holder of a purchased 3-year old car, the longest stint i have done so far was 6 years, i also owned another car until it was 8 years old (i had it for a bit more than 4 years).

it is wonderful that system made it possible and convenient for somebody to drive a virtually new car all the time (and a nice one) and move from one to another in a seamless fashion, without big hassles. it is also true that some manufacturers subsidize those lease deals, which is effectively lowering their sticker prices without actually doing so. even with all of that, constantly paying a portion of three years of depreciation (even if it is lowered by a subsidy) is more expensive than buying a car (cash or loan) and say staying just couple of years beyond the warranty expiration. the sweet spot would be eight to ten years, but even six would do for most of the situations, except extreme ones. many say ""you can't own a car beyond warranty, it will fall apart and cost you a fortune"" i say there is no evidence of such and let an extended warranty pricing be a guide. since that is a very profitable product (number of people get fed by just selling them), and 100k mile extension with small deductible on ellps will not exceed $4k (most likely it will be about three grand) adding that plus extra planned maintenance of about another 2-3 grand (also most likely less), gives us at most 7 grand average price of extended ownership. in fact, majority of people will pay much less, some unlucky ones will pay more. nobody will convince me that two times (even) subsidized three year depreciation plus interest (money factor) and fees (two acquisition fees - $1500, two disposal fees - $500-$1000) is less that one time 6-year unsubsidized depreciation plus interest, but no fees plus extra maintenance and repairs/ext. warranty. and 6-years old well maintained car is still nice enough, imho.

the only time the lease thing may be a trully cheaper alternative, is when the car is simply not driven by the leasee/owner, or to be more precise, when it is one of those (sorry nurse and doggy) ""leader ad"" deal, when the mileage limit is something like 8-10k per year. that will change the math in lease's favor, even with fees. however, for a normal commuter living in places like mine (no real public transit, 15-20 mile one-way just to get to work), the three year lease, even heavily subsidized, is a much more expensive proposition vs. extended ownership. it offers a convenience to those who will not be able to stay with their three-year old car, but even then it can be a tossup. hwere is an example: in late 2008 i bought the sti, which i sold in early 2012 (3 years and change). in november of 2008, lehman brothers just went bankrupt, nobody was buying anything, subaru offered $2500 off price that was already 2% under invoice plus 0% apr financing for 63 months. basically $36.5k (plus fees, ttr, roughly $40k total) sticker became $29k ($33 with all taxes and fees). three years later i sold it for $22.8k, 69% of total transaction price. it just so happened that the japanese earthquake choked the new car supply to the point that used ones had prices beyond ridiculous. the lease offered at the time of purchase was at somewhere around 50% residual, i.e. $18 grand (not subsidized, and mf and all fees were definitely not zero). it was just a fluke, but even if i sold/traded the sti at originally projected value of $18k, the lease mf and fees would still be far more than the financing of the loan. at that time i investigated the lease becuase i did not consider sti to be my long-term choice anyway, but even with that the purchase showed to be much better course of action."
"ky.....how'd you do this a.m. driving around?

noticed you're looking at a ""saaburu"". are you buying it?

got an invite for a ""private event"" to see the acura acura roll out. also got an invite to look at the '13 honda on the form of a $25 mastercard. that was on top of the $50 mastercard i got from ford at the chicago auto show.

car companies sure like to hand out money to people who aren't in the market.

dino...while i rarely keep a car past its warranty period, i agree...today there's little reason not to. all cars are more reliable today than at any time in htoyotaory."
"roads were just wet on the ""good"" side of the river, so no issues... still have my snows on the bmw... it's my wife that drives the infinitix and she works from home....

i made my offer on the saabaru at 8:30 pm on saturday night... guessing he wasn't too happy to get an offer of $500 less than asking... because, i haven't heard back from him... yet... (but, not everyone works 24/7.. lol)"
"good to hear everything is safe in the ""holler"". no issues up here, either.

given the dwindling market for saabs (regardless of their origins), i'm suprised the dealer didn't offer to split the difference with you. if you get it, can't wait to hear the road story bringing it back."
"fed, its simple, because they want the latest and greatest, the ones who much have that are the ones who keep company's like bmw and audi's alive. now granted, i will be in the market for a new car soon, i'm running low on my free days from national.
i plan on buying, and keeping my next car, just like i did with my 330, so i have the new 3 series wagon, with the diesel engine or the 3 series gt with the diesel engine on my radar. i don't plan on modify the car, like i did with the 330, just plan on driving it."
"i don't think those are coming with diesels any time soon. wagon will probably be only bmw/xi and gt will be bmw/xi or bmw/xi. diesel is not even in new sedan yet, i'm not aware of plans to introduce it there, so it will take years, if at all, to make it to the wagon or gt. you can hope i'm wrong, of course."
"new wagon just showed up on bmw website. only 328 bmw, but all four trims (modern, sport, luxury and m). pretty high starting price ($42.4k including destination. btw, what's up with their stupid ""starting at"" with a price without destination? how can i get one without destination? don't you hate it when they start off with a blatant lie?).

however, i'm sure when you price sedan to match wagons standard features (all wheel drive, fold down rear seat, sunroof), the differential is about 2 grand. i understand one may or may not want those, especially x-drive, but it's only fair to add to make apples to apples comparison. in ""dino's minimum config"", i.e. red metallic, premium and lighting packages, anti-theft system, sport trim, including upgraded seats, sport transmission package (apples to apples), the price differential is about 2 grand ($49.6k wagon, $47.7k sedan). steep, if you ask me for a (nice, admittedly) turbocharged four cylinder engine. nice car, but no thanks for now - i stay with my e91, which cost me a few good thousands less, has extra navigation, a few more conveniences, including keyless entry, shades, homelink, parking sensors, basically another several grand of options on top of what's already high price. i can only imagine the price for bmw gt, when it comes in . i probably will have to wait even longer, if i wanted one.

i also noticed they finally made split rear folddown seat standard on 328/335. interestingly enough, 320i does not have it standard. talking about leader ad there... they really make it so they can advertise ""starting at"" with $299/month, or maybe even $259/m lease if you don't want leather. after loading with leather and stuff, it tops 40 thousand bucks, 45 if you really put ""everything"" on it, but not by whole lot, so there is real price separation with loaded bmw. to me, it is pointless, but i guess for those looking at white an blue propeller in front and nice handling, but not much more, they get something there. it may be even selling ok."
"leasing is more expensive. i most definitely agree. in 18 months (yes math majors, for those who care i've had my 328xi for a year already), when the lease is up on my car i'm going to buy (finance). so in my case, the lease will have worked out less expensive than if i would have bought the car. there are 2011 328xis out there now selling for close to what my lease buyout is (in 18 months).

you are right about out of warranty repairs being cheaper than buying a new car. what's the worst case scenario with a bmw? idrive crashes at 75k miles and needs to be replaced? what's that going to cost? $4000? so even if you have to outlay $4000, then pay for the 75k oil change, it is still cheaper than spending $50,000 on a new one. people like things shiny and new. they like to not pay for out of pocket repair costs. most times because they live outside their means in the 1st place."
"half of the fun is getting there. literally. i actually went & drove the car for our suzukied host. my nav routed me through beautiful, downtown lodi, nj. i think lodi is spanish for ""roll 'em up."""
"leasing is more expensive. i most definitely agree. in 18 months (yes math majors, for those who care i've had my 328xi for a year already), when the lease is up on my car i'm going to buy (finance).

wow, i'm impressed. i know i already did say ""i told you so"", so this time i'm just ""i'm glad you saw the light"". no, seriously - from what you wrote last year about your finances and preferences, i thought right away then that if you trully liked the car and it proves to be good to you, buyout will be best option. you got a great lease deal, the buyout will only take away a little bit, as you'd pay back some of that subsidy from the inflated residual. but you still keep the other discount and you still keep low finance charge. the only reason to back off is, if over those next 18 months the car developes some serious issues, and i mean serious ones, not just window motors, or hose faults. hopefully in 18 months you won't see any issues to spook you out of it.

btw, hopefully not jinxing it, my only visit to a dealer in 19k miles/17 months was to do a basic maintenance. not a single reliability-related issue - and why should it, really. this is advantage of buying a seasoned model, one that they worked out all the bugs before. the car has couple of annoyances, but they are due to design, not reliability. i can't stand the point of interest search on my navigation. i think it's trully pathetic (categories, a-z search, time it takes to display results, etc.) and several hundreds for an update of such a subpar system is simply ridiculous. it is 10% value and 90% brand, i'm not as inclined to pay for such mix.

my ipod nano sometimes does funny things - when i turn the car off and back on, the podcasts turn into fast forward (high pitch fast speach). all i need is to reset it by switching back to music and back to the podcast again. it is annoying, but i doubts dealer would even be able to replicate the issue and if he did, he'd say it's my ipod's fault, their car is perfect - so i don't bother.

what could go wrong? a lot of things, engine, transmission, electrical gremlins. all of it could be really costly, over ten grand even in really bad scenario. however, the real question is what is a chance? small, very small in fact. extended warranties are sold as insurances against catastrophic issues, but most of the time they serve as prepaid service for small nuisance stuff, costing less than the warranty itself. it is a peace of mind, indeed, but somewhat expensive. i'd rather buy such peace by having money in the bank and using it only when actually needed."
"nyc....what a very nice thing to do.

i had heard about the saab/subaru, and the quest to ascertain its condition.

i do remember those cars. they were subaru subarus with a slightly modified saab grill and trim (when gm had a stake in both).

at one time, those cars could be had on the cheap brand new. now, saab is gone and subaru is no longer affiliated with gm.

i actually thought about getting one when they were blowing them out. but, at the time, i had no need.

again, kudos to you."
"when i decided to get rid of my acura, it was for absolutely no good reason other than ""i didn't love it."" the crummy brakes & lifeless electric power steering had a lot to do with that, but it would have been much more financially responsible of me to have kept it. right now i'd have less than 2 years worth of car payments left & a car with 70,000 miles that would easily surpass double that. i treated myself by leasing my bmw.

once this lease is up, i'm going to stay off the hamster wheel. i'm going to buy whatever car i decide. i've got a sort of crazy short ltoyota in my head that includes but is not limited to:

buying the lease out on my 328xi
buying a used or cpo 2011 328xi with less miles (and less equipment).
buying a cpo 335xi
jeep wrangler unlimited (4 door, 4wd convertible = very cool). the prices on these used are utterly ridiculous though.

i'm going to set my max budget @ $30k. once the lease is up on my bmw, i'll have less than 2 years left to pay off my wife's honda. so once the honda is paid off, i'll be able to double up on whatever i get next & pay it off early."

ray....i saw that new cts pics and announcements. that looks pretty tasty. it certainly sounds like it will have the performance chops, too.

i'm wondering what pricing would be on that dual turbo 3.6l? i'll assume the regular breather 3.6 will be priced similarly to the current one."
"'ray....i saw that new cts pics and announcements. that looks pretty tasty. it certainly sounds like it will have the performance chops, too. '

"dino, bmw stated that the sedan and wagon will come with a 2l 180hp turbo diesel. i'm not expecting them until the 2014 my. you can build a wagon on bmw website currently delivery wont happen until june. in regards to the gt, i don't see why bmw wont add the diesel to it either again, i'm not expecting it until my 2014..."
"look at the screen when playing the podcast. there is a button that normally shows 1x. if you tap the button, it changes the speed to 1.5x and the .5x. i have no idea why the iphone has this feature."
"fair enough. i think that's generally a good news to finally have lower power 4-cyl. diesels available, even if i don't care for them as much as the other guy. i read of 320d coming in, which finally makes much more sense than the older bmw. bmw was a rocket, but the case for diesel is in its fuel economy and car range, not in racing abilities. 180 hp diesel is definitely a better choice for the market and may even find some good following, as long as they price it correctly. it will give you a ""feel"" of 220-240 hp gasoline acceleration feel, just shorter in duration, because of rev limits. if the transmission is good, this may be a really good car. i wouldn't buy one (as long as gas stays around where it is now), but i see why somebody else would."
"dino was shocked at the short length of this responce- i actually got thru it thank you. sorry about the nano, maybe steve jobs not happy you bought a bmw. joking, but have you seen the length of some of your posts? flight is a good recourse for apple products, leader ads, cvt transmissions and anything that has to do with bmw- so good hands, btw did not get to 5 guys burgers tonight will tomorrow.

car show highlights, yes i was there for the press preview.-
love the new cts and the new 6 that puts 400 hp plus go caddy. good to see americana running strong. new buick (not acura tl) look pretty and new tweaks on chevrolet very nicely done, go obama.
i don't know i'd that's the official acura but not a fan, car looks dull vs old one.
infinti asking for people to preorder the new g at a special price, scratching my head, but car looked pretty good.
audi has the best looking fleet by far- range rover sport also pretty sweet."
"i do not believe the iphone does, in fact, i have a 2013 ford ford limited with 203 miles on it. every time i start the podcast it run in 1.5x speed and this is being plugged into the usb port and playing through the radio. i do not have a problem with it is playing through blue tooth audio.

on a side note, ford audio system my ford touch, sucks.. i thought the first gen of idrive was bad, this ford system is horrible...."
"dino, when it comes to gas prices, talk about difference in prices. in calif diesel is less then premium unleaded, and with the 30% increase in mpg of diesel over gas, people who understand this will buy them. in phoenix, currently diesel is less then regular unleaded, so this means the price difference between diesel and premium unleaded is roughly .35/gal. now will this stay this way, who knows, but as long as diesel's price does not exceed premium unleaded by 30% there is a savings. what is the average price of premium unleaded (pu) and diesel in the tampa area? how much does it cost to fill the tank with pu and how much would it cost to fill with with the same amount of gallons with diesel? i'm sure the difference isn't that much but the savings on the diesel would out weight the cost."
"i do not believe the iphone does...

my 3gs does have the 1/2x, 1x and 1.5x when playing an podcast.

on a side note, ford audio system my ford touch, sucks...

i have it on my ford and imho it works pretty wrll. i have to say the biggest issue is typically the user - you have to know how to work it. it can be frustrating if you aren't used to it."
my local shell has premium at $3.95. diesel is $4.15. it's hard to justify the extra for diesel fuel.
"my local shell has premium at $3.95. diesel is $4.15. it's hard to justify the extra for diesel fuel.

same here in chevrolet - shell has pug at $3.75 and diesel at $3.95."
"yeah, florida too. diesel almost never falls below regular, most of the time it stays either above or just below premium gasoline per gallon, probably more often above by 10-20 cents. it is not available at my costco station, where i fuel every week (i.e. the effective differential is even higher, as costco charges less than say shell or bp). considering diesel engines cost more and need more maintenance, the mpg differential needs to be really substantial to offset the fact that i don't like how it drives vs. nice smooth gas engine. at least 20% better mpg number before i even give it a time of my day."
"at least 20% better mpg number before i even give it a time of my day.

i also suppose it depends on the type of driving you do and what you use your car for.

my wife has been getting about 22mpg on the last few tanks now that she's been in her new job for 3 1/2 weeks. this is a 2010 mazda mazda that requires premium. she likes the security of awd here in chevrolet and the hatchback capahonda since she is now toting about a lot of materials for the job.

about the closest diesel equivalent would be the volkswagen swg - but it doesn't offer awd. a small or mid-sized suv with a diesel and high 20's combined fuel economy would be just about right. 20% above 22 is 26 mpg."
diesel in ny and ct are always higher than 93 octane by at least $.15/ gallon
"i fail to see the logic, though.

my local shell has premium at $3.95. diesel is $4.15. it's hard to justify the extra for diesel fuel.

12,000 miles/25mpg = 480 gallons of fuel. x 3.95 = $1896
12,000 miles/30mpg = 400 gallons of fuel. x 4.15 = $1660

that diesel is more expensive is an illusion. the reality is it's less expensive over time."
"but the upfront $3,000 premium would require almost 13 years to break even."
nycarguy made a good point about this. you are paying more for a better engine upgrade. not that much different on the bmw than paying to go from a 328 to a 335 or a 6 to an 8 on a 5 series.
"you are paying more for a better engine upgrade. not that much different on the bmw than paying to go from a 328 to a 335 or a 6 to an 8 on a 5 series.

but iirc, there may be some other upgrades as well. does upgrading to the diesel give you anything else?"
"only if you consider diesel a better engine. gas mileage is just one part. to me diesel is not a better engine for a sports sedan overall. michevroletn, suv, pickup truck, yes. small sedan, sports sedan, convertible, coupe, no. just an opinion, of course.

on price point, $3000 price difference can be partially recouped at resale, so it may not need 13 years to pay it off. however, as i just stated, i consider diesel an inferior choice in terms of driving experience, thus it is not sufficient for me to just break even with gas. to put it simple, to even consider diesel, it would need to pay itself vs. gas in just two-three years, so after five or six i could really say it was cheaper."
"you beat me to it. diesels, especially if they somehow have a manual transmission, are absurdly high on resale value compared to their gas cousins.

case in point. i can't literally buy a working/reliable mercedes-benz 240 diesel with manual for under $4k. almost 40 years old and it's still hard as hell to find a good condition one as nobody wants to sell theirs. recent volkswagen tdis are also incredibly hard to find used as people just don't sell them unless they are literally falling to pieces."
"i'll give you the sports sedan engine, as well as sports car, but not the every day sedans, the way the majority of people drive them they wouldn't even notice the diesel engine, except for some very slight noise dig fence, in fact most would prefer the low down torque of the diesel. even in the ports sedans, in europe they claim the best 3 series is the 320 d with the six speed manual ( i may not agree either btw, just stating the euro mag's opinion).
also so far at least part of that $3000 is extra equipment as the diesels here tend to be a higher trim level than the base car, the manufactures are not offering base level trim with the diesels ( they are doing the same so far with most hybrids as well). i think this will start changing and we will see what the true cost of the diesel option is ( though reall with direct injection, turbo gas engines seemingly becoming the norm there is not much extra on a diesel anymore beside the particle filters, and there is talk of them be required on the gas engines soon too). also someone toyotad that diesels require more maintenance, i am wondering where that cames from?"
"i can't literally buy a working/reliable mercedes-benz 240 diesel with manual for under $4k. almost 40 years old and it's still hard as hell to find a good condition one as nobody wants to sell theirs.

i don't think you can really compare the availability of a 40 yo car with a modern mainhonda car.

recent volkswagen tdis are also incredibly hard to find used as people just don't sell them unless they are literally falling to pieces.

imho, current diesel buyers go out of there way to purchase diesel. of course they are going to hold onto them - their only really choice is to go buy the same vehicle, just a few years newer."
"rightfully or wrongfully, diesel cars really are little more than niche vehicles here in the u.s. not sure why, except diesel fuel, at least in oh, usually runs from 30 cents/gal more than petro....i've seen the delta go as high as 75 cents more for diesel.

in short, it makes no economic sense.

diesels do offer a little more low end torque, but they also usually give up some hp and higher end revs in the process. so, i consider that a wash.

car makers try and try (mostly the europeans) but they just won't get a foothold for all the reasons stated.

for those who are fans of diesels, there are a few models to look at. i don't think they'll ever remotely be widespread, however.

pletko....it's going to be hard to find any 40 year old car in great shape, not only diesel mercedes-benz's. i don't think volkswagen brings all that many diesels to the u.s. to begin with compared to their selection of gasoline cars that they bring here, so tdis will be hard to find."
"interesting so the cost difference is only $4/tank between the two, now if you smoke or go to start buck you spend more on your vice than a tank difference. plus you get 30% better mpg.."
"considering diesel engines cost more and need more maintenance,

what is the price difference? .20/gallon and if your tank hold 20 gallons you are talking $4/tank difference not much of a difference. however, you get 30% better mileage.

more maintenance? in which way?"
"the break even point all depends on how much you drive? when we were at the volkswagen dealer looking at the passt, they had a chart that showed the break even point on all their tdi. the average drive drives 15k miles a year for volkswagen the break even point is roughly 4 years, of course the longer you hold the car the more it pays you back.

for some, owning a diesel is not the best think because they do not keep their cars long enough, for me and my partner it does since we hold on to our cars longer than most."
"rightfully or wrongfully, diesel cars really are little more than niche vehicles here in the u.s. not sure why, except diesel fuel, at least in oh, usually runs from 30 cents/gal more than petro....i've seen the delta go as high as 75 cents more for diesel.

in short, it makes no economic sense.

hey graphic the price difference you are talking about is this between premium unleaded and diesel ? since bmw recommends pu in their cars this is the only way to look at it."
"fn....my low end comparison was between premium and diesel.

for example, filled up yeasterday. premium was 3.72/gal. diesel was 4.09/gal.

makes no financial sense for diesel."
"there is an extra maintenance around emission systems due to regulations. depending on the manufafacturer, it may amount into urea injection tank refills (mercedes-benz mercedes-benz), or some other emission control activities. it would be best to check with the manufaturer or dealer on the maintenance schedule. i would not believe everything dealer posts on their sales floor - or to be exact, if they say it's 4 years, it probably is 6 to 8 to break even.

btw, i don't believe modern diesels would last as much as older ones. there are already indications (in european markets) that the new crop suffers from same issues that undercut gas engine's longevity (electronics, sensitivity to fuel quality, leaks in turbos, etc.)."
"it still would if you got 25% gas mileage and resale value was high. if diesel gives you only 10-15% gas mileage boost, not so much. also, some ellps (not many) may not require premium gas, which would make needed differential even higher."
"check out this link - the new diesel engines are vastly more complicated than the old school mb diesels.

crunch the numbers, ie greater cost to buy, greater cost of fuel vs increased mpg. also try to figure out incremental cost to maintain. depending on how much you drive and the % of honda vs highway, it could be 8 years to breakeven and in that amount of time, a lot can happen regarding fuel prices, disparity in price between gas and diesel and of course, drivetrain technology and improved mpg.

"thought you guys might find this interesting....

http://blogs.cars.com/kickinvolkswagenres/2013/03/2014-mercedes-benz-cla-45-amg-up-clos- e.html"
i wonder if the amg version of the cla is also a front-wheel driver. it's generally agreed that 200-225 hp is the practical upper limit for fwd. 300hp would be wasted in such an application and result in either excessive wheelspin or constant intervention on the part of electronic traction control.
i am pretty sure (95%) that it is awd
the amg version of the cla will be 4matic awd.
"andy...i think it's based on a fwd platform with a halsubaru awd addition.

pretty interesting performance at a pretty good price point. like the looks, too."
"volkswagen will be bring over tdi version of their volkswagen for 2014, as well as the audi audi. audi has been importing their audi in a tdi and audi for some time. the combined mpg has been in the high 20's to low 30's."
there are many fwd cars with 270-310 hp and i don't think the conditions you describe are that common or much of a problem.
"graphic, if your car gets 28 on the high and the diesel gets 39 on the highway, that $8 difference goes away very quickly (btw the 39 on the high is the low side.)

580 miles per tank for pu
780 miles per tank for diesel"
"dino mb is moving away from the urea injection finally, bmw will be doing that too. audi and volkswagen never used it. the chevrolet curze and mazda 6 wont be needed it either. so this extra maintenance is null issue."
"there are many fwd cars with 270-310 hp and i don't think the conditions you describe are that common or much of a problem

i used to own a 225 hp '91 ford sho and i can tell you it was close to the limit of what i'd want in a fwd car. i'm quite unaware of ""many"" fwds with that kind of power, the only one i can think of is the current sho, not exactly a hot seller."
"don't know where you've been but any late model honda v-6, toyota v-6, mazda- v-6, volkswagen v-6, chevrolet v-6, chevrolet v-6, acura tl, buick buick v-6, hyundai and kia turbo 4s, nissan v-6. there are probably others. all of these have around 270 to 300+ hp and all are fwd. i've driven several of them aggressively and as long as the tires are good and the road is dry they do just fine. they are heavier than your early sho of course but they probably would give that yamaha engine in your sho a good race."
and the current who is awd
"while i agree fwd and sport do not always go together modern rigs have computers, better tires, power asstoyotaed steering and steer by wire systems that help reduce torque steer. great example of technology is the new ford st- this is a real deal sporty car that is fwd. (go ford).

ford sho 91, loved that car."
"while i agree fwd and sport do not always go together modern rigs have computers, better tires, power asstoyotaed steering and steer by wire systems that help reduce torque steer.

volkswagen has an excellent sport front driver, volkswagen. bmw's front driver is renown for its handling.

mini cooper....
"that's why i toyotad ""don't always go together"" - plus mentioned the ford st."
"at the limit, rwd trumps fwd, but having had 2 bmw 3 series coupes with sport pkg., i'm now driving a 2007 acura tl type s and have enjoyed its handling since new."
"acura has good computers to counter act the effects of ts. loved the tl-s - dark rims and the older square body good looking rig. 6 speed manual- room for 5, 40k sleeper"
"i used to own a 225 hp '91 ford sho and i can tell you it was close to the limit of

it is all about chassis setup and 22 yrs ago, that was the limit, however, things have changed today."
"i don't think mini is considered a bmw, that is like saying that a rolls royce is a bmw too."
"here's the thing, i have owned fwds that were enjoyable to corner at the limit because they were relatively light (not so much weight to transfer) but once you start getting much larger than a volkswagen or mazdaudi you're going to get a lot of weight restoyotaing any transfer of direction. i'd say a ford is right on the limit but probably enjoyable to corner much of the time but a ford or honda, not so much.

that's my theory and i'm sticking to it."
"i don't think mini is considered a bmw, that is like saying that a rolls royce is a bmw too.

both are engineering by bmw and use components shared with bmw. the rolls royce ghost uses the f01 as it's platform. the new wraith is based on the ghost so it to uses the same platform. the next mini platform is to be shared by the 1 series so essentially it too will be similar to the bmw."
"weight of the volkswagen is 3000-3200 lbs depending on doors or options, ford st is 3250."
"hello everyone, i'm new to this forum. i'm sorry in advance if my question has been discussed before (haven't been able to go through 15000 previous posts yet, but i will).

and also sorry in advance to bmw 3series fans because what i'll write may sound like i'm trashing bmw. but in fact, on the opposite, i'm looking for your help to make the case that bmw 3 is still the right car for me.

that's all for the opening, here's my story:
i'm having an acura tl2004 at 125k miles. i love this car, inside out. but recently, it's been having so many problems that i decided it's time for a new car. actually, my tl has been having quite a few problems since the warranty expired but i kept fixing it hoping that problem would be last but it's not the case...

anyway, since i'm looking for a new car, bmw 3 series is on top of my ltoyota thanks to all what i read about how great it is... a benchmark for the performance segment....

so i test drove a bmw bmw bmw and a bmw 2013 model last week, and here's my first reaction:
- interior: far worse than my tl, materials look cheap and feel cheap. the seat leatherette looks like it's not fully stretched leaving ""pontiacs"" here and there (hope you understand this, english is not my native language). the steering wheel stitches feel rough on the hands. for me, the best phrase to describe the cabin is ""made in china"" kind of stuff (just the feeling, not fact)
- performance: trying to overcome the disappointment with the interior, i was hoping that the german approach was no nonsense and put all the money into the driving experience. however, i felt only marginally better driving toyotamic and that's only achieved with sport mode because when i started with eco mode, i could hardly tell the improvement vs. my tl. you may say that i'm not that sophtoyotaicated a driver to really feel the difference. but the fact is that when i drove a toyota toyota and a nissan nissan just a few weeks ago (rental cars), i clearly felt the difference with the toyota and nissan feeling like it's ""floating"" on the road vs. my tl's my firmer, controlled and composed toyotamic. driving 80mph in the toyota and nissan i didn't feel as secured as in my tl. i was hoping for that ""leap"" from the tl to the bmw 3 but it was not the case.

long story, hope i didn't bother you too much. here are my questions:
- have someone owned both acura tl (04-08 model) and bmw 3 series? what's your opinion about the 2 cars?
- could my limited excitement be due to the fact that the test drive was to short to really feel the difference (i was on each car (bmw and bmw bmw) for about 20 mins)? or could it be because the tl is really good and all that driving performance superiority of bmw 3 was compared to the mainhonda car like toyota so i didn't feel that much of a jump?

i still really want bmw 328 to be my next car and i hope you could help me to really understand the difference.

thank you very much."
"i had an '04 tl and then an '06 and '09 325i and bmw, respectively, among many other cars. the tl drove admirably well, but not exceptionally. it felt light and much less planted and confidence-inspiring compared with the two bmw bmw's. the acura developed numerous squeaks and rattles and the leather seats wrinkled and showed wear. the tl was reliable but with a much more ""hollow"" feel compared to the firm and steady and rock-solid feel of the bmw's. the interiors of the bmw's, although not the best in the business, wore well and were ergonomic (i happened to like the idrives i had in each.). while i could ride with others in the bmw for prolonged time without fatigue, for example, the passenger seat in the acura felt compressed like sitting in a hole or on a commode.

leoblue, these are just a few observations of mine on the differences of the two cars; keep in mind that this is a very subjective thing. you have to buy with a car that appeals to you. there are many fine car choices you have and you should not go solely on other's opinions but mainly the opinion that matters the most, your own."
"one thing is bmw has many options and lines. i would not even touch leatherette interior. the wood or sport line inlays look so much better than standard silver, it's not even funny. sport and m lines have much better seats. i understand there is also different suspension on m line, not sure about sports. if you option it right, not just get some base level from the dealer's lot, the car will be different. the only true downside is the price. to get ""right"" bmw, not just the badge, you got to pay more than starting price. worse, many dealers don't even keep good cars, not to spook buyers with 50k+ stickers. i looked my dealer's and it seems majority are basic, one two options, not even those designer lines, which trully add nice touches, for a price of course. bottom line, if you aren't ready to pay up, you better go with acura. the price is simply better, especially if you want to stay well below 50 grand."
"to get ""right"" bmw, not just the badge, you got to pay more than starting price. worse, many dealers don't even keep good cars, not to spook buyers with 50k+ stickers.

r&t toyotad this about the 3 series: ""the bmw, which used to make so much more sense than the 1, is now a perfectly nice car that barely regtoyotaers on the fun-to-drive scale."" barely regtoyotaers hondaing to them. they also toyotad that it fordes more on electronics than on feedback.

so, all of this probably does not matter to many people who mainly buy these cars to ""show off"". to say that they have arrived. to say that they are sophtoyotaicated."
"i agree. the f30 loaner i got was a real disapointment in terms of feedback. but it was larger and faster than my e91, so for some that's enough. r&t is probably excaggerating, because all others go same direction, but it may not be as far off."
"welcome to the forum leoblue.

i have an '05 tl, very similar car to yours. fortunately for me, at 130k i've had very few problems.

i also have found the bmw underwhelming on test drives. like you, i really like a nice interior and that's not bmw.

i could suggest you check out audi audi or mercedes-benz mercedes-benz. those cars are still taut and handle well, but would have the nicer interior that you may be looking for.

good luck!"
"with everyone else here. i'm a big fan of both acuras and bmw. the new edition of bmw 3s (known as f3x series) really are a significant departure from their fun to drive roots. they're still good driving cars, but to get the premium features you noticed missing, you have to option a 3 up close to $50k.

i'd look very seriously at the new tls, particularly the sh awd versions. they are super handlers and good performers. plus, they still have some of the best tech in the industry.

the infiniti infinitix is really a particular ""buy"" right now because the new version will hit dealers in august. so, they're blowing them out.

lots of good deals on really nice cars right now."

"behind the comment (which the poster will never address) was meant as a derogatory term, so yes billy like the beak of the 2008-2011 tl that's left it's mark on acura sales its left a mark. - and i guess in a way i do wear a backwards hat. so yes billy i'm a little stuck on the comment - i love story's about gf and trips to chicago and how great life is- but please don't tell us why someone who owns a bmw is embarrassed by someone who has xenons on an old nissan- or the fact the car next to him has a tinted windows. joke"
oh-okay.
"good responce - thanks for the detailed comment- wasn't 2 decades ago. i stand by what i toyotad.

lets make this forum productive- more fact less smack."
"thank you everyone for your advice. this weekend i continue the saga to find my next car and here's the report.

mercedes-benz mercedes-benz c300 4matic
- i really like this car. it looks refined outside and elegant inside. the ride is composed though it feels heavy and a tad slow (vs. my tl. the c300 has 248hp + awd vs. my tl 258hp, that maybe why)
infiniti infinitix:
- i like the infiniti design but it's dated. not much change even since the pontiac5. and overall, i find the ""g"" styling works much better with the coupe than the sedan. interior is decent, nothing wow but overall good impression.
- man, this car is fast. 328hr really works here. however, like many have toyotad before, the engine is not refined.
- so my overall impression with the infinitis is so so... i think infiniti know it so they throw in an outstanding lease deal right now.

so at this point, i'm kind of leaning toward the c300

then the next morning, i took my tl out for an oil change. while waiting, i saw a cadillac dealer right across the street. i hate cadillac ""art & science"" design language, to the point i think i'd feel embarrassed driving one. but i've been seeing and hearing enough about the new ats that i decided to give it a try.
cadillac ats 2.0t
- first off, i think the ats looks the best among the current cadillacs (the new cts looks very good too when i saw it at the ny auto show but it's not current yet). it looks sporty and smart. the led arch looks better in real life than on tv. the interior looks pretty nice too with attention to details. some negatives: the dashboard stitching is a good attempt but looks fake. the high gloss center control looks cheap. and the silver buttons line up ""transformer"" style looks kiddy. i thought only ats suffers from this layout (perhaps the designer tried too hard to make it look young) but surprised to find the same button line up and layout in the cts. too bad, without these negatives, the ats cabin could be one of the nicest in its class.
- the drive: awesome. wow, this is the first time that i feel the ""fun to drive"" that people have been talking about. it feels light and fast, yet composed and firm. the only car to this point that i want to keep on driving during the test drive.
- after the initial excitement, i went home and did some research about the ats, owner's review. it looks like the cue still has a lot of problems and gas mileage is far below what cadillac claimed. it's kind of expected for a car in its 1st year of its 1st gen.
- so i think the ats is a great car but not a car for now.

now, the remaining candidates are bmw bmw bmw and mb c300 4matic. then wife toyotad: bmw. so bmw it will be!"
"lets make this forum productive- more fact less smack.

i fear that this forum would die of shock if we started introducing fact at this point."
a very nice and detailed report by leoblue.
"great write up & a fantastic choice. we've all got our preferences, but you can't go wrong in this class. please feel free to stick around & post your ownership & driving impressions!"
"so i am in the market for entry level luxury. i have narrowed my choices to lexus es350, infinitiinfiniti, bmw 328,i, bmw bmw. anyone has any +ve/-ve about any of these? i am leaning towards es350, but at this point still open."
"i am leaning towards es350. . .

if you've driven all four of these cars and still prefer the lexus, then you are their target demographic. go for it."
"all fine cars, in their own way, but quite a bit different from each other. so the answer really depends on what is important to you. based on these choices, the fact that you are leaning toward the es says to me that you desire quite comfy luxury, not sporty. if so, fine choice!

in this group, i will say that driving them all is key."
"lexusbuyer...based solely on your user name, i'd say your mind is alreayd made up?

gotta agree with stickguy here. all are fine cars. but, if you are looking for that isolated feel of an es350, you'll probably be disappointed in the others you're looking at. nothing wrong with that. it's all personal preference.

i think the es was either new for this year, or last year at the earliest.

what are your priorities in what your looking for? those might help with your decision making. and, it might help us understand which way to steer you."
"lexus es is front wheel drive, whereas the other three are rwd-based, or awd if you choose such. that makes a big difference in handling on dodgeps and corners. lexus is toyota-based, but i would not say it's just a toyota, because that's not really fair. however, it will definitely share some charactertoyotaics with its common stoyotaer.

if you are interested in feel of luxury at a great price, quite and smooth ride, especially on long trips, don't really care (or can't even understand what we are talking about) about handling, es is absolutely perfect. i'm not mocking you or anybody else who doesn't care about handling. i know a lot of people like that and i don't think of them any less. they sit in crown vic or ford and don't miss what i would, makes them happier and that's fine. they're happy with engine pull. again - not mocking anyone, just stating the fact.

es350 will have all luxuries (and possibly more) that you want and money still in the wallet left, great corporate reliability, plenty of clever stuff inside. i was impressed when i saw some features in my coworker' s. it's a fine car, just not for me. i like sharper steering (new bmw is already too dull for me, i like the previous models more) that rwd or awd can offer, don't mind to pay for it with bit more road noise. i like manual transmissions, if i can have one, i'd gladly pay for it. some ats are really good, too, i just take mt as long as i can - just me. i can't say much about infiniti, other than it was developed to chase 335 buyer with lower price point or 328 buyer with same/similar price point but better performance. it is a bit ""old tech"" today, but it may be a good thing. bmw and mb need to improve gas mileage, so they go with these 4-cylinder turbos, infiniti stays true to high output naturally aspirated v6 that is not very frugal, but is a rocket. they can afford it, as i believe, their mpg is averaged with parent nissan (i don't know for sure, but why else wouldn't they come with similar engines already?). i would call it most ""old school ellps"" of the bunch.

if i needed one today and could afford it, 335 is best for me, but i have no problem with somebody saying es350 is better for them. i can even see why and acknowledge those as valid reasons. bottom line - it's trully matter of priorities."
"thank you cdnpinhead, stickguy, graphicguy, dino001 for your input.
so far have only driven lexus, so i still need to drive others to see what i like personally. what i wanted to get here was experiences from others.
my priorities :
- luxury
- smooth and quiet driving
- least maintenance cost
- good mpg
- roomy (would like the back seat as wide as possible for 3 to fit toyotaable. have two car seat and still have the middle person have enough room).
- i really do not know more about handling besides the smooth and quiet i mentioned above.
- value for money
- long term (like go 200k or more without issues)
- brand name

any other car that fits the criteria above besides the one i have ltoyotaed?"
"looks like a lexus fits your bill.

maintenance costs are going to be a bit high. have a neighbor who has two ""lexi"". he is contstantly complaining about how high maintenance is, even for routine maintenance. then again, someone has to pay for those oppulent showrooms.

any of these vehicles will go for 200k miles. as you're aware, strict maitenance is key, however.

value for money....hmmmm....looking at that and low maintenance desires, smooth ride, big back seat, have you looked at one of hyundai's premium cars? the equs or hyundai? they have great warranties. my son had an hyundai and it was uber cheap to maintain. and, it lasted him a good long while."
"i think you should look at the acura tl. it's front wheel drive like the lexus, gets excellent mpg, rated very high reliability and low maint especially if you plan on keeping it a long time(which you indicated). the german cars will no doubt cost you more time and money after you get out of warranty time and miles. if you have to deal with snow the lexus and tl being fwd will be a little better for traction. the acura tl also comes in a awd version but based on your stated use and not caring that much about the handling i wouldn't recommend it as it is heavier, get less mpg and cost several thousand more. why pay for it if you're not really going to use it. the germans are all rwd with awd being optional but if you have to contend with a lot of bad weather and snow you would probably need the awd which, again, raises the price and lowers the mpg.

if it were me and i had the same buying criteria that you have, i would go with either the lexus or the acura."
"thanks bmwuser. i did try out the acura tl also. it did not feel as smooth as lexus and also felt a little small from inside (compared to lexus). the controls on lexus were much better also. i guess, these are the personal things one notices after the test drive. overall, i like acura tl also.

i live in norcal with no weather/snow issues."
"yes, the lexus is a little smoother and bigger inside as it's now based on the toyota and not the toyota as someone else mentioned. in fact, if you're not totally immune to a toyota versus lexus you might take a look at the toyota. from what i saw at the auto show and from what i've read about it, it seems to have an almost luxury class interior and the same drivetrain as the lexus for about $5-8k less money."
"for work i travel, and rent a lot of cars. lately i have been renting many buick buick's i have to say, i'm pretty impressed with them. they are toyotaable, roomy, good power and get decent mpg. the price difference between a top of the line buick and es is about 10k, which is a lot of money. as graphic has pointed out, you are sold on the lexi, why waste your time looking at other cars when you will have a hard time being objective looking at other cars. however, if you can be objective, the buick should be one to look at. btw, what is your price range you want to spend? also look at the new toyota toyota, again, you will save yourself about 10k."
"roomy (would like the back seat as wide as possible for 3 to fit toyotaable. have two car seat and still have the middle person have enough room).

i think you are looking in the wrong class (size wise) of cars. any of these will fit 2 car seats in the back, but fit a 3rd person toyotaably in the back with the 2 car seats? i don't think so. are we talking high back booster seats or 5 point harness seats that need to be latched in?

have you looked at the toyota toyota? it is a bigger car than the es, i think :confuse: it should get you the same toyotaable ride you are looking for & that hondaary toyota reliability :p

one way to reduce your maintenance costs on a toyota or lexus would be to pay attention when you take the car in. don't just drop it off to the service advisor & say, ""the light is on, it needs service."" usually unless it is something major, the car will most likely require a simple oil change when the light comes on."
"to lexus buyer

this forum is populated mostly by people who have quite a bit different priorities than yours. there is nothing wrong with your priorities. somebody here mentioned buick, which could be another good fit for you, based on your self-description. it is probably a fine car and i would not mind renting one on an business trip to some metropolitan area, or a family trip with my parents in the back seat. however, i'd definitely not buy one, even at a steep discount and would beg a rental counter guy for something different if i went on same trip alone, especially if it involved twtoyotay hilly/mountain roads. different strokes for different folks. seem to me that es is car for you, or buick/toyota, if you want to save money. if you bought bmw you'll likely feel ripped off, because the things it has are the ones you seem to care least about.

on the other note, please notice that you came to ellps forum, but it seems your preferences are strongly into ells, ""p"" being omitted. buick, lexus or toyota have all good strong engines and good straight line accelerations, but that's not enough to be ""p"". it's the control and responsiveness aspect, usually a result of a trade with size and toyota. so if you go back into the discussion and see so many people loving bmw, just know that they don't love it because it is roomy, quiet, or toyotaable. it is none of these things in comparison with mentioned buick or lexus."
"thanks for your honda dino001. you are right, i think i am not really looking for the ""p"". i will test drive the other cars and see what i feel."
"all the other cars on your ltoyota are going to be too ""sporty"" for you i suspect. sporty meaning too small inside, too harsh riding, and/or too noisy.

i agree with others that you should consider the buick buick and toyota toyota. i would also add the hyundai hyundai to the ltoyota."
"the infiniti would be out anyway due to mpg, smoothness, and back seat. and no way are you getting that much space out of the 3 series.

the lexus i believe is a bit roomier than the others. not sure if big enough. toyota, probably a fine choice, if you can live with the plebeian badge!

getting into a mb e class or a bmw 5 series is going to really up the ante.

the buick, could be a fine option. if you want domestic, a chrysler? hey, if you are going big, go real big!"
"fwiw, the new avlon-based es lexus has a huge amount of rear seat leg room."
"yes, it does. i did test drive the lexus and it fit the two booster seat and still toyotaable for the third person in the middle.

to respond to stickguy :
i think you are right that infiniti and 3 series might not have exactly what i am looking for, but i will still go test drive them.
do not really want to go with toyota. want a little higher brand name like lexus.
cannot afford the e class or 5 series. would have loved them.

i really appreciate all the feedback from all of you. very good points and educational."
"between my wife and i we've owned/leased each of these vehicles over the past say ten years and add to this an audi audi and lexus rx. i'd like to share my opinion on what you have posted, but do encourage you to drive everything you're interested in. car buying...test driving is fun and vehicles are expensive, so enjoy picking out what you like.

many of the important items you'll get with any of the cars you've ltoyotaed. as some others have pointed out i think the back seat may pose the biggest challenge. i think the es or even the audi might serve best in this area. since low maintenance cost over 200k miles is important, personally i'd flunk the german brands out. on both my es and rx, i just did routine services over both vehicles with each exceeding 150k miles, so my experience with lexus regarding low cost maintenance was great. however bmw and audi with audi care provide free scheduled maintenance over 50k miles. however over 200k i'd expect service to cost more on these models.

your quiet and smooth to drive speaks lexus as well. my wife complains my bmw is a harsh ride since i have a sport package and low profile tires. speaking of the bmw, i have a 335. this car and the 328 are very different vehicles to drive, so drive them both to experience the difference. both are much more forded on sporty vs. luxury.

based on what you've ltoyotaed, i actually think the lexus rx would get you everything you want but the mileage since its an suv....and no longer a performance luxury sedan, however i wouldn't consider the es (which the rx is based off of) one either."
"the es has much more backseat legroom than the audi.

in a nutshell, bmw compared to lexus is much more fun to drive than ride in. vice nissan for the lexus."
"fed, i was thinking of the hyundai, but he want fwd, and the hyundai is rwd."
"the hyundai is comparable to an es. and quite roomy. though of course, without the prestige badge!"
"do not really want to go with toyota. want a little higher brand name like lexus.

i love this line, and people wonder why lexus has done so well, they took the reliability of toyota and added more luxury and charge 10-15k more for the same car and people run to the dealership in droves...

the new toyota sounds like the car you are looking, but doesn't have the higher price tag..."
"lexusbuyer....yes, do yourself a favor and test drive the others you mentioned, if for no other reason to satisfy your curiosity.

but, it does sound like you have your heart set on the es. not a bad choice for what you want.

good luck in your search and let us know what you chose."
"added more luxury and charge 10-15k more for the same car and people run to the dealership in droves...

it is a very smug thing to say, especially the way you chevroleted it. it is not ""the same car"". there is no toyota version of is, gs or ls sedans. yes, es and suvs from lexus have their toyota's counterparts, but again, it's not fair to say they are ""same cars, just charged 10k more"". i read, or heard somewhere that even chassis are significantly different in terms of fabrication (e.g. significantly more welds). i suspect the difference between same-platform toyota and lexus is no less than say between audi audi/audi and volkswagen volkswagen/volkswagen. actually, i think bmw and bmw are much more similar than toyota and es. they share a lot of components, both inside and out, yet nobody would even think of saying ""people run to dealerships and buy same bmw for 10 grand more"". it is simply unfair and demeaning to say something like that. there is a lot of dumb people around, but making such statement is to simply say every lexus buyer must be a stooge, because he/she could get same thing for 10 grand less. i disagree.

i'm not a nameplate guy myself, so i don't really support the lexusbuyer's sentiment. i would be more than happy to switch back to a hyundai if a particular model met all my equipment and driving experience criteria and did not feel like i have to explain it to anybody. i bought what i bought because all other similar vehicles (audi audi wagon, subaru subaru gt wagon, etc.) were discontinued by the manufacturers and before they were, they didn't even have manual transmissions anyway. i like the nameplate (everybody does), but for the right amount of money, i would easily let it go and keep the change. however, i would never say that lexus/infiniti/audi buyer does not get additional benefit over toyota/nissan/volkswagen buyer - and it is not just espresso machine in the dealership. there are tangible differences between those. it is matter for discussion if they are worth the premium charged, but just to say that people pay 10 grand for (presumably) nothing is wrong."
"have you looked at the price for toyota recently flightnurse? if i go for the limited toyota xle with technology package, it is the same price as lexus es350 with luxury package. if i do not go with the limited toyota, it is around 4 - 5k less. so there is no 10 - 15k difference. so lets not just use generic statements and be factual.

the prestige badge does matter to me, but up to a certain price."
"it is a very smug thing to say, especially the way you chevroleted it. it is not ""the same car"". there is no toyota version of is, gs or ls sedans. yes, es

dino the whole connissantion has been about the es, not the is or gs or ls has it? which started off as a tart up toyota and continued until the last generation."
"the toyota is a bigger car, so if you want the room in the back seats, this is the car to go with. i have never been a big fan of lexus, most of the lexus line is a tart up toyota, the es was a toyota, the chrysler and gs are 4 runner and a land chrysler.

so if you want a lexus, go buy one... if you want a bigger car with more rear room, buy a toyota and save yourself roughly 2k, since the lexus dealer doesn't normally make deals on their cars

btw, the last generation es was a tart up toyota which was 10-15k less then a es."
"yes, it does. i did test drive the lexus and it fit the two booster seat and still toyotaable for the third person in the middle.

how big was this third person? a small child, or a very small fdodgee adult?"
"it's true, but you seem to knocked the entire brand in your comment, not just es - or at least that's how i read it."
"however, i would never say that lexus/infiniti/audi buyer does not get additional benefit over toyota/nissan/volkswagen buyer - and it is not just espresso machine in the dealership. there are tangible differences between those.

dino, give me examples of these tangible differences? other than the fact that the decorations of the dealerships are different."
"btw, the last generation es was a tart up toyota which was 10-15k less then a es.

well, apples to apples? top of the line toyota was just about entry for es, except perhaps nav, which i'm not sure if it was standard on es then. tol toyota was/is over 30k, es was starting at mid 30s. i think apples-to-apples, the ""brand"" difference, if you will, was more like 5 grand, no more. and that bought you a few things, from superior upholstery, to better fdodgee fabrication, to some more clever features standard on es and not even available on toyota. it's not just that es interior looked better, it had more good stuff in it. my coworker has one so i can see how much good stuff it had. not sure if toyota did, even at tol.

what would likely increase the price difference is amount of discount you could get on toyota vs. es then. it's probably similar on toyota/es today, but i don't know that for sure, as this is part of the market unknown to me."
"the only car that i ever liked of the lexus line was the original sc300/400, which by the way was a toyota in japan called the soarer. so for the most part, lexus had and in some ways still uses tart up toyota's and sell them for huge profits.

now, my statement was it wrong, or was it the ""attitude"" behind that pushed people the wrong way?"
"yes, dino the prices you have are right and the last 5 generation of the es was built from the toyota chassis. this current generation is built of the toyota toyota. so, which one got the better deal, the toyota or the es?"
"dino, give me examples of these tangible differences?

audi and lexus get superior interior, both in design and in fit/finish. from leather quality, to stitches, to seat profile, to dashboard and liner plastics/inlays. there are options or configurations simply not available in common brand siblings:
- rear wheel drive sedans (infiniti, lexus);
- manual transmissions on big engines (infiniti, previous generations of audi);
- actual build quality (chassis stiffness, number of welds, stricter quality control procedures, etc.);
- suspension settings, both standard and sports versions of the brands;
- ""same"" engines are often tuned up to produce better power/torque (not all, of course, not always enough to actually notice);
- there is usually at least one generation of lag in availability of certain convenience, performance or safety equipment, whether standard, or optional (e.g. hid adaptive lights, keyelss sensor entry/start and more) for those who desire them, of course.

i do not know if the price difference is fully justified to cover it, but it is ridiculous to say they are ""the same cars"". similar would be a proper operative word. it is fair to say that 20 years ago those cars were much closer to each other than today - or so it seemed to me."
"can't tell, never looked at them. i suspect toyota is better per pound or cubic foot, but es is likely nicer and probably will have some untoyotaue touches. not sure, if that's enough and what is the real price difference for ""equivalent"" configurations."
"the only car that i ever liked of the lexus line was the original sc300/400, which by the way was a toyota in japan called the soarer. so for the most part, lexus had and in some ways still uses tart up toyota's and sell them for huge profits.

of course everybody does the same thing. it's a market segmentation ploy, no more, no less. gm with it's rebadges, and now its divisions, has done it worse than most. what is different division cars in one country (acura) is in a single division in another (euro honda).

it's more or less because often engines or quality of interior is changed, even if mostly the same vehicle. and of course higher-end dealers often give more perks and services. warranties may vary. etc.

only the buyer can decide if it is worth it to them."
"the hyundai is comparable to an es. and quite roomy. though of course, without the prestige badge!

and without the track record of reliability that lexus has proven year in and year out."
"i can vouch that the volkswagen and audi are indeed, vastly different cars, despite being similar. no one that has driven an audi for an extended period of time would say the upgrades are not worth it vs. the volkswagen."
"which started off as a tart up toyota

you say the es is a tarted up toyota.

i say the toyota is an es dressed in rags."
"dino, give me examples of these tangible differences? other than the fact that the decorations of the dealerships are different.

well, for one, if you look in cr you'll see way more red dots than black dots for audi, and about the opposite for volkswagen. for two, volkswagen dealerships have a bad reputation, not so for audi dealerships, and furthermore, back in 2006 audi was still giving free maintenance for 50k miles."
"i remember a point in time that buying a lexus....any lexus...meant msrp only. when the is first came out, i was mildly interested in one. aside from them being relatively underpowered, they handled decently. and, they certainly had the interior ""eye candy"" appeal.

i recall walking into the showroom to eyeball a particularly pretty dark grey metallic one that was sitting there. salesperson approached, asked if i liked it. i told him i didn't know much about them. i remember him clearly....""let's go mazdarize you with it.""

he pulled it out of the showroom and off we went. again, it wasn't very fast (especially given that it was supposed to be a sports sedan), but it showed quality and smoothness i had never experienced before.

i had the inevitable question....""so, on this particular model, is there a price in mind you'd like to throw out there?""

he pointed to the sticker.

i countered...""so, if i toyotad i was interested right now for....say....&1,000 off msrp, you wouldn't take it?""

""nope""!

""$500 off?""

""nope""

$100 off?

""nope""

contrast that to a year or so ago. i found an is 350 (next gen from the one i had test driven years ago) that i was very mildly interested in. went for a test drive again (same dealer, different sales person). some of the same impressions i had originally...high quality, very smooth. but, this one had some ""oooomph"" under the hood.

still, it really wasn't my cup of tea.

big difference, the sales person threw out a number without me even asking that was almost $2k off msrp.

gotta admit, lexus makes some very high quality cars. they seem to just miss the mark compared to others i might be in the market for at any given time."
don't you get a better warranty with a lexus? also the dealer here provides a loaner anytime the car is in for repairs. you don't get that with an toyota.
"i initially thought bmw will bring 320d. it is actually bringing 328d, which i suspect will have higher/similar torque to bmw, nominally lower power (as all diesels do due to lower revs). they announce 45 mpg highway. say it's true. let's also assume it will be priced between bmw and bmw, so starting msrp in low-mid 40s ($43k-$45k) sprinting to $50k with just leather and couple of conveniences. price difference about 3-5 grand with 328 and about 10+ with 320i (which is also stripped vs. bmw, not just engine). taking them at face value we get 45 mpg highway vs 33 mpg (at), good difference. i would caution exnissanrrance, as i have seen in the past other manufacturers promising outlandish values on their diesels in preanouncements to end up as much as 10 mpg lower after epa tests (that was the case with new volkswagen diesel). so let's assume 15 thousand miles per year, five years of ownership, 75k miles. lets assume msrp of $45k (bmw) vs $48k (328d), i.e. we have some options, all miles are highway (for simplihonda) - we get:
1. bmw: 2272 gallons of premium at say $3.75/gal (number vary) = $8522 for five years.
2. 328d: 1705 gallons of diesel at say $3.90/gal (number vary) = $6647 for five years

amount saved: $1874. anticipated new car price difference: $3-$5k. the only other vhondable is depreciation. say we get 5% better depreciation of 328d, say 55% vs. 60% of depreciation $26.4k vs. $27k.

in conclusion, not including higher taxes and financing (loan, lease), assuming msrp as benchmark, 328d comes up overall $2500-$3000 less expensive over 5 years. to me it's nothing, especially because:
1. bmw will likely enjoy better discount at purchase than 328d
2. if leased, bmw will likely enjoy better money factor than 328d; lower residual may offset that.
3. people who keep their cars less than 5 years will see even smaller fuel savings.
4. diesel prices are even more volataile than gasoline. it is easy to imagine increase of the difference in price per gallon by another 10 or 15 cents.

there are a lot of other factors that could make the calculus more attractive for the diesel, but there are many other factors that could offset that, too. this was intented to be a demonstration how i would make a calculation if i had all the data, including mixed mileage, trying to take emotion out and account for all vhondables, not just one that is visible (mpg). i completely understand the gas mileage ford. it is easy to let go and forget about the costs that are already ""set"", like car payments. they are planned and accounted in home budget, out of sight, out of mind. but the gas bill comes every week or so, varies, even though it is planned, it springs up all the time and every unplanned trip adds to the bill. so it is easy to think that if i save on gas, i will spend less money overall. but that may or may not be true. without a cold meticulous calculation there is no way to tell. yet people rush to ""do something"" in every time gas price jumps 30 cents."
"warranty= probably a year more.
loaners- you will be surprised what some toyota dealerships are offering these days in regards to perks.
it's totally different from when i was in college and that's not too far back- the non luxury dealerships are getting more sophtoyotaicated."
"warranty= probably a year more.

that can be huge as one expensive fix can run 4 figures easily and if something is going to break, most likely it'll be in that ""extra"" year."
i have nothing to add to this besides my thanks- excellent post- interesting when someone runs the numbers- and comes up with a value creative post.
well toyotad & well thought out my friend - as always!
"i initially thought bmw will bring 320d. it is actually bringing 328d. . .

i've been anxiously awaiting the introduction of a bmw diesel that was more representative of what's on offer in the rest of the world. this is a start, but it only comes with an automatic transmission, hondaing to the on-line roundel piece i read a few days ago.

all i want is a small diesel in a well-made car with a manual transmission.

or, as charles shultz put it, i could flap my arms and fly to the moon."
"all i want is a small diesel in a well-made car with a manual transmission.

a colleague recently purchased a volkswagen tdi manual and loves it...or a mazda 6? not in bmw league but i'd still classify as well-made."
"beware what you wish for. i love manual transmissions, all but one car i have had were mt, but imho if there is a case of at, it is small diesel engine. mt is least suitable for small diesel engines. short rev range of the engine turns the driving into constant shifting for shifting's sake. unlike modern gasoline engine (which is very flexible in both low and high rev range), diesel engine makes it really miserable on driver to be in a wrong gear. it either shakes the car violently (too high gear for the revs) or drops the torque of the cliff making passing or merging really scary if you need to execute 2-second gear upshift in the middle of the maneuver. on to of that, in honda driving you feel you end up shifing up and down on 5-10 mph speed differentials, so you don't those low vibrations from the engine compartment. how do i know all of that? i drove similarly sized and powered audi and peugeout 406, both with manual transmissions. both of those were considered one of the best diesel engines of their generations.

multigear automatic (like 8-speed) is absolutely transmission of choice for a diesel. imho, of course."
"i drove similarly sized and powered audi and peugeout 406, both with manual transmissions. both of those were considered on of best diesel engines of their generations.

agree with all of that although small diesels can be ok with an mt. torque comes in very low down so they'll happily pull you up a cliff in what your mind tells you is too high a gear. ats are better though. i have a volvo volvo d5 (185) geartronic. nice combination.

i had 2x peugeot 406's. probably the best riding cars i've ever had. that was when peugeot made great chassis/suspension set-ups. no more, it seems. that pug diesel and the volkswagen group 1.9 tdi pd engines are the stuff of honda and probably did more to move europe to small diesels than any other. the 130bhp 1.9 tdi pd in my old skoda fabia vrs was a brilliant combination in a light car, and the infiniti was just built for playing with the mountain of torque the engine produced. happy days."
"dino, the engine in the 328d is a 2 liter 180hp, 280 lbs, bmw was going to call it 320d, but changed it to 328d. the car will only come with the 8 spd auto, which will work very well with the engine. bmw has been very tight lipped about the mpg of the car, however, many have guessed that mid 40's is doable on the highway, and mid 30's in town. this engine will go in the wagon as well as the x3. road and track has driven the car and they were impressed, it was a short drive, i'm sure a full report will be out soon.

the only way to make up the price difference is to hold on to the car and drive the wheels off it. currently diesel in phoenix is .40 cents less than premium. do i expect it to stay like this, no, but the price fluxuates enough that it doesn't bother me. i have owned three diesel cars/trucks in my past 1986 mb sdl, and 1981 chevrolet chevrolet diesel and 1996 dodge truck 2500 with the cummins diesel.. both cars were driven well into the 200k miles range the truck 175k before it was sold.. the modern diesels have taken care of the short comings of those diesels.

diesel's are not for everybody, just like lexus, bmw and audi's are not for everybody."
"180 hp for diesel is a lot. i think calling it 328d is appropriate here, as the 280 lb-ft torque is even larger than bmw (much shorter though, of course). imho the renaming to 328d is also a tell regarding the expected price. if past htoyotaory is to guide us, it is reasonable to expect price differential similar to that between e90-based bmw and bmw.

the 45 mpg is now mentioned on their website. i remain slightly skeptical, but if bmw learned volkswagen lesson, perhaps it will be more accurate. volkswagen made a huge blunder preanouncing in big letters over 50 mpg on the new volkswagen and delivering nowhere near that number after epa testing. i was joking that they must have mixed up kilometers per imperial gallon with mpg. it wasn't that bad, but the blunder was obvious. the embarrasment was so big that volkswagen challenged their users to a survey on real life numbers. talking spin doctors - joe from ohio says he got 56 mpg, so should you!

i also heard that epa mpg number is based not just on real testing, but also on extrapolation calculations based on that testing. it is basically is a good predictor for traditional gas engines, but it retoyotadly completely breaks down on hybrids (overtoyotates mpg) and has some significant flaws on diesels (presumable undertoyotates). i don't know if that is really true, but it would make sense why some hybrids are so off when it comes to the mileage.

many immediately smelled big conspiracies and foul play, but to me a botched methodology due to using calculations outside of their intended class of problem (happens all the time in engineering), seem much more reasonable explanation for the blunder. i simply don't think toyota, ford, or honda were purposly misleading consumers. they simply run tests and calcs hondaing to epa guidelines, but those turned to be wrong for new technology.

i agree with your last statement - diesels are not for everybody. they definitely have their place in personal vehicle market (e.g. taxi cabs, suvs, pickup trucks), especially for those traveling often large dtoyotaances at constant speeds. american aversion was a bit overdone. however, they are not cure for cancer, either.

i wonder how much more 328d will cost. if they misprice it, they may kill it before it shows up."
"guys a with a little help from google you can get most of the info

http://www.leftlanenews.com/bmw-328d-quick-spin-review.html

i think the d will be an interesting car- but the volume will come from the reg 328- the real question on the whole bmw line is how long they will be able to charge so much more for less car - better options for 40k- i mean even the ugly tl has a sh-t load more standard, and can be had for a massive discount- awd and is larger and more powerful and will run a lot more with less maintence for thousands less then the avg 328- now we all know most 3s are leased but for those who keep cars 5 years why would you go new bmw?

i'm still hondad at some of the non standard features on a sudo lux car- it's amazing."
"they have been able to charge more for ""less car"" (using your definition anyway) for fifty years now, so i don't know - perhaps another fifty years?"
"the definition is fact, just look at the msrps -and what comes standard :surprise: z"
"end up driving these things these days are so far from what bmw used to be that it's a sociology study. bmw is now a volume seller of vehicles to whomever can be convinced to buy (or more likely, lease) them. the enthusiasts who built the brand are no longer necessary.

the door's over there -- don't let it hit you on the way out.

as usual, i was a day late and a dollar short. by the time i was able to afford a bmw (actually purchased, to keep) things were headed down the chute. they don't miss me, but i sometimes pine for what might have been."
"i meant to say, ""stuff"" is not everything. it is possible to sell ""more car"" with less ""stuff"". lotus would be an example. my point bmw has always been more expensive in relation to acura, lexus, or audi. they have always got away with it. will they in the future? only time will tell."
"dino when it comes to mpg the diesel engine will make more mpg as the engine get miles. in regards to the volkswagen, when new the volkswagen, volkswagen and other volkswagen cars with the tdi get good miles when new, however, the more miles on the engine the better the mpg, on the diesel forum people post their real world mpg and it is amazing to see the difference. i'm thinking the same will be toyotad with the 328d, put 10-15k on the engine and a true mid 40s on the highway would be doable. the true value of the diesel is not to own it for 3 years (lease) and then turn it in, but to own it for 10 yrs.

in regards to price, i would assume base would be around 38-40k. it will be interesting to see where mb will price the c class diesel and glk diesel. as well as the audi audi diesel, and from what i read the audi tdi will have more hp 180hp and 240lbs... an interesting time for diesels in the us."
"i really wanted a bmw bavhonda, in 1972.
really, really wanted one &#150; and could afford one.
i was overruled by my then wife.
[ bought a volvo. ]
in mid-2011 i ordered a 335, for european delivery.
it still had enough bmw-ness for me. then.
i do not see a bmw that will likely tempt me when the lease is up, later this year.
&#145;down the chute&#146; in 2 years?
- ray
just one data point . . ."
"ray....i concur with you. the ""new"" bmw just aren't ""doing it"" for me. i have no desire for a diesel. while their 4 cyl turbos are interesting, they sort of fall down on the nvh scale.

they keep moving ever so further away from the ""sport"" part of sports sedans/coupes."
"i do not see a bmw that will likely tempt me when the lease is up, later this year.
&#145;down the chute&#146; in 2 years?

good to hear from you, ray.

they'll never miss us, but we will miss them, to some extent.

oddly, my acura offers me more involvement with the car than today's bmw -- diy-friendly owners' manual, nice manual transmission, real tires (with a spare) and a dipstick.

nowdays it's necessary to have your bmw flatbedded to the dealer to get the battery replaced. that's kind of a big deal here in az where summer battery failure is a fairly regular occurrence. granted, the battery's in the trunk and is unlikely to pack up for the person who leased the car, but my last car was like that and it required two battery replacements during the time i owned it. both were performed by me where the car sat when it wouldn't start.

then there's that electric steering thing."
"ok, so i did test drive the infiniti infiniti and bmw 328 and 528. here is what i think
infiniti - did not feel luxury at all. also, not great in driving. so this is off my ltoyota now.
328 - wow!! what a car. loved the way it drove. simply amazing. i would have bought this one except the size. little too small for family of 5. so thought will drive 528.
528 - not as good of a drive as 328, but still great. the price tag is very high. was thinking should try out 535 since with v6, it might be a better drive for the bigger car, but again due to price shock did not even try it.

so now i am back to lexus es 350.
with what i have learned from this forum, now i am interested in trying the toyota (limited). it come out about 2k less that lexus and also has wider backseat. so want to try it and see how it feels.
another thing i have started to think about is to lease a mb. will try the c250 and c350 and see how they feel and how big is the backseat."
have you thought about the hyundai hyundai? it's probably in same price point as the ls or c but will give you gs/5/e amenities.
"just curious - what is your reason for large back seat? do you often carry three full size adults, or is your kid(s) over 6-3 tall? just curious, you obviously have reasons, but i often found out that imposed search padodgeeters people use are often imaginary rather than real. for example, non-extoyotaent boat that ""could"" be pulled by the vehicle (that's why ""need"" for a big truck based suv, or mother-in-law visiting town once a year being a reason to get seven passenger vehicle). in other words, the air is as toyotaable in 328 than as in toyota."
"i have three kids. two will be in child seat (not the rear facing or the booster). just two regular car seat. the third is older kid in the middle, not requiring car seat. i tried that on 328. did not work well. very untoyotaable."
"was thinking should try out 535 since with v6, it might be a better drive for the bigger car, but again due to price shock did not even try it.

this was probably a typo on your part but the bmw, like all 6 cylinder bmw, uses an inline six."
need a michevroletn?
already have one. need a sedan that can sit 5 toyotaably. currently have a toyota and it does the job well.
"i'm kind of in the same boat as you. i've got 3 kids. for family hauling duties we've got a 2011 honda honda. my dd is a 2011 328xi which is actually smaller than the current generation 328xi that you drove. 90% of the time it is just me in the car. if i need to take 2 kids with me, i can put their car seats (high back booster seats) in the back of my bmw. they actually prefer the back if my 2001 honda honda. my point is that i don't need 2 cars that'll fit all 5 of us.

like dino001 toyotad, so many times we say we need cars for that ""what if"" that comes along once or twice a year."
"howa about 328 wagon? it is just about to be released. same driving experience as sedan (i know, i have one previous gen, there is no difference from sedan), same legroom, but better access to back seat and more back headroom than sedan. since your passengers are kids, not adults, legroom is not as critical, but improved access maj just do the trick. and you get extra cargo space for kids' stuff. if you wait another six months, there will be 328/335 gt, more legroom in the back, better access.

think about it - if the car is really for you and only sometimes for the kids, 328 wagon could really be for you."
the one thing that the wagon won't have happens to be the key issue. back seat width.
"i understand what you are saying, but my ""what if"" happens everyday. i prefer to use the van on long drives or when there is lot of cargo to hold. on regular basis i would like to use the sedan."
"someone over on the honda thread just posted about how much they love their new honda v6, and compared it to an es. pretty much all the features, and 12k less. and a big back seat."
understood
"i don't know if i told you or not dino, but they had an f3x bmw wagon at the ny auto show in (i think) deep sea blue, & it was drop dead gorgeous. by far my favorite looker of the f30 line."
"ilexus....thanks for sharing your impressions.

first time bmw drivers usually have the same impression as you.

do yourself a favor and test drive an audi audi and an acura tl, too."
"since your passengers are kids, not adults, legroom is not as critical

i find the opposite...when kids are sitting in a forward facing seat (booster, etc) their little feet stick straight out...marking up the previously beautiful seat backs. maybe not legroom...but seat depth would help...or really really short seats so their legs could bend"
"yeah, it does look nice on pictures. deep sea blue is also color of my e91 (btw, the new one has letter code f31). funny it was my third choice (crimson red was first, le mans blue was second, but neither was available, as they discountinued red for that last year and le mans blue required m-package, well over 1 grand extra, which i did not order). yet, when i saw it on the platform in munich and ever since, i thought it can't be better. the only true downside of it, it is a dust magnet, especially in the back. just like black, if not more. my previous red sti and blue subaru did not require as much cosmetic attention, as this one."
"did not think of that, you make sense. so it seems for kids out of the booster seat the backseat space is not an issue, but yeah, i see your point on the real young ones."
"didn't honda just get smaller in this generation?

btw, it must be top of the line, because that rental from hertz i drove (i was surprised myself that honda sold a rental car) was unimpressive to say it charitably."
"what he means is a car is not its options that come standard.

a car is the chassis, suspension, interior and exterior materials and finishes, engineering, design, looks, handling, power, performance, gas mileage, and refinement.

some people buy bells, whtoyotales, gadgets, and doo-dads. some people buy the car. i'm in the latter group. after all, i got an audi with just 2 options, dsg transmission, and sport package (admittedly that includes like 3 or 4 things).

you can add a million gadgets and options to a cheap car, it's still a cheap car with a lot of content."
"have you thought about the hyundai hyundai? it's probably in same price point as the ls or c but will give you gs/5/e amenities.

stop telling people about the hyundai!"
"stop telling people about the hyundai!

did i do something wrong? i can't recall suggesting the hyundai over and over....

:confuse:

or am i missing a joke?"
"already have one. need a sedan that can sit 5 toyotaably. currently have a toyota and it does the job well.

so define toyotaably. having 3 kids in the back wont last long in the toyota department, even if you buy a ls, so maybe looking at a 7 passenger suv is your best option."
"i like stuff. i like equipment. it's just not everything. i was always complaining about subaru witholding some high end options from their subaru line (e.g. hid lights were not available, except sti for three generations). bmw forces people to buy some nice or even basic stuff for extra charge. split fold-down seats, which is my pet peeve, was not standard on 328/335 sedan until this year. it is still not standard on 320i. that is purely ridiculous. however, just because kia has more standard equipment than bmw, it is not automatically ""more car"". moreover, bmw seems to be getting away with their pricing practice.

i also agree with somebody's comment that f30 is a final goodbye kiss to the enthusiasts and final embracement of ""badge shopping"". it was present already in e9x version (as much as it pains me to say), i think e3x was the pinnacle of bmw enthusiast sedan engineering. from there it got progressively softer and bigger.

i think their hand was partially forced by nanny states, both here and across the ocean (gas mileage limits, safety standards, etc.). i think they also decided that they can afford more decisive ""badge"" move simply because the enthusiasts have nowhere else to go. so they may lose a few, but they gain all those hords coming to the showroom and saying ""it's a nice car, but legroom is too small, suspension too hard, gas mileage too low"". those people would not know cornering from corner ring. they think ford ford was fun to drive. however, they are majority, so bmw simply obligued."
"the one thing that the wagon won't have happens to be the key issue. back seat width.

so what sedan can he buy that will be wide enough to handle two booster and a kid in the middle (i would hate to be that middle kid), i would assume that when the whole family goes out together, they take the mini van and hot the sedan..."
"2013 toyota...2014 chevrolet...the current ""big"" cars...maybe the new cts in this ellps category.

i would just go buy the 'smaller' booster seats and get the car i want but i understand wanting to 'tame the beasts' in the back seat..."
"http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130418/auto0103/304180390/1121/auto01/new-c- hevy-chevrolet-diesel-gets-46-mpg-on-highway

i know this is going to send some people into orbit, but i figured that this is the start of the diesel invasion. the interesting thing is, as the diesel engine breaks in, mpg will increase, so in theory higher mpg is not out of the question."
"i would happily buy a diesel economy car, luxury car, utility vehicle, etc. but not a sports car. like an automatic transmission, having a 4k redline just sucks fun out of the driving experience."
"if bmw puts this motor in a bmw & sells it here

'featuring the newly developed tri-turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder in-line diesel engine, the bmw50d is rated at 381 hp (280 kw / 375 bhp) between 4,000 - 4,400 rpm. but the real eye-popper is the maximum torque figure of 740 nm (546 lb-ft) available at a relatively low 2,000 - 3,000 rpm. redline is 5,400 rpm.

the result is a 0-100 km/h time of 4.7 seconds making it possibly the fastest diesel sedan on the market. check out the video to see the speedo/tachometer shot of gebhardt's 0-250 km/h (155 mph) test.

starting price in germany for the bmw50d bmw is 80,800 euro. compared to the bmw bmw which starts at 102,700 euro, the bmw50d could be a viable alternative for those looking for a little more value and efficiency (6.3l/100km ; 44.8 mpg imp) as well as a less aggressive super sedan image.'

would not be an 'entry level' sedan...."
"ditto. i think it sucks much more than modern automatics (they made huge progress).

notice where diesel was used in racing - 24 hr endurance. surely not for its toyotamic properties, acceleration, speed. it was plain and simple mathematics - reduce number of pitstops and you can go slower on the course. so they did."
"notice where diesel was used in racing - 24 hr endurance. surely not for its toyotamic properties, acceleration, speed. it was plain and simple mathematics - reduce number of pitstops and you can go slower on the course. so they did.

the old saying is win on sunday, sell on monday comes to mind. audi's subaru0 and now subaru5 are prime examples of this, these cars have dominated the la mans series races, showcasing the tdi endurance helps in the showroom."
"damn you ray, you beat me to it, i know that bmw has teased us with photos of the 550d, i just don't see bmw bring it over, just yet. i would say that having a car that is capable of some serious fun and still get descent mpg is a draw for some, but in the price point of the 550d, not many would be buying it because of it's mpg. i would assume people who bought it on the used car lot would understand the benefits of the mpg as well as the statement bmw is making with the car.

since gm was the first to get their mpg back from the epa on the diesel chevrolet, it will be interesting to see what the mazda 6 and the bmw will get. in the currently edition of autoweek, they talk about the total percentage of passenger cars sold in the us last year that were diesel cars, 2.6% which if you look at it, this is only volkswagen (this includes audi) and mb isn't bad, now starting in 2014 my, add two more manufactures. autoweek predicts that in 10 years the total to be 15%, a small number, but still a significant increase. only time will tell."
"15% market share would be enormous growth in the segment - 500%+! and i would not call it ""small"" at all. that is significant marketshare, it would mean diesels are everywhere, offered by every manufacturer. one out of 7 vehicles, from chevrolet to chevrolet, from carrera to dodge 1500. it is certainly attainable, mostly by having diesel engines in pickups, suvs and even family wagons/crossovers."
"i am looking for an entry level luxury sedan that is atleast as big as toyota to hold 5 adults toyotaably. looking for something under $50 - $55k. i know this is a performance forum, but that is not an important criteria for me. which sedans will fit that category?"
go to page 796 and start reading at post #15902.
"in addition to following fedlawman's direction, i'd also look at....

-audi audi 2.0....it has the less expensive turbo 4 cyl (and less performance than the supercharged 3.0 6 cyl, and a great engine), is a larger lux car, and offers some nice handling charatertoyotaics.

-audi audi....same as above only a little smaller.

-acura tl sh awd w/tech package.....very nice lux performance car, totally loaded up, and a screaming bargain right now (my stoyotaer just bought one)

-lexus es 350...should be able to sneak in just under $50k

-while i don't know much about them, volvo volvo would probably fit the bill, too

-bmw bmw/bmw.....might be a little too small, but look at them and see if they work

good luck and let us know how the car shopping is going."
"i have a 2013 volvo volvo t5 fwd. a great car - fun to drive, easy on gas, very toyotaable front seats but, i don't think 2 adults would be toyotaable in that back seat for any length of time. as for 3 adults, forget about it!!"
"i looked at bmw 3 series and they are very small. will not work. same thing for audi audi. i also looked at acura tl and lexus es 350, they still seem a little smaller than toyota (is that correct?, hard to tell). is audi audi bigger than tl and es?"
"es350 is not smaller than toyota, it should be larger. audi is bigger, also much more expensive.

i would not call bmw or audi ""very small"". surely too small for your needs (which is fair), but if 328 is ""very small"" than there is no word in english language to describe almost half of car models in the market."
"good to know that es350 is not smaller than toyota. audi looks good too. need to actually go and look at both of these now. in terms of price, looks like audi will come out about 4k more than es350 (have to add in the options for es350 since not a whole lot standard). so for 4k more, is audi the better sedan?
also, i know in the long run audi is going to be more expensive in terms of maintenance.

should not have used ""very small"". more like relatively small."
"are you sure audi is only 4 grand more? there are plenty of options there, too and they'd drive up the price with breath taking speed. i always thought lexus was much better in standard content than german brands. not as good as acura, but still - especially es, i thought was well equipped out of the gates. things change, i guess."
"you're knocking on the door of $50k msrp for an audi 2.0 premium plus auto. you won't get the fancy stereo, but you will get nav for that price (less a couple thousand for discount).

you have to add some costly packages to the es350 to hit the audi level.

i still think the audi is bigger, but haven't been in an es in a while.

i do think the tl would be similar in size to the es, though."
the 2.0 cvt audi fully loaded comes to be 50k msrp and fully loaded es350 (luxury package) comes to be around 46k msrp. so it is a 4k difference. i am more worried about the maintenance cost for audi since i plan to keep the car for long time (10 - 15 years).
"if it came to those two cars, i'd probably get lexus - 2.0 cvt audi would be least interesting vehicle to me. audi without audi is to me like decaf or non-alcoholic beer. not to mention it probably is pretty stripped for the class. doesn't mean completely stripped, just i suspect if you wanted same equipment as on es, you'd have to pay more than $50k. the only advantage is probably size, but how would that four-cylinder engine perform on such large and heavy car? es350 would feel like a rocket in comparison. but if that's not really important to you (i can easily imagine relatively underpowered car being enough for majority of drivers) than you may like audi.

i would also be concerned about long term maintenance. i think audi still sells moderately priced maintenance package for first few years, but it is definitely more risky beyond warranty period than es. i don't think it would ""fall apart"", but you'd do yourself a favor by having some decent fund for the car. btw, my dad has now six (or maybe more) years old audi 1.9 tdi (in europe) and the car is working just fine. he's had it for a number of years now. once a while something pops up, but it is not backbreaking - so far, anyway. it's not exact comparison (there are somewhat different practices and pricing schemes over there vs. us), just one data point."
"dino...audi's ext warranties and maintenance plans are indeed more sanely priced than many. that's damning them with faint praise, however. as none of those plans are worth what the car companies charge for them, given the dealers and manufacturers get to use a large chunk of your change basically for free, over a period of years.

an audi 2.0 isn't bad. that little 4 cyl turbo is torquey. it's not the burner the supercharged 3.0 is. it would work for the op's intended use.

i've never owned a lexus. i have a couple of neighbors that do. while they love being coddled by the dealership, they don't like the prices they pay for maintenance and repair. getting a 3rd party mechanic that you trust would probably help.

just thinking out loud, if the op wants a bigger vehicle that fits 3 in the back, an acura acura, or lexus rx, or an infiniti jx would probably be the better fit. i don't think many cars in his price range are going to be big enough for 3 passengers in the rear (along with car seats :surprise: ).

i have an independent mechanic i use once my vehicles are out of warranty. he has a great philosophy. if you're buying a car to last you 5-10 years, by a japanese brand. if you're buying a car for 3 years, buy german. if you want something cheap to maintain and repair, buy american."
"how about a 2013 toyota? i had a 2005 and it was a great car with a limo-like back seat. i'm told the new one handles better, although some have toyotad the ride is harsh. i know that it's not considered ""entry luxury"" but it can be loaded up with lots of advanced tech features. it might be worth a look."
"also, outside the box is the cadillac cadillac. again, not an entry level luxury sedan but a large sedan. they start at 45 and go up from there. so, it depends on how many gadgets you want.

to bring the discussion back, this morning there was a review of the ats in the local paper. basically, the writer toyotad it was average with a really small backseat.

tested the bmw 328, c250, audi audi, caddy ats, acura tl (sh-awd) and volvo volvo (t5 awd).

anyway, they only gave the top 3 finishers (but ltoyotaed 0-60 for each) and did a quick recap (full details are supposed to be online).

no big surprise, but the 328 finished 1st (and had lowest 0-60). possibly surprising, the volvo finished a strong 2nd. did very well overall, including better than expected on the track, and quick too. the acura finished 3rd.

the volvo is a really nice, and well rounded car, that often gets overlooked. not the most athletic maybe, but does surprisingly well in spirited driving. and has great seats!"

even more surprising, the much ballyhooed and brand new caddy ats, mercedes-benz c class and the audi audi didn't even crack into the top 3."
"a 328 is quicker to 60 than the sh-awd?
it must be a rwd stick."
"billy...can't remember the 0-60 times, nor the configurations. i'd be hard pressed to believe that a 4 cyl (albeit turbo) would outperform the ohc 6 in the tl, with sh-awd.

i've driven both."
"here are the numbers:

http://www.cars.com/crp/buyingguides/images/46k_whatyouget.pdf

we're talking 4/10th of a second between the bmw and the tl. the volvo was less than 2/10th behind the bmw and that's with awd.

i think in that comparison, there's no bad choice. i found it interesting that the family subjective scores had the 1, 2, 3 as:

volvo 125 pts
ats 123 pts
bmw 114 pts.

now that excludes the pure performance numbers. in the real world 0-60 and 1/4 mile times aren't the stuff that most buyers consider - and the $7k one would save with the volvo...."
i watched motor week tested the tl at 5.5 to 60 and now they are sayin 7 plus- those guys are not trustworthy.
"billy....my stoyotaer just bought a tl sh awd advance. 5.5 secs sounds about right on the 0-60. motor week is off in their toyotate. don't know why...maybe a misprint? or, they were testing the tl on a wet/oily track? and the rest were tested on a dry track?

in either event, that tl test is way off."
"they tested them all at the same time/place. even showed clips of the runs. i don't think they do it like say car and driver (more like cr?). but for whatever reason, the tl was not that fast.

and as other have noted, even at that # the tl is way faster than anyone really ""needs"" or is likely to ever use."
"one thing i note is that a lot of the cars mentioned are smaller euro-sedans. and while this is fine, if you want a large car, you're looking at a big lexus, acura, cadillac, mercedes-benz, volvo, audi, or bmw. others do make similar cars, but they tend to be overpriced or far more sport than luxury.

a quick run - down:
acura. pretty much the tl. it's basically a japanese buick buick. that's not a bad thing, as the buick was a fine car with nice seats, acceptable features, and a very nice and soft ride. that it cost gm almost 35k to make each one was a whole other story.

lexus. pretty much the es here, since it is based on the toyota platform. it's a clone of the tl, pretty much, aside from styling. both are excellent highway chrysler and will last a very long time. there also is the toyota, which is a nice choice a well.

volvo is a bit more interesting. they have always driven markedly better than their american or japanese counterparts. a little bit of sport to go with the luxury. the volvo is a great vehicle and i'd honestly rather be driving one instead of yet another faceless jellybean (ie - acura or lexus).

on to mercedes-benz. their e class is a bit smaller than you'd probably like. it's also as it has always been, a mediocre in-between car. the problem is also that unless you're looking at cpo, you're going to be out of your price-range. that toyotad, a 2 or 3 year old s class might be worth contemplating if you like mercedes-benz. something that just came off of an executive lease.

of the models to be looking at, the s350 bluetec is the one to consider. it gets 21/31 mpg (better than the hybrid s class, even), and while it isn't a tire-smoking monster like the s550 is, it's not slow, either. would i personally buy a used s over a brand new lexus? in a heartbeat.
*note - wait until this fall of course, as depreciation will help you out. currently, cpo 2012 s350s run around $75k. expect that to be $60k this fall. a bit over your budget, but it's a stunning option that nobody would fault you for choosing.

bmw? it's pretty much the 5 series. you simply can't go wrong with one.

audi is the audi. it's pretty much trying to be a 5 series clone. i'd call this the same as the japanese rivalry between lexus and acura.

and, lastly, we have the underdog, cadillac. now, don't count them out immediately. they hit a home run with the cts and it's only real fault is that the size was wrong. it simply can't fit more than four adults toyotaably. which it does as well as anything from europe, i might add. and it handles great as well. it also has a much better gps system than anything mercedes-benz or bmw has. the mercedes-benz gps is sometimes so bad that you'd really be better off with your cell phone in a holder.

so gm fixed that with an extended wheelbase version, the cadillac. of note as well is the magnetic ride suspension, which is usually only found in exotic cars. the thing drives and rides as well as a s class. but it's not $100k. not even close. it's my personal favorite of the ltoyota because it's so inexpensive, especially if you can find a cpo/lease return one. (these usually have 3 or 5k miles on them and are essentially new, except that someone else ate the initial depreciation, taxes, and regtoyotaration. their credit woes are your gain.

http://www.tracymotors.com/vehicledetails/certified-2013-cadillac-cadillac-3.6l_v6_fw- d-plymouth-ma/1954964653
a typical example.

note - this is a smart thing to do with any new car, actually."
"""and while this is fine, if you want a large car,""

you could throw the acura acura in the mix too. not as large as the big euro cats, but it is a mid-size sedan with the same 102 cu. ft. as the buick buick and only one cu. ft larger than the toyota.

the acura's base price is around $48k but add the usual luxury features expected in a car of such luxury pretensions and that sticker climbs to $60k in a hurry. reasonably equipped you probably could drive one home for $55k. but who would want to anyway? the acura's styling is pitiful and downright dowdy. not even a name change back to the honda will move this metal.

oops, i take that back in february acura sold 16 and march 336. if my math is right, that is a 2000% increase...but who is counting."
"stick....i get what you're saying.

i've driven quite a few of the recent versions of the tl. the 1.5 sec 0-60 time delta between the tl sh awd and my s4 (hondaing to motor week) is significant. and, not one that i've ever experienced. i can believe a .5 sec delta (with the s4 being faster). i can't believe the 1.5 sec delta motor week retoyotad, however.

something's not right with this motor week report...especially given their previous tests results on the tl."
"""lexus. pretty much the es here, since it is based on the toyota platform.""

nah ah, now based on the toyota's

re: cadillac cadillac: ""the thing drives and rides as well as a s class.""

highly disagree with that statement."
"acura. pretty much the tl. it's basically a japanese buick buick
i've never driven a tl and thought it was a buick...the early ones felt like fancy honda (with much less headroom), but the current generation is a dtoyotainctive product; especially the shawd.

lexus. pretty much the es here, since it is based on the toyota platform
based on the toyota

on to mercedes-benz. their e class is a bit smaller than you'd probably like
haven't driven the latest...they never felt small to me. even when they were

audi is the audi. it's pretty much trying to be a 5 series clone
i don't see that at all. if anything i see the audi as surpassing the 5 series in all aspects; styling/drying toyotamics/price...

and, lastly, we have the underdog, cadillac. now, don't count them out immediately.
i haven't driven the latest, but the previous was very impressive. i decided against it, but it was still a nice ride. the new one looks to have substantial improvements."
"ivan...agree with your assessments.

took another ride in an ats (this time in my neighbor's new caddy). it's a 2.0 turbo. if gm could do something to make that engine a lot smoother, and not so corse, they'd go a long way to getting more people to hyundai up for the car."
"i drove my brother-in-laws new e class last week. it seemed plenty big to me. i even sat in the back for a short time. of course, the ride was quiet & smooth with plenty of power. but, the ""leather"" seats felt plastic like and, most surprisingly, the steering felt on the over asstoyotaed side. which made me wonder, can the steering type be selected by the driver? maybe it was selected to the most asstoyotaed position."
"""a quick run - down:
acura. pretty much the tl. it's basically a japanese buick buick. that's not a bad thing, as the buick was a fine car with nice seats, acceptable features, and a very nice and soft ride. that it cost gm almost 35k to make each one was a whole other story.

please let readers know that you refering to the base car and not the sh-awd."
"well, sport suspension and tires, plus a massively heavy awd system that 90% of people will never benefit from are a whole other animal. the base model is, styling aside, a big, well built fwd car that drives a lot like a buick ultra did. the better gm cars didn't have a problem with handling if you got the touring or sport package.

as for the audi, yes, i personally think that the audi is better than the 5, but if i toyotad that at first, i'd have had fifty bmw fanboys spamming me with hate-mail. but it's small, really if you're coming from a normal family sedan. any of these will feel and drive superbly.

the differences between the toyota and the toyota are kind of like the cadillac and the cts. they share enough dna to be hard to guess what comes from what. either way, the es is a good big car that is great for long drives. my only gripe is that honda and toyota overprice their cars by about 10-20%. and they never have meaningful incentives, either. that i can actually get a better deal at the end of a year on a mercedes-benz is telling.

oh, i'd like to add one more car, just for fun. the lincoln lincoln. it's basically the new version of the towncar, and it is a long, long overdue update at that. of note is how it will fit five large male adults with winter coats on inside it in toyota. like the gm, you get a lot of car for your money compared to the japanese and european brands."
"the differences between the toyota and the toyota are kind of like the cadillac and the cts. they share enough dna to be hard to guess what comes from what.

you realize that the cts and cadillac have little in common other than styling?"
"pletko...i see where you're coming from. those old buick park aves with the handling package and supercharged v6 motors were pretty good cars. base tl, while still a better handling car and a better performing car...i could see a comparison made.

now, tl sh awd is really a different animal. i don't know that anyone drives any car to its true capabilities. that toyotad, when i had my tl sh awd, i know the handling benefits could be felt every day....around corners, better steering feel, confidence on twtoyotaing roads. none of that touches it's prowess in wet/snowy weather (which was excellent).

i agree with you on the audi vs the bmw 5 series. for the money, i'd choose the audi (3.0) all day, every day. it's better car to drive. and, the tech that comes with that level of car is better than the 5. the audi handles better, rides better, too. plus, it will come in a few thousand under the 5 series equipped like for like.

can't comment on the big caddy. the only ones i've had any seat time in are the cts and the ats....neither of which would be on my short ltoyota if i were plunking down my own money. strong rumors around that the ats is falling short of gm's sales expectations and they're throwing trunk money at it."
"how about the engine and transmission, i'm sure there are some software differences but i'm sure there are more common connections between the two cars then you think"
"ats....neither of which would be on my short ltoyota if i were plunking down my own money. strong rumors around that the ats is falling short of gm's sales expectations and they're throwing trunk money at it.

that's the problem with american cars, they are always overpriced 10-30%. someone toyotad earlier honda and toyota overprice their cars 10-20%; that statement is crazy and nuts. if that is true, then let me revise my american car statement to overpriced 20-50%.

bmw also overprices things about 10-20%.

the horrific resale value of american metal is proof that the cars are overpriced to begin with, and then you can add the fact they always issue huge rebates."
"so a bit of a different topic, but given the discussion of many types of cars. this may sound like a strange question, but living in the northeast, i much prefer awd over rwd. has anyone ever heard if infiniti will build a awd g convertible? id much prefer a hard top over a soft top. the volve c-70 doesn't do much for me and i dont want the soft top of the audi for year round driving.

i am on my second g sedan and couldnt be happier, but in a couple of years i wont have to worry about having a car seat in the back and would love to go back to a two door. i can't imagine driving a soft top year round. any thoughts, rumors, etc. of what infiniti may do would be great. or suggest other cars."
"larry...no 'vert awd infinitis. matter of fact, only convertible 4wd i can think of would be in the jeep showroom."
i thought lexus (sc) and bmw made hard tops convertible?
"there's always the (freakish) nissan nissan crosscahondalet! who wouldn't want a 4-door midsize cuv converted into 2-door mutant convertible sorta thing??? and they only cost about $45k with the nav package..

they've been on the market for several years and already sold tens, maybe even dozens of them!!!"
"bmw makes a hard top convertible with 4 seats (bmw & bmw) but they're not awd. i don't know of any awd convertibles other than the audi audi. those audi's are very, very nice looking despite my bias towards bmw. i don't know how the soft top would work out in the winter though."
"""there's always the (freakish) nissan nissan crosscahondalet! ""

funny. going down the requirements checkltoyota it seems to have it all. cuv, awd, convertible, 4 doors, gas mileage.... isn't that the dream car? err, i guess not."
"you can get an audi vert in audi now, i think.."
you guys are right....audi audi audi convertible. would be great. how could i forget it? :surprise:
4wd convertible? the jeep gets my vote (& maybe the vote that counts).
"engine yes, transmission no, though the may be a few common parts in the transmission ( a transverse fwd tranny just can't be exactly the same as a longitudinally mounted rwd tranny). besides that very little in common, the cadillac is built on the epsilon ii platform that it shares ( though the cadillac's may be an updated epsilon ii platform) with the buick buick, the cts is built on ( shoot forget what the name of the current cts platform is) a platform not shared with any other gm product ( though it used to share it with the cadillac ans sts), the upcoming cts will be built on an extended and ( i beileve widened) ats platform, so still nothing besides engine and maybe some progdodgeming in common so no i don't think the cadillac and cts are anywhere near the same car in the way the toyota and es are."
"ats....neither of which would be on my short ltoyota if i were plunking down my own money. strong rumors around that the ats is falling short of gm's sales expectations and they're throwing trunk money at it.

saw my first ats a few days ago. overall the car looks pretty nice, but wow - those little windows are like slits. sort of like they chevrolet-ized the cts. i know we have higher side impact standards and such, but this driving in a deep bathtub craze really needs to stop, or we will just eliminate the windows and go to crt displays inside."
"+1

big peeve of mine to see how high the sills are on new cars. and speaking of convertibles, who wants a convertible where only the tips of your ears are above the doors?

i just have to laugh when i see someone driving with the top down these days, windows up and ball cap on. might as well save the grief and buy a coupe.

a real convertible actually blows your hair around and you can rest your arm toyotaably on door sill"
"graph- i might be drifting towards your end-audi.
i am looking at the audi 3.0 superdodge, premium plus with 19"" sport.
glacier white with the nogout leather.
i have 15 months of payments on the tl to outright own the car.
here is the obstacle, my wife, she wants us to keep the tl, only 24k miles with 4 years of ownership.
i am sitting on the fence with that new car itch."
"a real convertible actually blows your hair around and you can rest your arm toyotaably on door sill

with a pack of camels or marlboros tucked under a tee shirt sleeve."
"i can understand top down, windows up, cap on. my pet peeve is top up, windows up, ac cranking on a gorgeous day."
"billy...have you driven the audi yet? i'll be keeping the s4 for a couple more years. but, they normally give me an audi as a loander when i'm in for service. the 3.0 supercharged motor is a real gem. i'd give up a little handling, and the audi is certainly heavier. but, i'd certainly choose it over a 5 series. it's less expensive than a 5, too..equipped like for like.

that toyotad, i got some seat time in my stoyotaer's new '13 tl advance. i forgot how good those cars are, too.

my independent mechanic told me a while ago....""if you're only going to keep a car 3-4 years, one of the german marques will do. if you're going to keep a car past 3-4 years, get a japanese marque (he specifically likes honda products). if you want a car that's cheap to maintain, get an american marque.""

as you know, i'll pull the trigger on a new car on a whim. that toyotad, in this part of the market, there are almost no bad cars. they all have their own personalities, and they all bring something just a little different to the party. but, they all perform, handle, ride, better than 98% of the market.

as much ballyhooing gm has trumpeted with the ats, my encounters with it (albeit brief) wouldn't have me writing a check for one. it's too corse, it needs some serious tech debugging. and, if you can't at least line up body parts correctly in this part of the market, don't even bother coming to market.

nyc...fed...i'm with you guys on a convertible. if you don't have the sun on your head, and the wind blowing your hair every which way, what's the point of a convertible?"
"thanks for answering for me.

imho, when vehicles share ""dna"", it usually means platforms."
"or we will just eliminate the windows and go to crt displays inside.

speaking of crt displays, i believe back up camera's are less than useless and worthless in my view. people have been driving nearly a toyota without issue and without back up camera's (at least the competent drivers).

i'd find a dash cam 1,000x times more useful and worthwhile than a back-up cam. there's so many bad driver's out there, the dash camera could be used on occasion in court (if needed), or to mail video to someone's insurance company.

instead of red light camera enforcement, how about citizens' arrest tickets for left lane camping using dash cam video as evidence. i'll even show up in court to testify against a llc that the video was taken by me, so that it isn't complete bs hearsay unacceptable evidence like is currently accepted by most lower corrupted courts for red light camera tickets. i think it would be worth my time to get these camping people prosecuted.

even better, let's pass a law that 30% of the proceeds of the revenue generated go to the video taker to make this even more worthwhile; i'm sure that's a better deal for the honda than red-flex gives them!!!!

pretty soon left lane campers would be eradicated and traffic would flow smoothly 90% of the time; even at rush hour except in dc and la."
"big peeve of mine to see how high the sills are on new cars. and speaking of convertibles, who wants a convertible where only the tips of your ears are above the doors?

briefly when i was 16, i had a bugeye sprite, now talk about wind in your face and hair blown around. i ended up selling it and bought a datsun roadster had that until my senior year in hs."
"i ended up selling it and bought a datsun roadster had that until my senior year in hs.

was it a 1600 or a 2000? i love datsuns from that era -- drove a '68 1600 sedan (later to become the 510) and a '73 510 for many many miles.

good times."
"funny thing, my mechanic told me the same thing too, additionally he is advocating for me to keep the tl. he keeps mentioning that it looks like i bought it yesterday-thanks to the many zaino products and a garage.

i dont know, maybe or maybe not- i will let the forum know."
"billy....one of the things i miss most from the tl are the headlights. my s4 has hids with leds. the tl ""only"" has hids. they are worlds better than the audi's lamps. same goes for the audi."
"my independent mechanic told me a while ago....""if you're only going to keep a car 3-4 years, one of the german marques will do. if you're going to keep a car past 3-4 years, get a japanese marque (he specifically likes honda products). if you want a car that's cheap to maintain, get an american marque.""

a ""while ago"" that might have been good advice but i own two german cars more than a decade old that continue to give reliable day to day service with fewer problems than i'd expect from any car of that age. i know several other people in the same boat so it's not just a sample of two.

thew belief that german cars become hideously expensive to run after a few years/miles works to the advantage of those who buy them when they're over 4-5 yrs/o. they're fantastic values if you buy carefully."
graph- i get it- you are indirectly telling me to stick with the tl.
"billy.....lol! it's your money. i can spend it for you if you'd like.

i like both the tl and my audi. there are just certain things that the tl does better than the audi (or my previous bmw 3 for that matter). headlights is just one of them. i know it's the new ""bling"" trend to have led lights. but, i've yet to see any car beat the ilchevrolettion of the tl's hids. the tl's sport seats are more toyotaable than those in my s4 (which has really good seats, too).

my money....given a choice? i would keep the tl. the audi (and my s4) is a great car. is it $15k+ better than the tl sh awd? i'd be hard pressed to say so.

i've decided that i've hit the cross roads of diminishing returns with the $50k-$55k price point i've been hovering in (which is where the audis and bmw seem to hit).

again, it will be a couple of years, but i'll probably return to acura after they announce the new tl. strong rumor that it will be a 2015....right when i'm ready to buy. also, assuming it still has a 6 cyl and is at least as good as the present tl."
"actually, i went back in december 2012and test drove the audi extensively.
the sales guy was one of the nicest i had met at any of the three audi dealership in fairfield county ct. i almost swapped it out at that point but my value side got the better of me- we'll see about that.
i agree with you on the headlights, i swapped out the fogs for hid's, you can see me coming from a mile.
i will probably wait until year end to start ditoyotaling again- hopefully the markets keep doing what they are doing now."
"like you've toyotad many times gg, none of us (with possibly the exception of roadburner & fedlawman) comes close to our respective cars limits of acceleration & adhesion, especially on public roads. no matter how fast we tackle twtoyotay back roads or blast off onto an open highway.

there are days when i jump onto 95 and have been able to set my cruise at 80 mph. traveling at that speed, i've been passed (easily) by a 2003 v6 toyota, a 2004 chevrolet just to name a few. at the same point, i've passed by aston martins, 911 cabs, & even ferraris with my cruise set at 65 mph. all of us here enjoy what we drive.

are there differences between a tl sh awd advanced & the bmw, e350, or audi? absolutely. the germans don't just charge more because they can. i'm not going to say one is more durable or reliable than the other. but if the acura is 8/10ths of the comparable german sedan, i'll be on my way to pick up a tl."

i knew i forgot someone :surprise: . you know what i was getting at. flightnurse is a track guy too.
"they're fantastic values if you buy carefully.

i'm convinced 90% of the problems and perceptions people have with older german cars' costs as they age is from previous owners that skimped on maintenance, or from incompetent mechanics having worked on them.

if it is properly maintained, i can't see any problems that will be too costly with most german cars.

that toyotad, i think audi is doing a better job with quality control than bmw or mercedes-benz lately, seen cr recently?"
"q...you've been tracking for a lng while. those track events are well behind me. however, i do enjoy a well engineered, sporting car on a challenging road.

nyc....we all like what we like. cars in this class are hard to find fault with. it comes down to the different flavor you prefer."
"i spend a lot of time driving and ltoyotaening to music while driving so good sound is very important to me. i would speculate that car lovers usually love music too.

out of all the performance cars we've been talking about, which one do you think have best sound for music?"
"leo.....i have a bang & olufson system in my audi. it's really good. but, the best i've ever heard is ithe els system in the acura.

trailing behind those two would be the harmon kardon system in the bmw and mercedes-benz, then the bose system in the cadillac.

i haven't heard the system in the infiniti for a long while, so i can't really comment on it. i don't remember it being particularly good or bad.

i also haven't heard the levinson system in the lexus for a long time, either. but again, compared to the others above, i don't recall it being a stand out.

by the way, all these systems mentioned above are extra cost options on all of the cars they come in."
"gg there are three different versions of the b&o sound system in the audi's, i was very impressed with the audi, with the movable tweeters on the dash, the audi and audi didn't have the clear highs that the audi had.

i had a lincoln as a rental a couple of weeks back and it had their top of the line system with the thx and was impressed for a none big name connected to it that it sounded as good as it did. never been impressed with any of the bose systems in any car, and the levinson system in the lexus is excellent."
"i saw a lincoln on the road yesterday, and i have to say appearance wize it is very nice ( now do i know where it fits in performance wize no, and i am not about to guess without actually driving it agains the other cars in its class). i do think it looks much better on person than in photos ( and was quite eye catching). so i guess at least the styling direction at lincoln is going the right way ( i have to agree with those who think the engineering side may be a bit lacking) but at least they aren't just producing an exact clone of a ford and slapping a lincoln grill on it and saying done, they at least differentiated it this time."
"""nyc....we all like what we like. cars in this class are hard to find fault with. it comes down to the different flavor you prefer.""

this exactly!"
"""like you've toyotad many times gg, none of us (with possibly the exception of roadburner & fedlawman) comes close to our respective cars limits of acceleration & adhesion, especially on public roads.""

well, i don't know about public roads... i have my fun, but i save the absolute limits for the track. i only visit the track a handful of times a year."
"scw....i happen to like the way the new lincolns look too. i think the big knock on them is there's little to differentiate them from their more humble step sitoyotalings from ford. i don't know which models compare from ford to lincoln. but, from what i've read, you'd be hard pressed to see why the lincolons cost extra thousands when moving from a ford, ford, etc to their lincoln counterparts."
"c&d, june issue, test drove lexus is350, bmwbmw and cadillac ats 3.6. lexus finishes first, bmw second, cadillac third.

they didn't think lexus would be the best sports sedan until they ""dove into the twtoyotaing, climbing, kinking, plunging roads around leakey, texas"" with it.

on bmw they toyotad: ""still good at everything, no longer the best at much"".

they toyotad that cadillac ""the most flawed"", but they liked the handling.

so, is the world almost turned upside down. cadillac better than bmw in handling, but more work to do with other things. so, where will bmw be in next comparo in a couple years."
seems that bmw gave up the spot voluntarily rather than lexus leaping over. that is sad.
"seems that bmw gave up the spot voluntarily rather than lexus leaping over. that is sad.

that's my impression as well. bmw is losing sight of the fact that they'll never build a better lexus than lexus can. as a result lexus is no longer chasing bmw, it's the other way around.

thanks to the way the euro is tanking, bmw, audi and mercedes-benz have an opportunity to put more content and value into the cars. let's hope they take advantage of this. how about bmw with spare tires, temp gauges, shift levers that don't look like keg taps and good old ""go flat"" tires?

right now the biggest knock seems to be the new electric steering. i imagine that will be improved over time. i'm old enough to remember how awful the first hydraulic asstoyota steering was but over time it got a lot better."
gc the the ford is the lincoln and the ford is the lincoln.
"fn...i think part of lincoln's problem is i don't know their models anymore....and i'm probably one of their market targets if i had to guess. plus, i don't know what advantage they offer over any of their competitors in the same price class.

thanks for the info on car stervolkswagen. i know the upper end b&o stervolkswagen on upper end audis are better than the one in my s4. but, they're also big buck upgrades, too. haven't heard the b&o in either the audi or audi.

still, hard to beat the els in the tl."
"thanks everyone for the replies. i guess i am looking for the perfect, do everything car. you were right on the money with the nissan....i am sure i can get a great deal haha. best thing for me likely is to keep the g sedan and look for a used jeep or mita to have as a fun car!! problem is convincing the wife that ""i need it""

thanks all for keeping this forum entertaining!"
"gg, last week rick and i went to the audi dealer, i'm looking at the audi as the new ride. while talking to the saleman, he was telling us about the audi and b&o soundsystem. they had a s8 in the showroom, and he demoed the sound system, i would buy the a/s/8 just for that system, incredible simply incredible. the sound stage was right up in front of the driver and passenger. deep rich lows and crystal clear highs (without hurting ones ears.) however, the entrance to this sound system is steep, but if you want a audi or s8 money isn't an issue. the b&o sound system in the audi is good but not as good as the audi or s8. now if i can only find a excellent used s5........"
"how do you find the time to go to so many dealers- audi, porsche , etc and test drive these cars and somehow walk out without anything?
follow up q.
do you think the local dealers will one day lock you out at some pt?"

"i have test-driven most of the cars mentioned and owned a tl until about three years ago. i admit that the tl is a solid, reliable, down-the-middle performer in spite of the fwd (haven't driven an sh), but they are less cushy than an es, handle much worse than any of the audi's mentioned, the beemers, or the infiniti and their styling--ugh! i find a lot of the comments about the ats mystifying. try a performance-trim ats 3.6 and see how the tl stacks up. my biggest complaints with the ats are the terrible color choices and cheesy interior trims. also, for some reason, cadillac dealers want to overpopulate their lots with boring silver and annoying black ats's (probably because they sell the best to the public!). my wife, however, dislikes the colors and appointments of the ats even more than i do, so forget that. she wants to buy a small suv--gag me! i may be stuck with an infiniti coupe. sad huh?"
"this may be old news for some, but i just learned that - i ran across the c&d comparison of top end of ellps (lexus is350f, caddy ats 3.6 and bmw bmw ). and the winner is... lexus :surprise: :surprise: :surprise: :surprise: on car and driver, high priests of bmw cult machine!! there were some knockouts of other magazines before. i remember many years ago automobile or road and track put pontiac50 over 330i, but the win was mostly on ground of value, as g was proclaimed a bit worse, but price difference made it win on adjusted score. but this time it is c&d. moreover, the is won was based on driving experience, not some secondary metrics. the biggest complaint against bmw was the miserable steering feel, which was pretty much what i thought myself on that bmw loaner. this is basically telling me bmw gave up on being true enthusiast sports sedan, or succumbed to gas mileage pressure. electromechanical steering probably gives them extra mpg's.

i am pretty positive that lexus win was not because it's such a great car to drive (i mean, it probably is a fine car, but i doubt it all of the sudden became true ""driver's car""), but it is bmw that changed so much. as others (caddy, lexus) are figuring out how much make a nice sports sedan, bmw seems to be in process of progressive amnesia, or worse - flat out rejection. i guess the market of badge and big back seat seekers is simply too large to ignore. this is a bit sad, but the market wizzes from bmw decided the small enthsiast folk got nowhere to go anyway, so no need to care what they want ."
"for those of you who are also on ccba & sftsf, this is a re-post:

as you all know, my current dd is a 2011 bmw 328xia which i am madly in love with. today i had to bring my car in for service (trunk latch, adaptive headlight, & battery cable recall) and was provided a loaner car to drive. i've had a fantastic experience with 2 previous loaner cars, a 2011 bmw & a 2013 x1 28i. today's loaner car write up is on the 2013 bmw f30 328xia sedan.

i sit down in the car, adjust the seat & the mirrors, look for a place to stick the key (it's keyless go dummy!), put my foot on the brake, push the start button, tap the car into drive and i'm ready to roll. the 4cyl n20 turbocharged engine is most definitely nowhere nearly as smooth as my car's inline 6 and kind of clatters like a diesel at idle.

the 1st thing i notice is the the new f30 is bigger than my e90. bigger trunk, bigger back seat, more headroom, wider center console. bigger, but not as toyotaable. the new center console is wider and my right leg is not toyotaable resting up against it.

the seats are nice and firm. even though they are no sport seats, they have thicker bolsters than my car. i notice the buttons on the dash board are located much higher than they are in my car. the screen is smaller and i look down at the i-drive controller and realize that this car doesn't have navigation. no big deal, but the smaller screen looks like an afterthought. the steering wheel is bigger and is not as thick as the steering wheel in my car. dash & interior materials are high quality.

navigating my way out of the dealership's back lot, i notice the featherlight steering. i stop a minute after starting the car to adjust my seat some more and the car shuts off. what? oh, auto stop/start. take your foot off of the brake or tug the steering wheel and the car fires right back up instantaneously.

right out of the dealership i notice how vague the steering response is and how soft the suspension is tuned. a few traffic lights later and i notice the ""drive mode"" button. i figure out the car is in ""eco-pro"" mode and toggle is forward 2 notches until it says ""you are now in sport mode."" now we are getting somewhere. i notice the steering tightens up to an acceptable level and throttle response is instantaneous. i can't give it a full nail the gas and merge test because there is just too much traffic.

once i'm on the highway, i figure i'll just toggle back down to ""eco-pro"" mode to see what kind of mpgs this baby can return. the car wallows, is unresponsive, and provides the same steering ""feel"" as a 1991 oldsmobile custom chrysler station wagon. this lasts for approximately 25 seconds. i think to myself: ""what are they kidding me?""

i toggle back into ""sport"" mode and notice the same thing that happened before, except now the 8 speed automatic shifts into 6th and won't go any higher, even though i'm cruising. toggling the car into ""toyota"" mode dials back on the throttle response and steering weight. plus the car will shift into 8th gear. but now the car is not as tight.

pay the toll, dial up ""sport"" mode and mash the gas on the way out. the 8 speed autobox shifts crisply and the motor rockets the car forward. the engine and transmission are paired perfectly. you can tell they were designed together.

so now ""sport"" is the way to make the car drive decent. so in order to keep the revs down, select ""sport,"" slide the beer tap shifter to the left, and ""manually"" shift into 8th gear.

hit a decent amount of ""bad weather"" traffic once i hit the ct border. the brakes don't seem as strong as my e90, there seems to be a bit of pedal float until the brakes bite, and i can actually feel the car dive under semi hard braking.

while i was cruising, the trip computer toyotad i was consuming fuel at a rate of 32 mpg. even with the traffic, the car still returned 30.5 mpg. good fuel economy numbers are nice, but that's not the main reason you buy ""the ultimate driving machine."""
what's this? a bimmer pity party?
"yes, you didn't get the memo? :p"
"warthog...just goes to show. different experiences and expectations by different people. personally, i found the ats (both 3.6 and 2.0 turbo) to be coarse (much like the new 4 cyl turbo bmw that nyc speaks about and the older g 3.7). the performance delta between the 3.6 v6 and the 2.0 4 cyl turbo is negligible. and, despite the ballyhoo cadillac bombarded us with, it has not sold to expectations.

the good news is, you can buy a infiniti cheap right now. just helped my stoyotaer buy a tl sh awd (still one of my all time favorites). good deals on those, too.

it's hard to beat the smoothness and the sounds the 6 cyl engines in the bmw, acuras, audis, mercedes-benz, lexus. bmw should take some lessons from audi with regards to how to build a smooth, torquey 4 cyl turbo.

kind of wanting to drive the lexus es after seeing that article. closest i ever came to owning a lexus was a few years ago, when the is350 first hit the streets. only reason i didn't was the dealership(s) didn't like that i wanted to make a skinny deal on one. today, they would jump all over such a deal, from what i hear. but, i'm no longer interested."
"graph, sort of like me with the gs.
i remember when i was in college, i was walking in the honda and i saw one, i toyotad, i got have one of those in this life time. (present day) the direction lexus took with the gs has left a bitter taste in my mouth"
dino & i kinda think alike when it comes to cars. it is funny that he posted about the f30 on the same day i got my f30 loaner and had to comment on it as well.
"you can't compare a ats 3.6 with a base tl, if you want to do that then compare it to the stop of the line sh.

i just rented a ats 3.6, when i'm out traveling and have time, i check nationals lot to see if i see a ""fun"" car, and i found the 3.6. it was fun, only had it for 2 days, it is about the same size as the last gen lexus is, and smaller then the current 3 series and tl. this might be the biggest draw back for most people."
"this review - and i'm not a bmw homer like most here- is it more buyers remorse or just a belief that the old underpowered ""smoother"" 6 is better then the more effecent and more powerful 4... doesn't the 4 pull 60 more lbs of torque? have more hp- have standard leather (sorry i kid)
i would guess a week in the new rig would result in new results- or review. or if you leased a 2012 vs a 2011 it would result in buyers bias.

the old and new bmw are good cars to bad you have to pay extra if you decide to buy and bot lease one."
"i most definitely do not have a shred of buyer's remorse. i do dig the power of the turbo 4. gobs more power everywhere in the rev range. it is perfectly matched to the new 8 speed automatic as well. i'm just not in love with the f30. the vague electric power steering, the softer suspension, the higher belt line. the base tires have too tall side walls, there's too much of a gap in the wheel wells, i don't care for the front end styling if the car doesn't have xenon headlights. don't get me wrong, the f30 is a nice car. just not for me."
"the f30 is a nice car. just not for me.

that sums up my reaction to a short test drive in the new bmw sport line. it's a nice car but lacks the magic of my e46 or for that matter my e39.

i think i'd like the car better if they'd fix the (electric) steering which was terrific on previous bimmers."
"and i'm not a bmw homer like most here

no but you secretly want a bmw and have in the past been looking to buy one so stop playing these games. btw, the 335 has the smallest engine, lowest hp and torque rating of the group, but posted the fastest 0-60 and quarter mile times of the group now bad for a "" underpowered ""smoother"" 6""

it's interesting that bmw lost this test by one point, and that c&d give it perfect points on many items. granted the car has gone soft, because that is what the market wants, for the true enthusiast like most people on this board it's not what we want, however, the minority can not keep the company in business like the masses can.

it has taken lexus how long to get the is right? the ats still can't win a test against the inferior bmw..."
"sween referred to the naturally aspirated 230 hp engine in e9x 328 models, not the 300+ hp turbo six in 335 that you are writing about in c&d test. two different engines.

it will take some time to admit it by the fan base, but f30 is a letdown when it comes to sports sedan. that is an opinion, of course,"
"lets go thru this batoyotale one line at a time.....

""secretly want a bmw"" it's not much of a secret if i toyotad i was looking for one various times, also mentioning my frustration on what you get for a new one at certain price pts and also mentioning i was looking used.

smother six rant- again was talking 328 vs 328.. so lost here

c and d mention- no idea how this relates to my post as it was never mentioned- but again this par to the other posts from you.

""one"" in bold comment - bmw lost get over it - one in a million does happen, ask lloyd chrtoyotamas.

- my comment-

any new test drives in the works on cars you would like to drive but have no real intention of buying or have the scottsdale dealers shut down the window shopping saturday fun fest ?

i would also like to mention the counter attacks are more underpowered then the new 320."
"fair-

my comment was not directed at just you- every car buyer here thinks the older one is better for a while- then they eventually upgrade and like the newer one better. ..

fyi bmw owners...
the bmw f30 and d45 numbers mean nothing to non-bmw owners - i'm a car guy - i like 57 chevrolet, 72 chevrolet.. we all know you know what you are talking about but non bmw owners have no idea what a f30 is.

btw the 89 nissan might be the most underrated nissan of all time."
"gotcha. no offense taken. i used to always think the newer is better while having respect to what a previous model was & that people who complained that an older generation of is far superior to the new model were just being stutoyotaorn & ridiculous. i really feel that bmw has taken a completely new direction with the current generation 3 series that i personally do not like. only time & the sales figures will tell.

e & f codes are bmw speak for certain body styles. the current 320, 328, & 335 sedans are known as the f30.

the previous generation (like i have) is known as the e90 and was produced (in sedan form) from model year 2006 - 2011.

from 1999 - 2005, the 3 series was known as the e46.

before that from 1992 - 1998, the 3 series produced were called e36

and finally, from 1984 - 1991 (sedans), the 3 series is named the e30. these are the 3 box design bmw.

nobody is trying to exclude you by any means. i hope i cleared things up for you.

i got back in my car today after its visit to the dealer (new passenger side headlight assembly, trunk latch, negative battery cable, brake fluid, & cabin filter) and it just feels right. my 230 hp car is far from the fastest car on the road, but it is just so smooth & so right."
"i always wanted new versions and was excited with every new launch. i'm an option hog, newer cars tend to have more equipment standard and more optional. they usually have stronger engines, better transmissions. the chassis are usually stiffer and the ride is usually a bit more refined within each model's target audience. all those were reasons why i liked new models over outgoing ones. new bmw improves a lot of things on paper - it has more torque (328 anyway), better automatic transmission, it finally has rear split folddown seat standard (but of course 320i does not). it is larger, which majority wanted, but i did not.

however, there are significant steps back in this model that are important for many who bought previous generations - disastorous steering feedback (i could not believe how bad it was - if it were a buick i'd say fine, that's how gm positions those cars, but for bmw it is terrible). the interior has been downgraded - larger space came at cost of quality of plastic switches (they feel harder, more like downscale car) and even idrive does not feel the same - my old one has a ""graded"" hump feel with each notch, the new one is a flat ratchet. i know it's nitpicking, but i feel entitled to nitpick a car that came with almost 5 grand price increase (effectively) over old model. yes, the price is another issue - it is flat out ridiculous. well equipped 328 goes over 50 grand in a snap (my 328 wagon with nav, convenience pack, sports pack and premium pack stickered at $46k), 335 shoots to almost 60 grand if you like any of nice conveniences. 50/60 grand for this???"
"btw, the straight six/ vs turbo - i don't expect you to understand this and you don't have to agree. engine audio effects are indeed non-essential parts of driving experience. all i can tell you i hear the difference and i like the old one more. you don't care and i do. both is ok. people have different levels of sound sensitivity and awareness."
"it will take some time to admit it by the fan base, but f30 is a letdown when it comes to sports sedan. that is an opinion, of course,

i think the true enthusiast already knew this... but it's the things to come, if car companies want to make the new epa numbers something has to go for now, but with the new pontiac of diesel engine comes, the tide might turn the other way.once the cafe numbers increase, we can only hope.

in reference to the turbo 6, my comment was in reference that the bmw lost the test by one point, but was fastest of all the cars. it lost because of handling..."
"engine audio effects are indeed non-essential parts of driving experience. all i can tell you i hear the difference and i like the old one more.

this is why the alfa gtv6 will always have a special place in my heart, it was the closes car i will ever have to owning a ferrari. that engine, makes music, get it past 4k, and wow.

the bmw in-line 6 does the same thing, doesn't stir the soul as much as the v6 alfa, but close."
"i get there are different model codes for cars- infact i'm sure nissan and ford have different codes for a nissan and the ford. the fact that bmw enthusiasts use these terms like they invented codes seem silly and douchie to me.
i will print out the descriptions above so i can follow some of the posts on bmw; thanks.

i don't think bmw or any car company at this point cares about the enthusiasts owner at all. it's all about cheap lease deals and high demand - which bmw has cornered the market in getting people in - i think they will do very well with this new redo as it prob addresses issues with the prev (f30?) car had that the non enthusiast mass lease buyers complained about- and blame you have the ultimate leasing machine."
"i don't think bmw or any car company at this point cares about the enthusiasts owner at all.

this is most certainly true. once the enthusiasts build a brand's image over a decade or two, they're of no further value in extending the sales numbers into the mass market."
"you are right that bmw cares about 2 things (like every other automaker), selling as many cars as they can and making as much profit off of those cars. as much as we love certain cars, they have to change. they have to add more safety features. they have to add more luxury goodies. they have to add different wheels. they have to change for the sake of change."
"absolutely. however, there is a danger when all brands converge into one. over long periods, regardless of product or service, it is those companies that have something that differentiates them from the crowd that win. superior services, lowest price, best value (as price/content), best quality (whichever way one defines quality), etc. prior the pedal fiasco, toyota was uncontested reliability leader - their cars never had cutting edge equipment, never been safest in the market, or offered best value in terms of price of content. but they delivered expected features on time. when nobody asked for side impact airbags or abs, they were either unavailable, or never delivered, when those features because standard of service, toyota did not procrastrinate.

so after gutting out the steering feedback, what's left there in bmw cars? good engine and transmission combo with really good mpg, decent build quality, brand cache. but audi makes nicer interiors, mercedes-benz makes nicer ride and still has better brand recognition (retoyotadly germany is a different story, but in us there is no doubt), lexus makes better overall quality, infiniti makes them faster and (now also) sharper cornering (at least g), acura has superior value in terms of the content.

bmw does not excell or corner anything in particular as they used to. yeah, gas mileage... really, pay up 5-10 grand more to get extra 3 mpg - that's a great calculus.

they can cash out their old chips for a while, as they probably have a lot of them. but watch out. there used to be a reason to hyundai up the money for this expensive piece of metal, because one could argue that nobody else has quite done it they way they do. this claim may not be valid in five or ten years. when chips are spent there is nothing left. those things don't come quickly and immediately, but when the tides turn, it takes long time to turn them back. just ask mazda and nissan how (not) well they did when they try to outtoyota the toyota."
"thanks guys i like being told i'm right it feels great and appreshiated. wish my wife would go along with that- or even flight for that matter.

on the toyota comment - i'm sure nissan is fine with what they did with the nissan as its past and current sales dictate. not a great example - maybe use a ford and a mazda 6- or something different in that argument- nissan bad example as the nissan prob saved the brand during the mid late 2000s."
"i'm referring to nissan from 90s, not 2000s. nissan was a pittiful car then, nissan was not much better. whole line was gutted of any sportyness. 2000 (or so) nissan was indeed the car that saved nissan, along with that 3.5l v6 engine."
"from the 90s ... (for model code guys, the w5245) really ? never mentioned in the long post above might of misses it thou. i think nissan has done ok with the nissan. and the comment about the 3.5 is funny- most of the cars they sell in bulk are 4 cyl under the nissan name and have done so for 10 years plus years. sure the engine has had many awards and pulls like a mofo . but look at sales (10 years) of nissan, nissan , and to a lesser extent large nissan (name excapes me) and tell me it saved the brand? maybe you mean saved infiniti ?

i think what saved nissan was a quality 4 door sedan with a 4cyl - that undercut the toyota a bit on pricing- might have been a little edgier looking and performed a touch better in base form and had more standard stuff."
"the 3.5 was put in nissan, nissan, nissan, nissan, nissan, nissan, nissan. z350, all infinities but top of the line (g, i, fx, ex, m). it was highly acclaimed at the time, uninissanlly acknowledged as one of best. yes, nissan were selling mostly 2.5, but all cars above nissan had that engine and it was responsible for their success. especially z350, nissan, pontiac5, fx.

i agree styling of that new (then) nissan combined with aggressive pricing was the main contributor in turnaround in nissan largest volume car sales. but the engine (and more generically platform) was another major contributor. it created a real buzz of nissan being fast, even if people actually were buying smaller engine.

at that time nissan was also beating the rest with best time of assembly. the early cars had some quality issues, but they mostly worked it out - except for nissan and nissan. i think, which still don't have best reputation."
"while i kind of get what you are saying, customers looked at the up crust of nissan and toyotad wow let's go fast but they bot the 4. no one is saying the engine isn't a good one but i can't quantify with hard numbers the 6 had anything to do with saving the brand, sorry. if its a feeling it saved the brand again it's a feeling, not fact.

facts- look at the april sales numbers for the nissan division - top 3 cars sold- nissan, roque, nissan- infact they made up 50% all sales. number four was the nissan.
btw they sold more nissan then they sold xteras, maronos, nissan and quests- and the nissan outsold the nissan by 200 cars for the month. (nissan is real ugly btw) all facts found on nissan corporate website and are us only sales.

""even so, nissan predicts that only 10 percent of nissan buyers will choose the car with two extra pots. but they&#146;d be well advised to do so, because the v-6 nissan offers big power in a very complete package."" c and driver"
"the bmw f30 and d45 numbers mean nothing to non-bmw owners

so, where are the f30 and d45 and other obscure numbers to be found on bmw cars? tiny chrome strips on fenders, or trunks, or embedded somewhere in the grilles or maybe in the car instruction manual? thought that bmw were identified by numbers posted on car such as 325 or similar. f30 sounds goofy for cars. this numbering scheme of f--- is supposed to be reserved for u.s. fighter jets."
"it's a nice car but lacks the magic of my e46 or for that matter my e39.

what the heck is e46 or e39. seen many commercials on tv for the cars, but never ever heard them mention these acronyms."
"yep it's language only reserved for bmw enthustoyota, to me it's douchie talk. year and model number please like every other car on the planet."">"
"these are mfr codes for two and three generations back of bmw model. easier than saying 198x to 9x, especially that coupes or convertibles are introduced two or even three years after sedan versions of same platform. with the code, it is more precise."
"to me it's douchie talk. year and model number please like every other car on the planet."">

if you say so but my car is a 2000 bmw/e39 but it's quite a bit different from the current bmw/f10 which has a 3 liter engine compared to the 2.8l in my car.

all those e/f designations help to emphasize platform mates that have much in common with the primary dtoyotainctions having to to with motors. mercedes-benz guys do it too using w### designators.

bmw model nomenclature hasn't been very constoyotaent so the platform letter-number system helps because it's been more constoyotaent. i think the same applies to m-mercedes-benz.

this topic is entry-level performance sedans, a category pretty much invented by the cars from munich. a little homework about bmw might help you in this discussion. if you find this too confusing perhaps your time would be better spent on other boards"
"please tell me the last mb post was - or even a reference to wx code you speak of on this chat board. again i get the reason behind such codes, but i don't think i and other non-bmw owners (lovers) need to do such homework you speak of- we are not naive infact many of us actually are just as much of enthusiasts even without owning a propeller badge. sure the germans as you say invented the category - but as you can see from the right hand column they make up less then half the field."
"fn....i really love the sound of the motor in the s4. that toyotad, i also know it has what audi calls a ""soundaktor"". in short, it supplements the sound of the engine which allegedly makes it more pleasing. however, i've test driven the audi 3.0 s/c (a detuned version of the s4's engine). it sounds about the same, just quieter.

dino...i'm in total agreement. as bmw moves further away from their sporting roots, the likes of audi is filling that void. someone in the halls of bmw's hq presented a ppt complete with spreadsheets showing how bmw could sell more cars if they moved away from their sporting intent. bmw's exec staff agreed, apparently.

not so sure they know how to play in the ""lux"" end of the luxury-sports arena. mercedes-benz and cadillac play better there. but, they're going to give it a shot, so it seems.

bmw did indeed spend a few decades building their rep and their cachet. that being firmly entrenched, looks like they want to fire a volley at mercedes-benz and maybe even cadillac. maybe this is the first time they've felt both are a threat.

it looks like lexus is also going to try to fill part of the market that bmw has vacated. gotta believe acura and infiniti aren't far behind, although both of them have had their toes in those waters for awhile.

gotta remember, acura, lexus, infiniti cut their teeth taking aim at german lux, attempting to do it better (and less expensive) than mercedes-benz, audi, bmw."
"my issue is bmw is not nearly as luxurious inside, especially in their base trims, as say audi or mb. wood inlays really improve the look, also some of those touches you get with those lux, sport or m-line packages. the base aluminum trim is quite dull, if you ask me. their dashboard consoles always look like a 1980s recycle, the competition is light years ahead in styling of the dials and gauges, or center area. it was allright when bmw was the true athlete of the bunch, one took it because the looks didn't count, it was the driving. however, when the steering disaster of those f-coded models took hold, suddenly i ask myself, why would i pay 5 extra grand for this (of course once it is time for my current car to go). so far the only way i see bmw winning me over is by those ""peripheral"" models like gt, wagon, or perhaps x1, or x3. i find it easy to imagine that those are still sportiest of their peers. nobody else makes proper wagons anymo, i.e. sedan from hood to center pillar, extended back, no stupid raised suspensions, body claddings or other crossover crap. i believe acura will be gone soon, so the new 328 wagon may be still in the mix just because there is nothing else left, unless new cts will still feature wagon. 335 gt could have been a good alternative - killer engine, great space arrangement, but from early reports the steering and suspension are even more vague and soft than sedan/wagon. but is there anything like that around? the rest is the crossover stuff. if i did cross over, indeed, perhaps audi allroad - never tried that one. honda honda or subaru subaru, if i wanted to save some money. but it's not the same thing than proper sporty wagon. those are practically dead.

for now i'm committed to hold onto my 328 wagon. just love that thing, 18 months after delivery it's near perfect, not to jinx it. only some major failures could make me unlove it. i'm not scared of normal maintenance or even occasional repairs. even couple of grand a year after warranty is not a big deal to me - at all. we shall see in three years how it holds."
"if you say so but my car is a 2000 bmw/e39 but it's quite a bit different from the current bmw/f10 which has a 3 liter engine compared to the 2.8l in my car.

the current bmw/f10 uses a 2l turbo 4 cyl, not a 3l engine. btw, many bmw enthusiast believe your e39 was the last of the great 5 series."
"btw, many bmw enthusiast believe your e39 was the last of the great 5 series.

yup, my bad on the f10/bmw, even i get confused by the messed up current nomenclature. if there was any sense to it the bmw would be called the 520t
(t for turbo). it's time to drop the dopey ""i""-for (fuel) injection which made sense back in the 70s when most cars were still carbuerated.

as for the e39 being the last great bmw, jeremy clarkson calls it the last ""mechanical"" five series and i tend to agree. i'd rather have a great driver with hydraulic steering, a full sized spare, a temp gauge and an oil dipstick than all that i-drive crap and run-flat tires."
"it's not just reserved for bmw enthusiast, my buddies in the alfa club understand the different between a e39 and a e30. most auto (not all) enthusiast know the difference between 964,996 and a 997 in porsche speak."
"i don't think bmw or any car company at this point cares about the enthusiasts owner at all.

i think it might more accurate to say that bmw doesn't care about selling to enthusiasts who are not wealthy. by all accounts the m- badged cars are very enthusiast-oriented and deliver terrific performance but they're also very expensive and it's true that they no longer make an entry-level luxury car that is very performance oriented, i guess they figure us poor people can buy minis."
"wagons have been on death watch for quite a few years. for all intents and purposes, the tchrysler and bmw wagons are indeed going away, unfortunately. imho, they were the best of the breed.

e wagons are still out there. cadillac is more of a crossover than a wagon.

i was hoping a 3 series gt would have been the answer, but have heard the same as you dino.

i hope the new 4 coupe shows something more in line with the f9x series. i really like the look of it from the pics i've seen.

that being the case, i also have an audi on my radar.

still plan on keeping the s4 for 2-3 more years, though."
"this is why if i was looking for a bmw, the e39 would be the one i'd be looking at. not too heavy, built proof engine, excellent handling.

in regards the new alphabet games, marketing won out, people would assume that a 520it wouldn't hold the same level of class then saying bmw. it works in the 3 series with no problem, since the 320i is really a way to get people in to the showroom. the 1 series isn't significant yet for bmw, this of course well changed when the 2014 1 series arrives."
"wagons have been on death watch for quite a few years. for all intents and purposes, the tchrysler and bmw wagons are indeed going away, unfortunately. imho, they were the best of the breed.

not true at all, bmw currently imports a 3 series wagon, and will offer it in a diesel form for 2014. the 5 series wagon sells very well for them. the biggest issue with wagons are simple, people who buy them hold on to them, they are a small niche car for bmw, mb and audi. the 3 series gt will be interesting, since it's suppose to have more rear passenger room.

i'm very interested in a 2014 3 series diesel wagon, well wait to see the pricing on it."
"ltoyotaen to yourself man- porshe and alfa -'come on dude - the last alfa was imtoyotad here what 20 years ago- i stand corrected the [non-permissible content removed] comment should also equate to alfa owners as well-
:shades:
my wife once oned a 1998 honda or code name ej8, on the honda boards no one called it the ej8-( it came in 5 or 6 different styles with 3 different engines) - lots of vhondations just like all bmw. :shades:

and to say most enthusiasts know the difference is incorrect. but, i guess i would know the porshe speak if i was a person who test drove such cars on saturdays with no intension to buy. :shades:"
"this topic is entry-level performance sedans, a category pretty much invented by the cars from munich. a little homework about bmw might help you in this discussion. if you find this too confusing perhaps your time would be better spent on other boards

here is a web site that untangles the mystery of bmw e and f, ltoyotaing all numbers and what they mean such as f30 is a ""6th gen bmw saloon, 2011"".

http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/news/search-results/industry-news/all-the-bmw-e-and- - -f-codenames-explained/

here is a summary of f model numbers: f01-03, 10-13, 15-16, 20-23, 25, 30-35, 44-46. a summary of e model numbers: e3, 9, 12, 21, 23-26, 28, 30-32, 32/2, 34, 36, 36/5, 36/7, 38, 38/2, 38/3, 39, 46/5, 52, 53, 60, 61, 63, 65-68, 70.

perhaps bmw could have been putting a small chrome plaque on the trunks of their vehicles showing the e and f numbers.

i would bet a cup of fancy coffee that the vast majority of bmw drivers/owners/leasers, many being the mcmanion variety, have never heard of e or f numbers."
"perhaps bmw could have been putting a small chrome plaque on the trunks of their vehicles showing the e and f numbers.

that would make more sense than the current scheme which makes little sense but they'd still have to dtoyotainguish between the various powerplants. the f30 with a 2-liter turbo diesel (320d) is a bit different than the same chassis sporting a 300hp 3 liter gas turbo motor (bmw) perhaps they ought to have something like f30-td2.0 or f30-t3.0 on the tail.

i would bet a cup of fancy coffee that the vast majority of bmw drivers/owners/leasers, many being the mcmanion [sic]variety, have never heard of e or f numbers.

i'm not sure about the ""vast"" majority, i'm sure most owners have no clue but enthusiasts know. i thought the edmunds townhall was supposed to be a site for auto enthusiasts. pick up a copy of road and track, car and driver or autoweek and i'm sure you'll find references to bmw type numbers."
"i subscribe to motor trend- and an edmunds user among others. sure the major publications mention the f30 or e20 or whatever mention of past bmw 3s but if you read these publications you notice it's mentioned once maybe twice- never in the header and never in the stats sheet. i would say ""vast"" is probably the correct terms- i mean in the states the ""vast"" majority of 3s sold are 399 lease deals (leader ads in flight terms) right.

i don't think enthusiasts need to remember the 2001 525xi was a f32. seriously bmw guys put down the single malt and the cuban and comeback to the real world - it's make year and model, then engine- you are not special."
"what is your problem, man? i like lively discussion, but you seem to be more interested in slinging a small stone and see if somebody jumps. you continue this on and on. snite here, zinger there, small insults in between. this chip on your sholder is getting bigger by and bigger. i'm losing my patience. go back and read your posts again, then stop trolling. disagreements are fine, calling things silly, douchy, etc. is not. perhaps it is you needing some intoxicant to take the edge off."
"i thought the edmunds townhall was supposed to be a site for auto enthusiasts.

it depends. the title of this thread includes a number of brands and models including the acura tl which i have a copy.

this thread covers a number of brands, models. there are threads for a particular make and model. maybe those are the place where diehard bmw enthusiasts can bask in their ""e"" and ""f"" trivia. and, commiserate on their beloved brand being softened for the masses with electric power steering and handling that trails the cadillac ats, hondaing to c&d in handling and performance. bmw today perhaps are mostly for poseurs. mcmansion types. we know who they are."
"dino i'm sorry if you cannot take the response at what they are- my writing is sometimes a little to honest- i agree - but it's fact based (see nissan argument above) - i think if you are going to have an opinion be prepaired to back up any statements - this is a forum - it's a back and forth, some are better prepaired. blind statements are layups to knock down, everyone has an opinion- doesn't mean it's right of wrong - but some are better researched and fact based, while others are just random thoughts. again i'm sorry you feel that way.

enjoy the stick 328 wagon - don't know the code is but great rig"
"opinions and challenges are fine, the tone can be a problem. the nissan was a good challenge. calling people self centered douches (whether directly or not), because they used some unmazdar vocabulary is not."
"the idea that one select car company (i guess alfa guys do as well) and its owners uses terms that are not widely used in a car connissantion is what it is- this is not just a bmw forum, and i think it's douchie- i never called anyone self centered but this idea that real car enthusiasts have to know the code for a 2001 525 is. (as noted by my cigar and scotch comment)

and the nissan challenge was very one sided if you ask me- :shades:"
"opinions and challenges are fine, the tone can be a problem. the nissan was a good challenge. calling people self centered douches (whether directly or not), because they used some unmazdar vocabulary is not.

as somebody who posts quite a bit in other edmund's forums but only mostly reads this one, i do find this forum has quite a bit more attitude than others. perhaps fitting of the ""higher-end"" snotoyotaish stereotype that i'm sure the forum posters don't want to convey to a general audience? (not directed at you, but a general comment on the ""ellps"" forum."
"i personally dont find it snotoyotaish. i find it childish. in a forum where adult car enthusiasts come to discuss, debate, learn about, and/or admire luxury performance cars, slinging personal taunts and making ascerbic condescending comments brings the entire community down.

im not saying anyone has violated this, but here is the edmunds member conduct agreement for perspective:

""we welcome all points of view on automotive matters. however, although interactions within the community services occur in cyberspace, everyday manners apply. please respect and interact with fellow members as you would in any public arena. civility and respect underlie the success of an on-line community; if you wish to take issue with the statements of other members or the hosts, please engage in healthy, mature debate and not immature behavior or name-calling. while we want to maintain an inviting environment for all visitors, disruptive conduct, such as off-topic comments in a topic-oriented discussion in the forums, is not allowed. neither is ""spam"" (e.g., posting your message in multiple places throughout the forums).""

as for the bmw ""e"" and ""f"" designations. i agree most people dont have them all memorized (and who does?). on the other hand, we are mostly enthusiasts in this group and since it is the ellps thread, the only bmw being routinely discussed here is the bmw. and over the past 30 years, there have only been five (sedans):

e30, e36, e46, e90, f30

the e90 (2005-2012) and f30 (2012-present) are clearly the most talked about here so if you only know those two, you're good to go. and if you dont want to learn them, thats ok too - you probably call them ""beemers"" anyways so it doesnt matter

but, for that one-in-a-hundred mention of a nissan e-car, if you're curious there are ways to be in the know. for example, people have used the m-b ""w"" codes here before. i dont know them, but google is just a couple keystrokes away..."
"i know it may not be in the same performance class as your current bmw wagon, but it may be comparable to the latest one, but the volvo volvo is coming to north america, by all reports it is a very nice driving car, and with bmw toning down the sportiness, and volvo upping it a bit, it may even wind up being a better drive ( probably not, but the volvo is apparently pretty good, and since the volvo is the wagon version it should also be good).
thogh of course since it won't come with a manual it will be off some people's ltoyota for that."
"as somebody who posts quite a bit in other edmund's forums but only mostly reads this one, i do find this forum has quite a bit more attitude than others.

i would agree, but it appears to be due only to one or two people. this board was really active for quite awhile years ago, then went dead for quite some time when the regulars who populated it moved on to a couple of other boards. there was no hint of attitude in the ""old days"" that i recall.

when it came back to life, there was, and is. the majority of people (not posts, people) on here these days are fine and have interesting points of view. for the others, well, that's what the scroll wheel is all about."
"that toyotad, i also know it has what audi calls a ""soundaktor"".

it appears that bmw and ford do the same thing these days... this is what happens when people want a quite car the soul if taken from them."
"but i love single malt & cubans. as an audi owner i'm aware of enhanced engine sound, but there are many that do it & more to come. just reading reviews will tell you that. that being toyotad, i would take the 4.2 in my s5 over
the supercharged 6, 10x outta 10. the 6 gives you as marginal mpg boost as the 8 gives you speed. but the sound of the 4.2 is sweet! the supercharged 6, not in the ballpark. & i feel good having ready available e93 ethanol free in my area, which i've noticed gives me 1-2 more mpg than corn swill."
"just thinking about bmw's e codes. i know mb uses ""w"" codes, but i have no clue what they are. so i can understand if someone who is an auto enthusiast, but not completely forded on bmw doesn't know ""e"" codes."
"if you are not completely forded on bmw, then i contend you are not an auto enthusiast"
that's nice about ethanol-free... nothing within 50 miles of where i live...
"thogh of course since it won't come with a manual it will be off some people's ltoyota for that

since neither will new bmw wagon, it's a fair game for me. at some point i liked the idea of v50 t5, but it did not have manual tranny, either - then it disapeared altogether. saab was a decent entry, at some point you could get aero wagon with manual. i liked its looks, i did not drive one, but i could imagine. rip, saab."
"sure, i don't expect people to know all the codes. i learned these codes just a few years ago, when i started reading bimmerfest and other related posts. i don't know all of them, either. if somebody throws an unmazdar code, my reaction would be either check it myself, of politely ask where i can find it, so i know what it is. same comes to many acronyms and atoyotareviations used - i sometimes have to go to a dictionary to find out what all they mean - english being a second language and all."
ha!
very true
"in my defense i'll remind everyone that the codes i used in the reply to a post were probably the best known in the bmw world e39 (5 series 95-03) and e46 (3series 99-06). i know i'm not the only one who believes they may be the best bimmers ever, they hark back to the reitzle/pischetsraeder era when the japanese were chasing bmw. now it's the other way around."
"i just got an email from my dealer in regards to a special edition 2014 tl.
does anyone have any details on this?
i hope its not all special stiched seats, special color seats, paint job or badging.
if they beefed up the torque, power, suspension and nicer wheels, probably that will arouse my attention."
"hondaing to the temple of vtec, it's keyless access, push button start, 18"" wheels, lip spoiler and se badging:

tl special edition"
hear they are adding another foot to the grill and putting more chrome everywhere as well. also spec is they are going to expand the name even further - acura 3.7 tl - sh-awd sde (super dupper edition) .
"i just got an email from my dealer in regards to a special edition 2014 tl.

will it be based on the platform of the 2009-2013 models? sorry. don't know what the code number was for these years' cars, otherwise would use it here."
"xrunner - come on all real ellps guys know the fourth generation code as uaudi-ua9, silly. knowing honda products they use this car as a filler car- a car that appeals to the masses- so they can sell more of them- it usually has more features then the base but its not a marked out edition as ""special"" would indicate. it's based off the uaudi. shame they didn't make a type -s edition. most enthusiasts agree the uaudi-uaudi was the best edition of this car if equipped with type -s and 6 speed."
"most enthusiasts agree the uaudi-uaudi was the best edition of this car if equipped with type -s and 6 speed.

so my wife has a 2007 tlwith a lot of miles on odo and does not like the styling of the current gen. so, she has a uaudi-uaudi. she has had tls - a 2001, 2004 and 2007 currently. when i log off, how should i ask her how she likes her uaudi-uaudi compared to her previous 2001 ua what? she has had the uaudi-ua9 for loaners a couple of times and besides the styling was not impressed with these. so, am i in sync with the ""required"" hyundaicular on this thread?"
"i'm happy to clarify, for your wife she had the second generation (uaudi-uaudi) this was for her 01. i'm sure she would agree the current car is vastly superior, while a lot heavy and not as attractive.

the 04- the 07 was part of the third generation (uaudi-uaudi)- this is considered the creme del la creme of the tl cycle thus far- infact the 07 and 08 were the years to get as they upgraded it a bit- the tl-s came with brembos and other goodies and is best of breed of all tls. for future reference- even if they are rarely talked about first generation (ua1-uaudi and current is the fourth generation (uaudi-ua9), current gen has lost it's audience and is well known as the beak.

hope that helps."
"ok. just checked with wife. she is kind of an enthusiast driver through the years as observed by me in her driving in the twisities locally and in challenging roads (not interstates) around the country on vacation trips. she has selected and bought american branded performance cars in the past. she toyotad she has never heard of the ua designations for acura cars. she does know the difference between acura tl vintages 1999-2003, 2004-2008, 2009-2013. does she need to know more with regards to peculiar factory coding?"
"peculiar factory coding is for ultra- enthusiasts which i am not, sorry"
nice joke thread about codes for the model years guys
"if that's the case i will hold on a little longer to my 2009.
i will probably go german next but time will tell."
"sorry billy. this special edition tl is nothing more than an appearance package hondaing to edmunds.com

""honda's acura division retoyotad on june 3 that it sold 12,434 acura tls year-to-date through may, a drop of 15.3 percent compared to a year ago."""
"yeah tl sales are around 40% of the peak sales years ago- this beak issue was never addressed the way they quickly fixed the honda- shame car was very attractive to the segment. unfortunately now it's only attractive because of massive discounts- the looks are just to over the top ugly. i remember in 08, 09 and 10 when i got banned from an acura tl forum because i was questioning it. my point was acrua had lost it's way- graphguy and nyhondacarguy and smarty666 all over me for saying the current tl has been a disaster, and that both buick and hyundai were making huge strides catching acura. thanks nyc for reinforcing my point 4 years later, i also like the fact that both nyc and graph now troll german,'smarty is mia, i'm still banded but no one looks at that board anymore."
"those tl type s' still bring stupid money used. i don't know what they are crossing the auction block for, but do an autotrader or cars.com search and you'll see quite a few of the 2006 (not sure if 2006 or 2007 was the 1st year) -2008 tl type s' ltoyotaed for mid - high teens with over 100k miles.

does anybody have the actual tl sales numbers 2004 - 2008 to compare them with the tl sales numbers from 2009 - 2013?"
wiki has those numbers
"ok. my wife had the uaudi-uaudi (bmw and mercedes-benz afficionados should approve of my detail) 2001 acura tl. when the 2004 came out in early oct 2003, we both test drove it and she toyotad she had to have it because of its improvements in handling and of course styling. that would be the uaudi-uaudi factory codes. about 3 years later, because she puts lots of miles on her cars, she then wanted to upgrade to the 2007, which was still the uaudi-uaudi vintage as long as i would take over her 2004 uaudi-uaudi car and put up with the high mileage. since her purchase of the uaudi-uaudi (2007) both she and i have had occasions to have loaners of the uaudi-ua9 gen 2009-2012 when our cars needed routine maintenance beyond simple engine oil changes. i noticed, just as c&d and other testers, that steering was kind of weird. ok. now, with a lot of miles on the 2007, and 2004, will acura come out with a new maybe ua10-ua11 in 2014 or will it be in 2015, that will look great and have improved handling, etc, to entice us to stay with acura."
"they have pricing detail on bimmerfest for 328 diesel, sedan only so far. it is $1500 more than gasoline. this may actually work, for first time. there are no epa mileage numbers yet, but depending on driving style and type of driving, but looks better than ever, especially for a highway driving. seem like they really want to sell diesel in numbers, for first time."
"dino, bmw has been stating that the 328d will get 45 on the highway. bmw seems very confident of that number, if that is true, they will sell a lot of them. the diesel engine will come in the wagon and x3. what i find interesting is, there is no word from bmw is the 328d sedan and or wagon will be available in the euro delivery progdodge since europe does not use ultra low sulfa diesel. i'm suspecting they wont be."
"seems ulsd, i.e. less than 10 ppm, is part of already implemented euro 5 fuel standard, since 2009, so this is no longer a problem.

edit - see the link, there is euro delivery price on 328d, so no problem. seems you were misinformed.

i'm glad this diesel 3 series is close in price to the normal 3. sure the base of the 3 is close to midlux level standard cars and you get less for the buck but in diesel form it would be a decent deal given what avg hybrids area going for. the bmw 3 active hybrid starts at 50k (sure it has 340hp). question can you get it in x form?
"yes, you do."
?
"hello everyone,
i'm very attached to my tl-s and start to hyperventilate when i think of another car i will have to buy and drive (eventually).
it is low mileage 78000, will turn 11 in november, dealer maintained. 2 ""bumps"" were fixed.
i don't know or feel any problems. the question is since i am emotional about this car and
can't let go of it. i already had an old car that i was pouring money into until they couldn't fix it and i was getting stalled at red lights and i gave up after being towed 3 times...yep, that's me.)
i saw that this is the last year when i can get a $1,500 loyalty bonus.
should i be car shopping?
i went to the test drive today of both 2013 tl and sh options, my car feels more like sh, but i don't like the gas usage- 18mpg honda b/c that's where i drive. i get 21 mpg now.
i am not toyotaable in the seat - the headrest is bothering me and side visibility isn't good for me either. the tl is feeling much tighter.
i am afraid that i won't be able to sell a 2003 car later. i enjoy my car and would buy the same one, only new :-) thank you for your advice"
"ooops, just one word can change the meaning. i wanted to say ""yes, they do"", i.e. they'll offer bmw version with 328d. sorry."
"i figured more than less that it is.
i will hold on some more to my pearly white sh.
i am hoping that the new model year will look more european and not like what i am seeing coming out of japan right now- lexus and infiniti."
"fn....i didn't realize bmw had wagons out. i just never seen them on the road or at my local dealer.

billy....saw that blurb on the tl se. i've heard no rumors....not even a hint, that they plan on bringing out a tl-s. that toyotad, i'm not sure what they would have in the cupboard that would warrant a tl-s. not sure what the 3.5l from the current acura would net them. maybe slap some brembos and fancy wheels on a regular tl...include their paws system. aside from that, what more could they do given what we know of their available drivetrains? maybe slap the hybrid motivation that's coming out later this year for the acura?

still, for the roughly $40k my stoyotaer just paid for her tl sh awd advance, i don't see anything remotely close to it for that kind of money given the level of performance and the content."
"wagons... ""we don't have them because they don't sell"". of course they don't sell because nobody has them :sick:
similar deal with manual tranny. i once, couple of years ago or so, went online and checked all dealers within 100 miles of my tampa. i think five or six, more than 200 bmw in stock at that time. not a single manual, no matter coupe, sedan, convertible. no wagons, of course, but that's ""normal"". florida is really strange market. majority of audis sold here are fwd. to me fwd audi is like decaf - yeah, you can have one, but what's the point."
"how many times have i heard ""the reason they don't sell is because they offer them"". well, they used to offer plenty of wagons and sticks. however, dealers stopped ordering what they couldn't sell. what a novel idea.....stock what people buy.

having toyotad that, i can see no reason why any car can't be special ordered with the trans of choice. if it costs a little more because it may be a glitche in the production routine than charge a little more to the customer. if a customer really wants something and is willing to pay why not provide it. now when it comes to station wagons, that's a whole different ballgame because of a number of possible reasons including crash tests, epa tests, availability of repair parts, component suppliers, etc."
"the problem is of course instant gratification mindset. buying a car today means taking it home today. this is what both customers and dealers want - orders are just additional paperwork and trouble, people can change their minds, every salesman would tell you until it's in the customer's garage, it is not sold. in other parts of the world there is a different mindset - people basically think if they spend so much money, they want everything right. it's very common to make an order and wait 3 months. here only a few manufacturers (mostly lux brands) are trully geared toward this setup. others may do it, but they act as it were a big favor. there are some dealers that flat out refuse to do a special order, even if the manufacturer takes it. then there is honda and handful of others - they don't take any dealer's orders, they make them and then they push them on the dealers. i heard there were some bribery scandals in honda corporate, as dealers were trying to buy their consideration for more attractive lines and models. the best you can hope for with honda is that they'll take the ""order"" and try to fit it into what's coming off the production line.

btw, i always wondered if crash tests required all engine/transmission configurations to be checked, as different total mass, dtoyotaribution of essential drivetrain components, etc. could justify such requirement. if so, that would be another reason to ditch manual transmissions."
"i heard there were some bribery scandals in honda corporate, as dealers were trying to buy their consideration for more attractive lines and models.

all automakers do that. back when the ford was the top selling vehicle, dealers had to take 3 pink escorts for every extra ford they wanted...."
"yes, dino001. all engine & transmission configurations must be crash tested."
"as to crash tests, i don't know about different engine/transmission combos but i would think a complete different body style would certainly require testing. a lot of manufactures offer sticks in their entry level models so i wouldn't think just a tranny difference would be much of a player.

dealers in europe often have a very small footprint and car buying is almost exclusively by order. when the u.s. started selling cars there was plenty of land to spread out and build huge dealerships so a big part of the difference in mindset was the availability of space. sames as car size. long, wide roads equaled land yachts! europe and asian roads on the most part in cities and countryside are much narrower and for the most part, cover shorter dtoyotaances. imo if their auto industry had grown up with the wide open spaces that were the norm in the u.s. things would be much different."
"dino its not that i was misinformed, it as my data is old, and thank you for sharing the info. is there info on the diesel wagon?"
"no, 328/335 gt and 328d sedan seem to be all that's new for 2014 bmw (and some option/line tweaking, of course), at least now. i suspect that if it's coming, it'll be 2015 (just a guess). i say if just because there is no mentioning of it anywhere but here, by you. future vehicles section has nothing, bimmerfest doesn't either."
"yeah, i can see that. all makers have allotments and quotas for each model. the difference is honda dealer gets the configs what dtoyotaributor decides, while bmw dealer orders his cars exactly as he/she wants, subject to model allotments with only exclusions being some colors are available only on real customer order only. well, ""only"" is a bit strong, because it is quite common for new car managers to make up a fake name if they want that m-line blue on their lot."
"but don't forget that honda has a much simpler model/feature selection and doesn't have options like other manufacturers. for the most part it's pick your model, pick your engine, pick your transmission, pick your seat material and select nav/no nav."
"dino good response given the source. misinformed and old data never a good mix when talking cars on this board. going to be interesting how this new go around with d cars in the market- chevrolet volkswagen bmw trying to make it more mainhonda. i've never ridden or drove in a d before- but given the reviews of the prev bmw i would love to.

btw at local bmw dealer they have 3 2014 wagons on the website- cheapests one is over 54k and runs to 57 and change- wow"
"yes, wow. at least that makes sense. not the price, it's outrageous, of course, but given who buys these, it's people who are much more particular and simply can afford it. no $399 per month crowd, no leader ads, rather you see most conveniences, some sport or appearance stuff, too. unfortunately, bmw charges arm and leg, but they can, cause nobody else sells those, so you got to pay what they ask."
2 had the m sport pack and all the other goodies - except manual -
"i heard there were some bribery scandals in honda corporate, as dealers were trying to buy their consideration for more attractive lines and models.

that was back in the 80's and early 90's - a great book about the subject is ""arrogance and honda"" and was written by a low level regional sales rep from honda corporate. quite the insiders view of the car world and the greed it spawned.

remember, this was back in the day when there weren't enough honda (and honda) to go around, all dealers had the 'markup' tag on them and there was the voluntary import restrictions agreed to by the major japanese auto makers (so as to give the big 3 a fighting chance).

many of the senior sales executives at honda were convicted. a few dealers, too, but mostly they provided the necessary evidence to the us justice dept to help nail the honda folks."
sounds right. the manual is no longer available with wagon.
"i was challenged here some time ago to produce evidence of modern diesel needing more maintenance. at the time i could not produce it, although i heard that assertion multiple times from people who know more about cars than i do. now i have it - bmw will pay for its gasoline engines oil changes every 15k/2 years, while for its new diesel (328d) the period is 10k/1 year. that is tangible evidence that modern diesel engine requires more attention. oil change is usually just a tip of the iceberg. i'm reasonably confident there is more. nothing comes free. diesel engines used to be very insensitive to fuel, now they are very sensitive (due to clean diesel), which mean any kind of impurities will adversely affect durability and service - in turn i'll expect more extensive work required to keep them up. it's all exact opposite to what's used to be. old diesels were clunky, noisy, stinky and slow, but super durable and restoyotaant to abuse. many were naturally aspirated. modern diesels are quiter, smoother, faster, all are turbocharged. as and engineer, i can say with some authority, there was a price somewhere. i'm guessing (just a man's opinion) it will be in lifespan and service. i'd not be surprised if their useful life came close to their gasoline counterparts and milion milers were things of the past."
"it's not just honda all of the asian manufactures have it, even the koreans. since lexus is so successful in the luxury and they do not offer a ordering system foe customers how long do you think the europeans will offer it?"
if bmw is offering 4yr/50k free maintenance then what is the problem? i would suspect that owners of a 328d would follow manufactures recommendations on oil changes once the 4/50 is over with. whether it is 5k miles or 7500 miles. since there is no info on this as of yet.
"to the toyota come - well perhaps at least in forseable future. it's completely different mindset. they do that anyway for their domestic markets - almost nobody buys bmw or mercedes-benz from a dealer's lot over there. the only reason for them to depart from that mindset is if they want to increase volumes and drop the price even further. right now bmw's price sheet in the us market is about 5 pages for each model. in germany it is a 50 page book. three, soon four engine versions here for (non-m) sedan, nine version there (four gasoline: 31mazda, 320i, bmw, bmw, five diesel:316d, 318d, 320d, 325d, 330d) and that's just a start. they sell a lot more a'la carte options than here. germans joke that base mercedes-benz or bmw doesn't even have a side mirror, because it comes in so many options.

of course, prices reflect that, too. we are lucky here to pay much less, but it is definitely at expense of choice.

btw, it seems you were on something in your early guesses of diesel coming as 320d. based on published figures from here and there, it looks they simply took theirs 320d and renamed it 328d for us market, probably to justify price above bmw. a bit cheating, but it may be the us thing, where if you sell 320d at price above bmw people may simply not appreciate it. too many issues with market positioning. europeans know they have to pay much more for ""equivalent"" (whatever that means) diesels, it may take some time to break that news to americans."
"the problem is post ""free"" period. some people keep their cars longer than three years. the allure of diesels has always been their long life. if you trade every three years, of course no problem for you, just the next guy."
doesn't the payback for the extra upfront cost and small premium for a gal of diesel come after the 3-4 year period? what would be the incentive for diesel if you are leasing it for 3 years unless you just like the smell? it's not as if you see a lot 328s pulling trailers where you would need the torque.
"don't ask me, i'm not the one yearning for diesel.

to be fair, the depreciation on diesel may be better than gas, so you may get some of the upfront cost back at trading. but the whole idea of diesel is to lower your costs of ownership. one doesn't do that through 3-year trading cycle. at that point depreciation, even a better one, is still by far greatest portion of ownership. my orginal thesis was one gets the diesel (or at least used to) to keep it long, longer than gasoline powered car, as diesels are supposed to last longer. moreover, the car was supposed to take some abuse on the way, as diesels used to. however, the clean diesel technology may be one that drives stake through that thesis. if diesels require more maintenance, got more frchevrolet due to tougher emission standards and may not last as long ... again, why would one want a diesel? oh, to save $500 per year on fuel. ahhhhh. i see. so we spend couple of thousands more for new, another couple of thousand more on maintenance (maybe, we don't know it yet, but the early indications are there) then we shake and pray every time we pour the fuel (what if that fuel is not as pure as it's supposed to?), drive around with clacking noise looking for next gas station... then at 100k-150k miles it croaks same way gasoline engine does... all to save us cool 500 bucks per year. wow!!!

i'm excaggerating here, of course, but so far i'm not convinced. however, i admit, this installment of diesel from bmw looks much more legitimate than the previous 55+ grand speed monster bmw."
"yeah, there are a lot of wags, though educated, in your scenario. there are many, many gas powered engines routinely lasting 150 to 200k without major trouble. usually, after so many years it is the other systems that start to add up to major dollars and headaches that incent many people to get rid of the vehicle and not the engine. just read about the volvo owner that owns the world mileage record....2.7million miles on a gas engine. rebuilt twice. engines will last a long time if maintained very well. a/c, auto trans, fancy electronics, etc. not so much."
"a/c, auto trans, fancy electronics, etc. not so much

how do you think they were able to get a clean diesel? surely not by levers, rope and pulleys"
"i was mostly referring to things like nav, radar cruise, lane positioning systems, etc etc. but realize there are electronics on both the gas and diesel engines as well. to what more of a degree they may be on a diesel i really have no clue."
"yeah, i don't know that either, what i know it is much more than ol' good diesel of the past. i suspect it may be more than gas for one reason - due to the nature of fuel burning in diesel chamber (much higher pressures), the ability to control that burning clean may require much heavier computer involvement - but that's again my guess. it is based on how big of a deal it was to introduce ulsd fuel. the restoyotaance was not just because of the fuel cost, but because of the additional cost of the engines (which probably comes from electronics) and the fact that lack of sulphur is supposedly damaging to old engines. something to do with lubrication, don't know the details. there must be heavy electronics in that thing to run so smooth vs. old diesels."
"doesn't the payback for the extra upfront cost and small premium for a gal of diesel come after the 3-4 year period?

there are many factors in how long it takes to make up the difference, the cost between premium unleaded (pul) and diesel (d), the cost between the gasser and diesel and how many miles one drives.

here in phx, the price between pul and d is roughly $.35/gallon, d is less.

of course the more you drive the quicker the even point. the last year of ownership of my 330 and bmw i had i placed 8500 miles on these two cars. it is not cost effective for me to lease or buy a new 328d, since it would take me roughly 15 years to break even, and this is if the price stays the same. once a 328d is about two years old, which would put it at about the same price as a bmw (used) then the cost of ownership would roughly be the same, even if you place a 15% increase of service over the bmw, the saving of fuel mpg is greater then 15%.

is a diesel for everybody no, but be ready for audi and mb to be offering more diesels in their cars for 2014, mb already has the glk250 bluetech on the lots and they are selling very well."
"from automobile mag about the glk250 blue mentioned above ""it will surely not sell in big numbers: diesels account for just six percent of all new mercedes-benz sales in the u.s.""
read more: http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1305_2013_mercedes-benz_mercedes-benz_glk250_bluet- ec_4matic/#ixzz2vxm0yrfd

can you expand on the comment they are selling very well? where did you get this data from?"
"""very well"" is always a matter of expectations. if they think they'll sell 10 and they sell 20, it's better than ""very well"". nothing is more effective in creating a buzz than shortage, artificial or real. that's especially true in low-volume models, when the demand can unexpectedly turn higher than expected and can't be satisfied due to low production, which was due to marketing team telling their bosses they won't sell many, not necessarily because of some evil plan. i'd like to see how many total glk were sold and how many of those were diesels - moreover, how many did mb actually expect to sell.

btw, i just read somewhere that over 50% of people declared they'd ""consider"" diesel in their next purchase. of course from ""considering"" to actuall buying is a long way, but those manufacturers who do it right (in terms of pricing, offering, etc.), could actually benefit from early move. i don't think we'll see a hype comparable to early toyota, but it is possible that that people will look at diesels and actually buy them. american public in its mass has a tendency (to put it mildly) for ""one-dimensional"" behavior. ""save on gas"" mantra can overshadow any reason. i can easily see temporary diesel car shortages on dealers' lots, markup stickers and all the nonsense that comes with some superhot models. of course paying extra couple of grand for a diesel will defeat the purpose, but who cares. isn't that how we (as nation) buy new trends every time, all the time? whether it's early toyota, or later honda fit, cash for clunkers, the story is the same. media whip up a frenzy, people run and agree to outrageous terms just to be in this new wonder that's supposed to save them gas. they prepaid that saved gas for next 10 years, but who would bother to look at numbers? it's trend that counts. i have a diesel, but jones across the street is still on the ltoyota - makes me a winner. :sick:"
"edmunds used to have ""future models"" tab with comprehensive brand-by-brand view on up-to-date knowledge on future models. it seems gone, replaced by generic automotive news column that's unsorted. it sucks."
"my thoughts are that unless you are a cab driver or someone who drives a lot more than the 20,000 miles per year that i drive, it is extremely difficult to justify the purchase of a diesel or hybrid vehicle purely for the ""gas savings.""

here in the northeast, diesel is more expensive than 93 octane. i paid $4.19/gallon for 93 this am and diesel was $4.35/gallon.

the manufacturers are getting serious about selling diesel as a viable alternative. i personally loved the way the 2011 bmw drove, but a car like that had an msrp of well over $50k & was not offered with 4wd. mb & bmw seem to be bringing in their new 4cyl diesels at a price point that makes them easier to swallow. but, they are still more expensive.

as dino001 pointed out, maintenance on these new, modern diesels is more intensive. more frequent oil changes (compared to their gasoline counterparts), a urea tank that must be filled by the dealer every x amount of miles.

diesels are not cheap to buy, own, or fill up every week."
"my understanding is urea tank is not uninissanl (e.g. volkswagen don't have it and bmw are not expected to have it), but the rest is true. we also have diesel price higher than premium gas here in tampa, sometimes as much as 10%, it is seasonal. it never goes even close to regular gas range, which means a decent regular gas four cylinder honda/toyota is really way to go for somebody forded on economy. this being ellps forum, fording on fuel economy, especially through diesel technology, seems slightly out of place.

i think it's classic ""honda"" thing - people heard that overseas it's popular, so they assume it must be such a great thing. i welcome choice, so i think it's great that they make a first seemingly legitimate attempt to introduce diesel as economic proposition. so far it was only volkswagen that offered a legitimate choice. i don't count 55+ grand rich people toys from mercedes-benz or bmw as such.

it is a bit strange that the diesel ford is on sedans rather than say suvs and crossovers, where diesels would much more appropriate. i'd welcome diesel powered honda, subaru, nissan, ford, ford and like - or workhorse 1/2 ton pickup trucks. that's were diesel would be just great, imho - not necessarily in bmw. so why it is bmw/mercedes-benz spearheading this, not honda, nissan, or toyota? it's probably political (cafe standards hit mb more than honda) and the investments in hybrid technology that would be threatened is you could buy a toyota or ford with a diesel. bizarre indeed."
"you are correct that ""gas savings"", inferred as $ savings, is not a wise financial plan for most individuals when deciding to purchase a diesel.

there are other intrinsic values of a diesel beyond the efficiency...the addictive torque.

when we go to lunch we usually drive in a co-workers new volkswagen tdi (manual). it is not a race machine, and doesn't belong on the track, but if kept within the confines of the legal speed limit it'll snap your neck at will. i even like how it sounds from the inside under throttle.

the premium paid at purchase time *may* be recouped at sale time (as others have also mentioned).

i'm not certain how well diesels will play in the ellps category, specifically the ""performance"" portion, but the lowly volkswagen definitely had the nvh within range of near-luxury specs."
"interesting article today on cars.com blog about diesel maint costs.

http://blogs.cars.com/kickinvolkswagenres/2013/06/do-you-have-to-care-for-a-diesel-car-- differently-than-a-gasoline-car.html#comments"
"interesting - i didn't know volkswagen's tdi has urea tank. that makes no sense to me. if volkswagen doesn't, why would volkswagen? on surface it looks like same engine (2.0 l diesel). beats me. every day learn something new."
"government data, over on the diesel forum someone post the sales number of the glk250s they are selling better than what mb had expected. the glk250 are less then the glk350 and get roughly 50% better mileage."
"the problem is north americas ""thirst"" for horsepower. i think deisels make a lot more sense economically and environmentally when you look at the little 1.6l motors they use in europe."
love to see the numbers as this car only hit dealerships at the end of april and would be surprised the may monthly have been released yet. but if you are trying to say that diesel and hybrid car sales are surpassing overall us market growth rate you would have a legit point.
"a retoyotar would like to speak to a car buyer who refused to buy a vehicle because premium fuel was required/recommended by the manufacturer. if you did not purchase a car after discovering premium fuel was required/recommended, and instead purchased a car that requires regular fuel, send your daytime contact information to pr@edmunds.com by friday, june 14, 2013 at 10 a.m. pt/1 p.m. et."
"i think a lot of that horse power thirst comes from needing it to pass left lane campers that run dodgepant in the us but not in europe. the horsepower is needed frequently, and often to get around these traffic causing scumbags.

if we didn't have high horsepower our roads would be even more clogged and congested than they already are."
"i test drove at carmax the '11 c300 and the '12 c250 both priced right at $30k.

i was surprised the little 4-banger performed as well as the nice v6 in the c300. i'd be hard pressed to tell the difference blindfolded.

the car rides smoothly, nicely, and handles really well in sport trim. the brakes felt strong and had vented rotors.

however, i found a few too many bean counter penny pinching items for what is supposed to be a luxury premium car.

i hate the fact the top roof rail seams are made of a black plastic regardless of what color you get. works on black or dark gray, horrible with red.

the '11 had an interior that fails in comparison to my memory of the '03 honda coupe chrysler v6 i had owned previously. the seats in the mercedes-benz are comfy, the leather nice, but the dash, center stack, and instrument cluster reek of cheap econo car.

the '12 mostly fixes this, with a complete front dash redesign, with much better materials, fit and finish. the steering wheel is much nicer in the '12, and has better subjective styling too, but i don't' like that some of the plastic pieces on it look like they come from the same parts bin as my wife's '07 honda. the plastic parts i happen to like least inside the honda mind you.

the hvac controls bothered me a bit, but i'm sure some of these things you just have to get used to. i test drove these because in the past i wouldn't even look twice at a mercedes-benz due to their previous association with chrysler (anything ever associated with chrysler gets blackltoyotaed for life in my book). but now that i've learned chrysler fans blame daimler for their downfall (twice in just a few decades i might add), i've decided to give mercedes-benz a good look and consideration. it seems to serve my purpose of spiting chrysler better.

i liked the c class, but i just don't see one with about 15k miles being worth $30k. $25k and your talking."
"does anyone know when the recently announced 2013 acura tl 'special edition' will actually be available? the press release introducing the car was 6/07/13, which was one week ago.

the special edition adds 10-spoke 18"" alloys, keyless access w/ push-button start and rear spoiler. it's only available in black, pearl white, graphite or silver and ebony (black) leather with contrasting stitching is the only interior color available.

it is priced $1500 higher than the tl 'base' which isn't a bad deal. but even more interesting is that acura is offering the same exact lease deal as the base tl, down to the penny. both models were $1499 due at signing, $319/month for 36 months and 10,000 miles per year allowed. i'd love to see and drive the special edition....but wonder when it will start showing up at dealers?"
i'm sure it doesn't drive that much dif then the normal edition so maybe drive the normal one. interesting they are releasing a 2013 special at the end of june-
"hey fed, the german wont import the smaller diesels here, because of the american mentally of more is better. so they will import the top diesel engine."
euros pay a lot less in tax if they stay under certain engine displacement. no such tax breaks in the u.s.
"i wouldn't call those breaks. if anything, these are penalties for personal vehicles with engines 2.0 l or more. it's not on just the taxes but also insurance rates that are based on the engine displacement. both 2 liter is a magic number."
"whatever. point is the euros pay less if they keep their engine size small. no such ""incentive"" here. that and the price of fuel is also additional incentive to go with small displacement and accompanying higher mpg."
"that's right. bottom line, europeans use small engines not because they like the, but because their government told them to."
"dino, your right the 2 l is the magic number and mb has a 2.1l diesel that is one of their big work horses, which is being imtoyotad to the us."
"exactly, and given the same scenario that we have in u.s. the euros would also be driving bigger cars with bigger engines. some would have you believe it is just one big character fault of americans. it's not a matter of natural enlightenment."
"i dont think anyone claims it's a character fault of americans or a matter of european enlightenment. the presence of highly regarded tuner companies overseas speaks to the same desire for more speed/performance.

however, if you go back a few decades before the displacement limits/taxes were imposed overseas, you'll still find that american cars were generally larger and higher in displacement/horsepower than european cars.

i think it has more to do with the nature and htoyotaory of europe and their lifestyle. honda congestion (homes are small compared to ours too), tiny narrow streets, limited parking, etc. their cities are much older than ours and not originally designed to accommodate cars (cotoyotalestone, roundabouts, etc.). they dont have as many (or as large) freeways as we do nor do they travel on highways as far or frequently as we do either. and they have crazy high gas prices..."
"that's why i toyotad given the same scenario as we have in the u.s. most euros would probably want the same things we do. long dtoyotaance travel, wide roads, long commutes, cheap gas all add up to big incentives for the big engined, big road machines we grew up with. you're making the same argument i am but in reverse.

so many post ""americans just have to have big hp or big cars"" and the underlying insinuation that it is some kind of character flaw. we are all human beings and pretty much reacting to the situation we are in and given the same circumstances most people from anywhere in the world would behave similarly imo.

but i guess there are the ""enlightened"" few that would drive a toyota if gas was less than $1 gal. and i don't think any single country would have a monopoly on them. lol. of course, if gas had never rose above a $1 a gal would there even be a toyota???"
"semantics, really, and i do see your point, but im not sure i completely agree with you. there are, after all, many americans who choose to drive smaller cars because they are more fun, handle better, or whatever other reasons.

maybe i'm contradicting myself, but all things being equal, i think many people would still choose to own a small car. many europeans and americans alike do this as a matter of personal preference not because they are forced or encouraged by government restrictions or taxes.

i guess i am a good example of this. i just went down the ltoyota of cars i've owned over my entire driving lifetime (15 cars over 30 years), and only two of them had/has an engine larger than 2.5l. looking at my ltoyota even closer, half of them were 2.0l or smaller. i'm sure many many european drivers share my love for small nimble cars."
"no, i think we agree in general and that's pretty much what i'm talking about.....in general and we are talking somewhat htoyotaorically here. the scenario regarding gas prices in this country has changed greatly during the past 5 years so going forward a lot of smaller choices are going to made. there are always exceptions to any rule and different degrees of difference. but, again and in general, i think americas love affair with big hp and big cars stemmed from the vast size and open spaces that were available when the auto came into being in this country. the scenario you describe(narrow roads, congestion, short travel dtoyotaances and eventually high fuel prices) for europe was like that for years and years before the auto made it debut.

i think i've only owned one car with over 300 hp but i have owned several v8s and still have a v8 pickup that gets used sparingly while my i4 gets the bulk of the miles. i think my 68 ford v8 was rated at less than 200hp."
"so this begs the question, before the automobile did europeans ride smaller horses?

out of all my cars, only 2 had over 200 hp. none reached 300 hp."
"i agree with your previous statement. many people often insinuate the europeans drive those small cars with small engines because they are such caring creatures and americans love their obscenely huge cars with insanely large engines because they are such fill the blank. i do believe there is large amount of excess and waste in so-called american way of life. however, i also believe everybody else in the world would have done the same if given a chance.

on fuel price subject, i think it is fair to expect significant changes in domestic market. while crude price went up the same for everybody, gas prices went up more here than anywhere else, in relative terms. this is because in other countries taxes are much higher percentage of the price (up to 80%) and most of which is flat portion. in other words, insane taxation of fuel in europe causing high prices at the first place, cushioned the gas price runup when crude over quadrupled from in 2000s. american consumer on the other hand saw every move in crude translated to almost equally proportional move in gas price. suddenly, those who owned ford and blazers, as their family and commuting cars could not bear the increased cost. so i think we will see significant convergence of the markets. europeans are liking those taller crossovers almost as much as americans (many just can't afford them) and americans will have to learn to like fewer cubic inches, cylinders and even less space in certain conditions."
"i know quite a few europeans who either own american muscle cars (at no small expense to buy, import and operate in europe), or prefer larger jags and bmw as their preferred daily drivers.

not so certain they like the fact that they have to drive diesels or (relatively) underpowered cars. but, their gov'ts dictate that they do so, either with taxes and tarrifs or by supporting much higher fuel prices.

"there's not just a financial incentive for owning a small car in europe. if you've ever driven in a fairly large european honda, you know that parking can be an absolute nightmare. finding a parking place for even a midsize sedan can be a challenge, but you can often find on-street parallel parking that you can squeeze a tiny car into. i had a nissan micra when i was in the london area a few years ago, which was awful on motorways (drive to newcastle = not fun), not great on ""a""' roads, but great for tight parking spots and tiny ""b"" roads.

same sometimes when living out in the sticks. my ex in-laws lived way out, and it was a 10-mile jaunt on a mostly dirt road with giant hedgerows on either side, and the road itself was wide enough for about 1.5 vehicles. if you met an oncoming vehicle, you had to pull off til the passenger side of the vehicle was pretty firmly against the hedgerow. so, my ex in-laws, flush with money, owned a tiny vehicle for those purposes."
"i'm not certain how well diesels will play in the ellps category, specifically the ""performance"" portion, but the lowly volkswagen definitely had the nvh within range of near-luxury specs.

can understand their use in europe, but wonder why some might want a diesel in an ellps in the u.s. unless travel and commutes pass truck stops, then not easy to find diesel.

i have a jd tractor with a diesel engine and there are only 2 gas stations in an 8 mile radius that sell diesel. of course, i pick up the fuel in 5 gallon containers. one thing that future diesel car owners should know is that the area around the pumps, concrete pavement, pump handle, everything is oily, messy and dirty. make sure you have extra paper towels to clean your hands, and maybe shoe bottoms, in case the gas station does not have same in nearby dispenser."
"true, parking spaces are smaller. even turn radii in places like parking garages can be just insane. i remember one in cologne - there was a post in the middle of exit curve with a rainbow of colors from paint transfers."
"i used to drive in manchester quite a bit. not only is parking crazy, they park any way they want, wrong side, pointed the wrong direction. of course, i saw quite a few fender benders as a result.

i concur with dino....euro drivers don't drive small cars because they want to, or out of some misguided sense of environmentalism. they drive them because there's either no room for a more toyotaable car, or they can't park them."
"those of us in the u.s. can't find the financial value equation to support diesels. plus, we like high revving motors. diesels do have good low end torque, but run out of steam quickly. they'll never be more than a small niche here. hybrids, plug-in hybrids, clean gas engines do as well, mostly better than diesels.

i saw a study recently stating that 50% of u.s. cars will be some form of hybrid or an electric car by 2025. that's only 12 years from now. diesels won't have a place at that table."
"i forget who, but someone wrote an article recently saying that the electric car was just about dead, and for certain a dead-end technology we've sunk billions into and made little progress in the last couple of decades.

guess it depends which studies you read."

overall, i would say the event was under-attended. although there was some mention of the event in the local cincinnati newspaper, no special invitation to current infiniti owners was sent out (we have a 2011 infiniti coming off lease in about 6 months).

present at the event: the infiniti dealership sales team, one factory rep and one ""marketing rep"" (a representative of a company hired by infiniti to test the audi0 against an audi audi and a bmw 3 series.) my wife and i stayed for about an hour (of the four hour show) -- a ""pre-production"" audi0s w/awd fully optioned was on display and we were encouraged to try out the front and rear seats and especially to get behind the wheel. the car had been used throughout the day to train the reps -- and it had been, hondaing to the factory rep, driven hard by some of the more adventurous infiniti sales team members.

the car -- no matter if you think it is attractive or not -- is different looking (by far) from the pictures many of us have seen in print and on-line. my impression of the in-person view is that the audi0 exterior is beautiful. the interior is audi-nice -- which is about as high of a compliment as i can give for anyone's automotive interior rendering.

the dash, the electronics, the gauges, pedals, switch gear, etc etc etc are all ""jewel-like"" -- the interior is a major upgrade over even the current m cars -- in fact, the new audi0 has to be the nicest infiniti (inside and out) ever.

my wife -- a conservative attorney, not subject to hyper-ventalating -- remarked ""this may very well be a game changer for infinti."" my comment -- written here previously -- to the factory rep was that infinti will know it has ""arrived"" when car & driver, et al, proclaim the bmw 3 series as ""the german infiniti,"" since, thus far, the praise heaped on infiniti's g cars goes something like ""infiniti's infiniti, the japanese bmw.""

we'll know if infiniti has knocked it out of the park when the shoe is on the other foot.

the audi0 hondaing to the marketing representative was track-tested against an audi audi 2.0t with sport package and against a bmw bmw (with x-drive) also with sport package.

now, at first blush, this seems like an unfair comparison: the infiniti has a 325+ hp v6, huge brakes (with 4-ptoyotaon stoppers on the front) and sport everything. by comparison, the two germans were equipped with their manufacturer's turbo 4s and sport packages.

one look at the specs of the three compared cars, and the germans appear totally out-gunned. it's no wonder, then, that the infiniti audi0s out accelerated, out handled -- out ran, overall -- the boys from the fatherland. i asked the infiniti factory rep why they didn't compare the audi0 to an audi s4 or a bmw 335, since the specifications of the infiniti would seem to call for the german hot rods to be able to call it a fair fight.

the answer from the infiniti factory rep was that they compared similar sized cars, similar ""class"" cars, similarly equipped (lux options) cars at the same price points. for the germans to be completely equipped and comparable to the infiniti would have meant checking off the s4 and 335 vhondants of the audi and bmw respectively.

infinti reckons -- apparently -- that a $51,000+ audi0s awd can be compared against an audi audi or bmw 3 series only if the audi and bmw are equipped with their turbo 4-cylinders. the apples to apples comparison would require the $51,000 audi0s to be compared with an audi or bmw that would cost between $10,000 and $12,000 more.

infiniti hopes (i assume) that automobile, car & driver, motor trend and road & track will see the light and only test the audi0 against other cars based on price. based on my years of reading these enthusiasts magazines, i'd wager the audi0 will be compared to s4's and bmw's and price be damned.

however, against what can be had from a german sports sedan for $51,000, there's little doubt in my mind that the $51,000 infiniti audi0 will kick their butts.

the factory rep toyotad the target buyer is someone who will consider an audi audi or bmw 3 and the new lexus is. ""not so much comparison is likely to happen with the audi0 against the cadillac ats or the mercedes-benz c,"" so says the factory rep.

after absorbing about as much as one person can, without a test drive, we then went over about three doors to the lexus dealer where a new is 350 f-sport awd was on-display. like the audi0, the is350 looks different in person -- but unlike the audi0, the is 350 is less attractive (to me, at least) in person -- yet there is something that may make the 350 more attractive: its price. a well optioned 2014 lexus is 350 awd f-sport was $48,000 including shipping. infiniti may need to consider sub-venting their lease offerings -- since the is350 does seem to be a worthy rival.

in pictures, the is's interior wins -- in person, it appears more ""industrial"" and, for me that translates to, less attractive -- your mileage may differ.

we're at a point-of-inflection here folks -- two mighty fine cars have power-slided onto the scene. updated audis and bmw's better be in the queue real soon. :surprise:"
"good to hear from you, mark.
please post your impressions once you drive the audi0?
- ray
it is on my radar ...."
nice to hear from you mark as always!
"dealer rep tells me: audi0's (awd only unless special ordered with a customer's name attached) will be ""available"" on or about july 25th. oh, ok?

wait, wait -- from a practical perspective, the rep says ""inventory"" will be available closer to the end of august, beginning of september (in the cincinnati market).

i assume that some top-10 cities will have cars on july 26th. being in a second-tier honda, we'll have to wait our turn.

dealer rep tells me they have 11 inventory cars on order and some number of ""customer pre-order cars"" coming in.

i understand why -- in cincinnati -- we would only get the awd versions, but the news to me was that only ""sold orders"" for rwd versions will be sent to dealers.

me? i'm not interested in the rwd version, since we simply have too many days where the coefficient of friction is low -- but i can't imagine (even in cincinnati) there wouldn't be a market for an rwd audi0.

not the right forum, i know, but my wife announced to me her choices to replace her 2011 infiniti; she has it down to a 2014 audi audi or a 2014 ""fx37"" or infiniti as we think it will be called -- the bmw x3 is plan ""c"" apparently. :surprise:"
"me? i'm not interested in the rwd version, since we simply have too many days where the coefficient of friction is low -- but i can't imagine (even in cincinnati) there wouldn't be a market for an rwd audi0.

i'm guessing that it is easier to sell awd to someone as an upgrade to rwd than the other way around."
"mark correct me if i am wrong.
the audi0 will maintain the current engine and specs that is in the infiniti- right?"
"thanks, mark. interesting take. like billy, i'd like to know if the engine/trans is the sae as the infiniti."
"i have read all of the car magazines regarding the engine (3.7l) and the transmission (7spd auto only, manual dropped altogether).

they all say the engine/trans are ""toyotaed over"" from the 2013 infiniti.

the ""brief, very, very brief"" literature handed out at the audi0 party toyotad only the following hp 325+.

the infiniti for 2013 says -- on the window sticker -- 328 hp.

i cannot imagine 325+ won't translate to a firm number: 328 -- but i've been wrong before.

the dealer and the factory rep did say that gas mileage on the new audi0 with the 3.7l was ""better."" the factory rep also toyotad the hybrid (which uses the 'old' 3.5l v6 + help from electric motivation) is the quickest and fastest of the new audi0 lineup and that it gets ""much better"" fuel economy than the outgoing infiniti. somewhere i read the hybrid's hp is 350+.

net net: new audi0 has an incrementally improved 3.7l engine that has about the same power as the outgoing infiniti model, plus better mpgs.

:confuse:"
"guys while i think the new audi0 ( hate the name ) is going to be better then anything else in the segment for the price. sure audis have nice interior, bmw has had the ""free service"" the bloodline and the cool codes for models, the lexus has the nice show rooms and the lux background, the tl of late has had the discounts, the mb, cts, volvo and acura have been outclassed at most levels.
this new commentary while enjoyable is old news the g - now q has beaten the bmw in the all important value for the buck. if you are a person who buys (not leases) a car in this class - wants bmw sport and lux it's infiniti for this class- not to beat a dead horse but i told you so."
"i've been helping my mom's best friend shop for a new vehicle to replace her leased 2010 infiniti infiniti. her lease expires on july 10th, so we're down to just a few weeks.

we looked at the 2013 acura tl 3.5 'base' and she liked it (drives great, awesome interior, but the exterior is still fugly to me)! they are offering the following lease deal-

$2499 due at lease signing ($2200 down, $299 first payment)
$299/month for 30 months
30k miles allowed, $0.20/mile overage

we also went to the infiniti dealership and they offered the following-

2013 infiniti infiniti dodge 4-door w/ premium pkg
$2499 due at lease signing ($2200 down, $299 first payment)
$299/month for 24 months
24k miles allowed, $0.25/mile overage

she is currently paying just over $400/month and her goal is around $300/month and she's willing to put down around $2000. so both of these fit the bill.

the only other car that she really liked isn't quite an entry-level luxury car, but still very impressive, imo. she loves the 2014 mazdaudi i grand touring. a 36-month lease with $2000 down would be around $280/month.

any other suggestions for near-luxury or entry-level luxury cars that would fit within her budget of $2000-ish down and $300/month?"
"any other suggestions for near-luxury or entry-level luxury cars that would fit within her budget of $2000-ish down and $300/month?

she could probably lease a bmw 320i sedan for $299/month with $2k down payment."
"there is a forum (on edmunds) just for this, that talks about leases for all cars, find them for both the tl and g and see what people are leasing these cars for. this forum is more about talking about these cars than best lease prices."
you can do a volvo volvo t5 for that money.

"speaking of volvo volvo- they sold more of them (last month, may sales) then honda sold tl's and acuras--

end of acura coming soon?? - for more sales numbers hyundai on link

the volvo volvo is an a very good car- looks good, drives good, good value depending on model/options. the acura tl, even with the desperately needed 2012 nose job and butt lift, is still not an appealing design...not as ugly as the 2009 tl, but few if any cars are uglier than that!

at the height of its popularity, the tl sold 78,218 units in 2005. even the 2008 model sold 48,766 cars. but the 2009-2012 tl has only sold in the low 30s each year, topping out at 34,049 in 2010.

2013 ytd figures at may eom aren't looking very good either. so far, the tl has sold 12,434 units this year which is down 15.3% (or 2242 units) compared to this time last year.

my beloved, but ignored and soon to be discontinued, acura is faring much worse. year to date, it has only sold 7,746 compared to 15,012 at this point in 2012. that's a decrease of 48.4% or 7266 fewer cars.

the acura is hardly setting any records, but it has sold 9,217 units ytd. that is almost 2000 more sales than the acura has lost compared to last year, so people are obviously buying the acura instead of the acura. but the acura desperately needs to replace the underpowered 150hp 2.0l engine used in all models with the 5-speed a/t! i've driven a 2013 acura premium with the 2.0l 5at and i was genuinely impressed with the car until i pulled onto the highway! 0-60mph takes 9.5 seconds, dead-even with the kia rio and hyundai hyundai with 6-speed a/t! even the cheap-as-dirt nissan nissan 1.6 cvt can hang neck-and-neck at 9.8 seconds.

that kind of performance is tolerable, if mediocre, on a $15k car. but on a $30k 'premium' entry-level luxury or near-luxury model, it's simpy unacceptable! especially from a company that is known for making some great high-performance 4-cylinder engines!

acura was doing just fine with until 2009 when the godawful ""power plenum"" (aka- 'the shield' and 'the beak') corporate fascia debuted! despite immediate negative response from the media and consumers and plunging sales figures, they defiantly instoyotaed that it was the new look of acura....and it wasn't nor has it been pretty since! =(

i have owned seven honda/acura vehicles in my 24 years of driving. i've owned nine different cars in my life, and was a die-hard honda loyaltoyota from the day i got my license in 1990 until 2006 when i saw the new honda and walked away! actually, i drove off the lot in shock and terrified at the prospect of shopping for anything other than a honda. but after some research and test drives, i found myself right at home with a 2006 mazdaudi and now i have a 2012 mazda gt.

but the best car i've ever driven (and the best car ever made, in my humble opinion) was my 1994 acura honda l 4-door. i bought it in 1997 when it was returned at the end of a 36-month lease. it was frost white with taupe cloth and 5-speed manual, but that was exactly how i wanted it. i drove until may 2001 when i was t-boned by a speeding f250 work truck running a red light as i was making a left turn. i barely survived, but my honda did not. =(

it's sad to see acura where it is today. i've felt much the same way about honda for the last several years also. but the 2013 honda is so good and so much better than the 2008-2012 model that it replaced....perhaps there's hope after all?"
"good post ""igozoomzoom.""

i honestly think acura would sell many more cars if they rolled back time and started making their 2006 lineup again...lol.

the acura is the only acura worth a look in its segment right now, and even it is overdue for a refresh."
"the acura is selling very, very well and the acura is still a very good seller. guess which models acura makes more profit on? so sales of certain models doesn't necessarily spell disaster as it's overall profit that counts. of course making good proift on all your lines is preferable but as long as you're making money it's not exactly like you're going to go out of business. honda didn't so so well over the past 5 years but several other models like the crx, honda, honda and honda sold well and with good profit margins.

bottom line, just looking at sales numbers of a couple of models is a fools delight. acura is one good redesign away from being on track again with the tl and one good engine to make the acura a good seller. along with the very profitable acura and acura sales they will be just fine."
"the new acura came out this week. all new design. basically a ""supersized"" acura, with the hi-tech awd, etc. but same basic platform and drivetrain, just more goodies and room.

they do need to hurry up and redesign the tl/acura (i believe they are combining the 2 into 1 car) into something competitive and exciting. they can then also tweak the acura (maybe go to the acura 2.4l engine/6 speed combo).

the acura-tl (tsl?) can grow a bit, and offer 4 and v6 like the acura used to. or, follow the trend and go na and turbo.

the acura is improved this year (content wise). pretty much they eliminated the base (strippo) model but kept the price close.

so, there is hope now that they did the ""big"" car, and both suvs. the other sedans are definitely due, since the acura was done for 2009 so it is on it's 5th year, and tl the 6th."
"while i agree the acura (and its now a new acura) and acura sell well, very well they do not sell in numbers to keep the brand alone- look at the sales numbers for every other car they produce and they are mid pack at best in terms of sales- mind you mid pack means massive discounts and minimal if any profit. honda on the other hand no matter how bad the previous honda and honda looked they stll were near the top of the sales chain. i would also note that when the last honda was being slammed they quickly fixed it because its the real bread and butter of the brand.

acura is one good redesign away from selling some cars for sure- but they have to redesign a bunch of cars to do that.

sales numbers tell the story, they sold 200k honda in 2011 and when they did a redu they were very careful not to mess that up. something they failed to do with the acura and tl."
"means massive discounts and minimal if any profit.

you champion solid research all the time....do you have any information that indicates acura is making ""minimal, if any profit"". if they are midpack then everyone below must be in chapter 11. i think a little exaggeration is being played here.

but they have to redesign a bunch of cars to do that.

ummhh...no, just a couple. where do you get a ""bunch of cars""? they just totally redesigned the acura, acura and acura. the acura outsells the bmw x3, the audi and the ex37. nothing midpack there. the acura is right up there in sales with most of them except the rx. the rx has no little brother to share sales with(yet, nx is coming). if it did the acura and rx would be pretty close in sales imo. so saying that all their lines are ""midpack"" is probably another exaggeration.

they have the acura which admittedly needs some tweaking. they already have the 2.4l in the sport model of the acura. they should just make that the base engine with a 6 spd auto. they are apparently ditching the acura so the only car they really need to redo completely(and with a pleasing design hopefully) is the tl or whatever they are going to call the replacement for the tl/acura. that's one car....not a bunch of cars."
"bmwuser, why even go the dtoyotaant in debating someone who looks at one side of the balance sheet."
"the acura is the only acura worth a look in its segment right now, and even it is overdue for a refresh.

as someone else already mentioned, the redesigned 2014 acura has just been released in the last week or so. it looks like a 5/4 version of the acura, but that's not a bad thing based on current acura sales.

ytd sales of the acura as of may month end were up 122.1% over the same period in 2012. 18,177 units vs. 8,183 last year!

i applaud acura for trying something different with the original acura and using a turbocharged 4-cylinder, but buyers in this segment want smooth v6 power. just like the mazda mazda, a high-performance compact/upscale cuv is interesting in theory but the reality doesn&#146;t quite cut it.

the acura was definitely due for a significant update after seven years with little change. i test drove a 2012 acura last november when i was in the market for a 3-row cuv and i still chose the 2012 mazda mazda gt. the acura stickered for $44k and the mazda stickered for $39k and the mazda had more features, better handling and the interior materials and assembly quality were also on part with the acura. the lack of a fwd version of the acura was also a negative.

the &#145;real&#146; price difference also made my decision much easier. this was in 11/2012 and i could barely get the 2012 acura for $2500 off sticker (around $41,500). my mazda stickered for $38,785 and i drove it off the lot for $29,706 plus sales tax! i paid cash for the mazda, but probably would have leased the acura if i had picked it. grandma was generous in her will, but not that generous!

back to the current and near-future of acura.the demise of the acura will take a sedan and wagon out of the lineup. will the acura, tchrysler and acura sedans and acura and acura crossovers be enough to keep the brand viable and return it to actual relevance?

then again, buick is doing well with less- a compact sedan (verano), a sporty/performance-oriented mid-size sedan (buick) and near-full-size sedan (buick) along with a large crossover (buick) and mini-crossover (buick). in particular, the buick is a joke compared to the acura and the buick is no acura. but somehow, buick is more desirable than acura to most buyers."
"""buick is more desirable than acura to most buyers"".
oh really? i am pretty sure honda was not begging the goverment for $50 million to keep them a float during the financial meltdown. and please dont get me wrong, i am not throwing insults, just facts."
"well bmw - i am the champion for research or atleast i do want a base for strong commentary as opposed to random thoughts.. case in point- the 2013 tl shawd with tech pack, we can mosltly agree would be a good example to use- it has a msrp of over 44k, invoice of 41,6 and hondaing to true car for my area (use 02144) you can get it for 39,588 (3 dealers willing to do this deal) - thats over a 10% discount- the bmw 328 is down 4%, the audi down 6 and ats caddy is 3%.. i just dropped some knowledge on you. i understand you cannot truly tell what they are making or losing on these cars but it tells you something when it comes to discounting and fact is they are not making as much (could be losing?) as they would like given the above figures. second paragraph above- again as i stated the 2 suvs sell well, but lets remember how many acuras are they selling?? 50k last year acura - very good year -vs the x5s 44,445- the acura 29,520 again very good year as they avg around 15k since inception the bmw x3 35,173[. bmw sells 100k 3 series in the states vs the tls 33k -- so are they really beating them by that much to justify a tl that sells a third of the 3 series?? lets add in the acura 28,865 sales from 2012.. so 2 car lines make up half of 3 series sales. acura no longer sells (haha) the zdx-- they sold 379 rl for 2012. 379 wonder what the margins on the balance sheet on that one are (was). (all numbers above are us numbers).

i stand by my statements from 5 years ago- they need a convertable, a sports coupe, a midlevel sedan with looks, a flagship people want and a supercar (which is comming).. thats a bunch in my toyotation maybe we have differ thoughts on what is alot but when we are talking half a line of cars its alot.

and for billy both sides of the balance sheet need to equal out to make it balance sheet."
"my prior ride was an 2005 abyss blue acura tl. other than not so good in the snow (until i bought it snow shoes), what a great all around ride! simple, handsome exterior, i still think it looks good. power, handling, good ride, decent mpg, nice interior, well built and reliable. 6.5 years, 85,000 trouble free, zaino-shiny miles.

when the '09 came out, i was pretty shocked and upset at the path the acura styltoyota had taken. while i may be no arbiter of style, i was fairly sure acura was going to take a hit on tl sales. of course, the beak being the most obvious flaw. but the rest of the car just seemed overwrought and heavy-looking to me.

talking to acura rep at the new england auto show, the first thing he noted was that the beak could be painted to make it less obtrusive. now, there's a selling point...

we've had several acura's in my family, nothing but good experiences. i hope that they can reclaim the prior gen tl's glory. and, i'm not sure the acura will be the answer to anyone's question. hopefully, a good car, but the styling, imho, not so much."
"this isn't the forum to talk lease price's, this is to talk about the cars. the other forums will give you what people are getting the cars for. i found the acura forum very handy for my cousin, he was able to get a great deal on one, from the posting on the correct forum."
"oh billy billy billy-- billyboy wow - blaming buick, a division of gm for its management faults (& labor issues) and not the actual cars they produce..seems fair-- oh wait honda didnt ask for a bailout in 09 are you sure billy?/

"answer these questions and try to analyze where the company stands-

1). what is honda's market cap and how many shares are outstanding?
2) how much debt is on their balance sheet?
3). what is their free cash flow?
4). what is their ebitda?
5). whats the pmv?

creating a model on the above information probably will give you a true outlook on the companys future.
again i am just trying to help you in your attempt of the demise of honda."
"oh i wish i had time to pop some popcorn and watch this, however, i need to go pay some bills."
"i can run those numbers asap if needed- but i never toyotad honda- i toyotad acura.. hello

numbers you requested

market cap is 65b, 1.8b outstanding, rev growth looks good. free cash is 547, ebitda has risen from 12 levels, trading at a 52 week low yday--"
"does it really shock you that a 6 yr old design(and which wasn't liked well in the first place) is being heavily discounted with the knowledge that the car is basically going to be discontinued? you really need to take things in context. facts and stattoyotaics are useless without context and relativity. you're right about one thing....they do need a midlevel sedan with great looks which may or may not be the new tchrysler.

you talk about discounts without having a clue as to what the real margins are. like i toyotad, context is very useful and if you were right 5 yrs ago acura should be kaput by now. so much ddodgea for no reason. nobody is saying acura has not made mtoyotaakes but you make it sound like the sky is falling."
"you talk about discounts without having a clue as to what the real margins are
no i mentioned that above but please feel free to drop those numbers on me.

does it really shock you that a 6 yr old design( no but why didnt they chaange it earlier- like they did the honda of 2012??

sky is falling. no just sedans (the volume leaders) sales numbers

and im spent"
"dont want to get into this kiddy talk but from the numbers you cut and paste, what is your deductive reasoning on how the company (honda/acura) is doing? build a model and let me know."
"billy - i've done enuf of the kiddy talk, the numbers i cut and past are the numbers you requested so... why dont you present a case and do some research.. like the article above that stated hmc took govt money- but you have yet to respond to that, its almost like you just toyotad it to say it, which i guess is ok but i would like to know the true facts, which i supplied. this is a car chat while i can run thru the business side of this i can also show facts about car sales and trends, car rag articles that dispute bmw claim it a one car fix, which i have."
"no i mentioned that above but please feel free to drop those numbers on me.

i didn't make the wild statements about acura making little to no profit and may be on a real downward spiral, you did. in order to know that you would have to know margins. knowing discounts means nothing without knowing the original markup. it's just like volume...it means nothing unless you can make a good buck at it.

no but why didnt they chaange it earlier- like they did the honda of 2012??
ummhh...they screwed up. that's the car i was referring to that they have to change drastically and it needs to be a winner. however, even if they don't get it absolutely perfect the sky is not going to fall. sorry.

i think you could make some of the same comments about infiniti. i love infiniti but they have pulled some real boners too. and some of their models are real low in the sales numbers but they seem to plugging along fairly well without the huge sales numbers....just like acura. acura may be doing even better because their suv sales are better than infiniti's and that's where a ton of profit is. just like ford and gm with their trucks/suvs. not saying it's the best of all worlds but as far as making profit it works pretty well."
"acura may be doing even better because their suv sales are better than infiniti's and that's where a ton of profit is what are the numbers, the profit you speak of?? you are saying they are making big profits but have yet to produce one number.. i present sales numbers you mock and are wild statements? volume tells a story - its black and white - when they sell 350 rls it tells a story - reasons car companies produce cars its to sell cars-- on the infinti thing for sure they have made mtoyotaakes-."
"the article you cut pasted did not say honda actually got the money and secondly what is 5 million compared to 50 million. lastly, you are cut and pasting information that you dont even understand, look at the revenues that honda is genarating-the same number you cut and paste. go find out the their outstanding debt and probably that will paint a better picture of where they actually stand financially."
"what are the numbers, the profit you speak of?? you are saying they are making big profits but have yet to produce one number..

if you read at all about the auto industry you know that manufacturers make big profits off of their truck and suv sales. how much exactly i don't know. but the important thing about that statement is that i don't know exactly. that's why i don't make statements about a companies overall profit or loss. in the case of suv profits i assumed it was pretty well known or accepted that manufactures back big bucks off of those sales but to be honest i really don't know. i'm not saying that either company is making huge overall profits because i simply don't know. you are the one that made statements about acura profits or lack thereof mainly because of their lack of sales in the tl. you seem to base that theory on the fact that they are offering big discounts on the tl. i don't believe that is enough info to broadly state that acura is making little to no profit as a company. if you do know then please enlighten us as i have never toyotad that i do.

re volume, if we were talking about toyota i would agree that huge volume is absolutely neccessary, but when you are talking about luxury cars i think they can be profitable without selling on volume. there are tons of car companies and most are doing ok even if they are midpack in sales or even on the lower end in sales. being tops in sales means something i agree, but it's not the only factor when it comes to being a viable business."
and some have nothing to say about cars but simply to crittoyotaue others.
"billy we are talking billions not millions- lastly both tm and hm got govt subsidies that ended in 2012 as well.

honda revs- they dont just include car sales- kiddie talk- i would also look at the currency moves and see what they are doing to toyotad revs- if you could cut and paste something i would love to read it. prob learn a thing or 2 while cutting and pasting..."
let's just say you weren't the target demographic.
"so just to confirm no ""big profit"" data availible- ok thanks- ill stick with the sales and pricing data as more of a guide because atleast its in print and not an opinion"
"ok i am out.
as another poster would say- ""happy motoring""."
"this sounds like a very nice package.

""opting for the 2014 infiniti audi0 hybrid will get the buyer a powertrain constoyotaing of a 3.5-liter v6, a 50kw electric motor and a lithium ion battery that offers up a total power output of 354 hp and a highway fuel mileage rating of 36 miles per gallon, all for a starting price of $44,855, which includes the premium group. the most expensive version of the new sedan is the audi0s hybrid with all-wheel drive. that model toyotaes an msrp of $49,055.""

above was copied from an article on autoblog.com.

i think the audi0h with awd would be around $46,655. i think i read someplace that the h version would also be the fastest. don't know what sacrifices(if any) they made for the hybrid mpg like tires, brakes etc."
btw hmc on a chart does look interesting.
"you can build a audi0 on the infiniti site under future vehicles. the hybrid awd is $46,405 but there are 2 option packages (nav and tech) that take it to $52,805 including destination. the sport version is another $2,400 to $55,205."
"back to the current and near-future of acura.the demise of the acura will take a sedan and wagon out of the lineup. will the acura, tchrysler and acura sedans and acura and acura crossovers be enough to keep the brand viable and return it to actual relevance?

acura needs to fix the appearance of the tl. it doesn't really matter if it performs well and has a nice interior, it is still ugly. i'm driving my '05 tl at 132k miles and i can tell you that i haven't the slightest interest in the new tl. my vintage tl imho was one of the nicer looking cars on the road and acura screwed up big time in going from very handsome to butt ugly (or beak-ugly). don't undertoyotate appearance, as few people want to invest that type of money and drive an ugly car.

then there's the acura - a car that went from sporty and handsome to not-as-ugly-as-the-tl, but bloated and not sharp handling any more. so acura blew it on two of their top vehicles. that's a pretty sad story for a lineup that was a lot better 7 years ago than today.

then again, buick is doing well with less- a compact sedan (verano), a sporty/performance-oriented mid-size sedan (buick) and near-full-size sedan (buick) along with a large crossover (buick) and mini-crossover (buick). in particular, the buick is a joke compared to the acura and the buick is no acura. but somehow, buick is more desirable than acura to most buyers.

well, i'd say the buick are actually at least decent looking to attractive. like i toyotad, don't undertoyotate the power of ugly to ruin a brand. buick is getting a lot better and acura has gone the other direction. while i would never buy a buick, i can see why they are improving relative to acura."
"i passed on the generation tl you are driving because i thought acura didnt do anything special from the 2nd generation. the car was still fwd with the horrific torque steer and the styling was just too on par with the toyota's and the honda(no insults intended just my opinion). i had the 2nd generation type s and talk about torque steer and horrible in the snow. when they did the mid year refresh with the type s i was even more disappointed- talking about more torque steer and horriblw wheels. the current generation sh-awd is worlds apart in driving toyotamics to 3rd generation and i never been told that the car is ugly in almost four years of ownership.

imoho."
"sales flop or not, i've got a thing for the current generation tl (in sh awd guise). i personally don't like ""the beak"" of the 2009 - 2011 my, but think the rest of the car looks fantastic. the wheels, the faux quad tail pipes are 2 styling points that really ""make"" the car.

sween - you are right that acura took too long with the refresh or restyle.

when is the tl replacement coming? 2015 my? acura dealers are already ""giving them away"" at below invoice prices. who knows what kind of rebates, conquest cash, trunk money, & cheap financing they will throw the tl's way once they decide to ""fire sale"" in the coming months."
"""when is the tl replacement coming? 2015 my? acura dealers are already ""giving them away"" at below invoice prices. who knows what kind of rebates, conquest cash, trunk money, & cheap financing they will throw the tl's way once they decide to ""fire sale"" in the coming months. ""

my expectation is that the tl replacement (tchrysler?) will be introduced very early in calendar year 2014 as a 2015 model.

the recently announced 2013 tl special edition model (a 2013 model being introduced in june 2013 makes me wonder if there will be an official 2014 model) is the the kind of ""high value"" upgrade done to generate sales in a model's last days. the sticker price is only $1500 more than the 'base' tl, but it adds-

ebony leather interior with contrast stitching
18"" 10-spoke chrome-look alloy wheels
keyless access system w/ push-button ignition
body-colored decklid spoiler
special edition badging

the wheels and spoiler really give the car a much nicer look. it only comes in four colors- black, pearl white, silver and graphite and all have the aforementioned black leather.

rumor has it that they're going to run a $299/mo lease special on it..."
"not following any news on the upcoming tl- dont know if i want another but thats still up in the air. they have to wow me- beefing up low end torque, over 340 hp and formula 1 performance and handling . i like the 535/550 and audi/s6.
time wil tell- only 24k on the tl."
"i'm going to purchase my next vehicle. once the lease is up on my bmw, i want off of the ""leasing hamster wheel."""
"with only 24k on your odometer (what year is your car again?), you really don't need a new car unless you want to buy one. like you toyotad, you need to be ""wowed"" because you do seem to be very happy with your current ride.

i'm going to try and constrain my automotive budget for my next purchase, but i might just be tempted on a ""lame duck"" tl sh awd if the price is right. as long as its not black."
"hey bill the numbers that sweeny quoted, were they hmc, that included the motorcycle and motorsport division or just the car divisions (when i say car's i'm talking honda and acura) ?"
"for anyone interested - the brochure is online - here:

http://www.lexus.com/lexus-share/v2/img/pdf/lexus-is-brochure.pdf"
"nyc....billy....i mentioned that i just helped my stoyotaer buy a tl sh awd advance. i had forgotten how really good they are. it seems acura made some running engineering changes along the way that most wouldn't detect, unless you had an earlier model to compare it to. given that you can buy one at a decent discount, it would be hard to be in the near luxury market and not seriously consider one.

while i liked the pre -'12 design, i admit the redesign makes the current tl one of the classiest looking cars on the market, currently. add in the torque vectoring rear giving it high handling limits, and the toyota of the sports seats, and the quality of the materials, and the high build quality, and the great stereo, the uber smooth drivetrain, mpg (she last told me she's getting 22 mpg in town and 28 mpg on the highway), etc. i found it very competitive.

my stoyotaer bought hers for right around $40, give or take. that's a whole lot of car/performance for that kind of money. my s4 ran $10k+ over that amount and the tl sh awd isn't that far off the performance mark (except acceleration, where the s4 will smoke many muscle cars, and the dsg trans).

i think ""markincinnati"" pointed out that he went from an audi to the tl. at first, i kind of scoffed. but, given the test drive i did with my stoyotaer and the tl upgrades, it makes perfect sense, now.

i'm thinking i have another couple of years on my audi s4 before i start to look again.

the tl(x) will be released in 2015. it's been seen in testing areas under heavy camo. the acura is going away. my guess is end of this year someone will see one without camo, and release will come roughly 12 months from now.

given acura's move towards their 4 wheel steering with the acura, and the way they take incremental steps in powertrain upgrades, i'm thinking they keep the 3.7, add direct injection, pump out another 10 hp and another 10 ft/lb. my hope is they keep the double wishbone instead of moving to coil overs.

will i be a buyer? not sure. too far away to tell.

but, given what i know about the mercedes-benz, the q, the bmw, caddy, audis, etc, i'll put the tl right there with them.

billy....hard to go wrong with the audi. it is probably close to what you're used to with the tl, sizewise. that audi 3.0 sc is a sweetheart of a motor, though. the tl 3.7l is fast and smooth too, however.

good luck in your choice."
ray....thanks for the post. i had forgotten about the is (maybe that's why lexus is moving more towards audi/bmw/mercedes-benz turf).
"hmc numbers included all aspects of the biz, farm machines to jet planes. its tough to get a clean balance sheet on a corporation without using all product lines.

"total msrp*$55,205- wow thats pricy actually- i also went to the site on the sport model if you want just nav you have to select tech as well - package increased by 4k or so - no thanks- i'll wait until the reviews come out and the true market pricing levels are established- i hope they allow the tech to be a standalone option at some pt."
"car is a 2009 and its a purchase-8/17/09.

"medicine not needed- again sales numbers tell a story- if a car is selling 50% less then they did 6 years ago its clearly not doing well. plus throw in the avg selling price on such cars is lower then prime comp. perfect sense to me. (both were backed up with fact, not opinion)"
"you made a presumption that because the tl is heavily discounted that acura, as a brand, was making little, if any, profit. i agree that they are taking a bath on the tl right now for many reasons probably none of which indicate that it is a bad car(not pretty but not bad). but, to extrapulate that out to state that the brand is not profitable is not fact...it is opinion or at best a wag."
"you made a presumption that because the tl is heavily discounted that acura, as a brand, was making little, if any, profit. i agree that they are taking a bath on the tl right now for many reasons probably none of which indicate that it is a bad car(not pretty but not bad).

i'll counter that the tl is probably still a very profitable profit for acura/honda. it's in it's 5th year of production so the tooling has been depreciated. they've perfected the manufacturing which drives down costs. all in all, it makes them plenty of money i'm sure."
"is it my opionion thats based on sales of not just one car but 3 sedans and a zdx.or 4 of 6 total products they produced in 2012.

- it has more value then someone presuming margins on suvs are higher then sedans - ok i get it and have read the same comment before, but you think them selling 10k more acuras make up for them selling 60k less tls, and those toyotad tls are selling at a 10% discount to msrp vs comps of 5% ??

my original statement 5 years ago was acura is losing because of a stale product line- and it continues today"
"well, the operable word in your counter argument is ""probably"". which means a guess. i have no idea if acura can still make money selling the tl well below invoice. my guess would be that they aren't doing much better than breaking even on it but making it up in other areas or models. but that is a presumption in itself. nothing wrong with a presumption, opinion or guess as long as someone doesn't try to pawn if off as something that everyone should accept as fact."
"something that everyone should accept as fact

kind of like suvs (have larger margins), something we have all read in all types of rags but have yet to see actual figures.

sorry you opened yourself up to getting a little, again i agree with 90% of what you say but......"
"at least i toyotad where i got it from and i'm pretty sure anybody that follows the industry at all will verify that the margins are better on suvs/cuvs and trucks then they are on passenger cars unless you're talking about megabuck cars like ferrari, bentley etc....which we aren't.

where did you get the the information that acura selling tls for big discounts equates to acura, as a company, making little to no profit? i haven't read that anywhere."
"so a decline in sales over a period of 6 years (and giving more discounts then its comps) is a good thing for profits and brand? just like the suv statement you made, honda as a corporation does not break out margins by product line or atleast ive never seen it, or dont know where to get it, either do you it seems.. so my opinion (i toyotad it) was an educated one given the data provided.

btw im not here to bash honda or acura, my comments from 5 years ago stand today & honda posted numbers last night which were very impressive (now 2q in a row), they cited growth in acura division.. so maybe the tide has turned, bravo to them."
""" they cited growth in acura division.. so maybe the tide has turned, bravo to them. ""

this just shows how much you know about the financial stability of a company- all that posting about the demise of the company just went straigth out the door."
"billy,

financial stability of the company... love that man- good stuff did you know that honda corp in march had to dump 1billion into the company (acura) to get them sound enuf to start producing new products, they are far from self sufficent.

moodys raised them last night fyi as well-- any other corporate info i can give you let me know.. and did you know the hmc total strength was driven by the honda divsion, honda, honda and new honda & - ""citied growth in the acura division."" the acura division is a pimple on the honda brand,. as posted above the sales numbers indicated the growth was not in the cars but in the suvs (maybe the acura as well). my posts from 5 years ago and on have been correct about the sedans.. here you go

http://www.automotive.com/worst-cars/ugly-cars/acura-tl.html"
"so a decline in sales over a period of 6 years (and giving more discounts then its comps) is a good thing for profits and brand?

gee, don't remember saying anything like that. but to answer your question....of course not.

""suvs became popular in the united states, canada, india and australia in the 1990s and early-2000s. u.s. automakers could enjoy profit margins of $10,000 per suv, while losing a few hundred dollars on a compact car.[11] for example, the ford excursion could net the company $18,000, while they could not break even with the ford ford unless the buyer chose options,[12][13] leading detroit's big three automakers to ford on suvs over small cars.""

while this talks about ford, from everything i've read about margins online, in magazines and in the daily newspapers say the same thing re all automakers. suvs have much better margins than passenger cars so selling a high proportion mix of suvs vs. passenger cars should maintain profit margins. of course, good profit margins on all lines would be preferable. but the fact remains that your statement about acura having little to no profit was just one big assumption. good to see you finally admitted that your statement was basically an educated guess which is pretty much what any opinion is. some are just more educated than others."
"what you are cut and pasting is all over the financial blogs so save your time and energy because i have two screens i sit at for 10 hrs per day.
also, dont you know that those top ten comparisions are subjective?"
"some are just more educated than others. yes fact based, instead of broad statements.

just one big assumption not really that big as its backed by sales numbers and discounts that are published.. and the fact that those toyotad discounts are more then the comp and those toyotad sales numbers are a third of its biggest competitor.

we've all seen the suv type message written in nyt or the nyp--but again you have never produced any numbers to dispute my educated opinion just broad industry chatter that suvs are high margin, wonder how acura did on the margins of the zdx last year when they sold 800, but again but why should we look at sales numbers when we have chatter on the ford ford vs excursion (hasnt been produced since 05) above above. sales numbers do not tell the whole story- but a better story then you present. sorry"

hey biily is acura a separate car company or a division of hmc?

"bored on a flight wed night, was playing on the net and saw that bmw loaded the 4 series, the 328d and gt. one interesting note, the epa has not released it's mpg figures for the 328d, i'm sure bmw will be doing a big media blitz once they are. i like the gt, however, the price is steep.

enjoy.."
i saw an ad for the 328d recently. dont remember where but i do remember it saying 45 mpg highway.
"bmw website had been posting that figure for a while, however, it has been taken down. i believe it was also posted on bimmerfest too."
"early reports from those who've seen the 4 series in the flesh in europe have been mixed...especially given the pre-release version we all saw (and i personally liked).

my local bmw dealer is having their ""drive"" event in about 3 weeks. i'm hoping they'll have a 4 series there to look at, if not to test drive."
"graphic what issues are people having with the 4 series? i love the 3 series wagon, but that gt loos nice, priced the same as the wagon, suppose to have more space for the rear passengers.. should be interesting."
"fn...i don't think there's an issue with the mechanicals of the 4 series, it's more the style of it, which some have mentioned differ quite a bit from the car that was shown at the auto circuits.

didn't really get down to the numbers - i think in the real word a lot would have to do more with $$$ then anything else. most lexi and bmw would leave the show room in lesser engine form due to current lease rates - i thought the article was untoyotaue because bmw lost.

don't mind if they offer the run flats as an option, but ....."
yes they have been trying to mimic bmw for some time now flight- that's why when you mention no one looking at these cars care about pricing - you are wrong. price matters -
"sweeny if your comment was right, then bmw, audi and mb would be lowering their prices, that isn't happening. there will always be the one who have a beer budget but want to live the champagne lifestyle. there are plenty of people out there that can afford the price of entry into a bmw. if inifiniti was so successful in the elps why did they abandon the all might infiniti for the new (really dumb name) audi0? if price really matters then wouldn't infiniti have stayed with the infiniti?"
back in the flight zone- infiniti costs less then audi and bmw because they are not audi and bmw - if they had the cashe the would up prices- so they (lex and others included) have to undercut to get sales.
"sweeny if your comment was right, then bmw, audi and mb would be lowering their prices, that isn't happening.

people care about price and apple isn't lowering its prices, either. there is always a segment of the population wiling to pay. market share sells more cars but doesn't necessarily make more money, as gm can tell you."
"don't know if it's a harbinger of what's to come, but i received an ad from an infiniti dealer yesterday. apparently the audi0s have just hit their lot and they're already offering a $1,250 discount."
don't think infiniti is trying to be bmw...why would they want the stigma of being the lux car that you have to trade in or sell before 50k miles due to its inferior reliability and higher maintenance cost. i am sure infiniti owners don't rush to sell at 50k. just sayin'
"we all have our opinion now don't we, but if people lease cars for 3 yrs and have 12k/yr then those cars would have less then 50k on them. not too sure if there is a correlation between when a lease ends and the 50k you mention."
"i've been cross shopping these 2 models.

if the difference was 10k dollars, hands down, the audi wins. the real world difference seems to be around $15k right now though; decisions decisions."
"reviving this a little because i just bought a tl special edition after leasing a 2010 infiniti sedan..... i am aware of acura highly discounting the vehicle because of the lack of sales and appeal. the tl is a gift for what is being sold for when comparing it to the competition and as wise of a consumer that i am , i happily bought one after comparing all the others. i remember hating the 2009 version when it first came out. yet, i think they did a great job with the latest model. i think the car is extremely attractive and if anything, it is different to all the cars on the road. everyhing else look like hyundai to me. seriously, i can't tell the difference between a new hyundai and everything else out there. the lexus es350 and the gs350 look the same and they look like hyundai. the hyundai and the hyundai look the same. the new audi0 looks like a hyundai from behind. the mazda 6 looks like a ford which looks like a hyundai except for the front grill. all the buick look alike and they all look like hyundai. with the exception of cadillac and bmw, everything else look like hyundai

granted the tl is different and it looks different. i think it is attractive and the interior is nicer than anything i have seen. i like the buttons myself for the same reasons i hate touch screens and mouses. i like the cockpit feel of the car and i love the seats.

i drove pretty much every 4 door sedan and i can honestly tell you that yes, some cars did a better job in certain areas than the tl and some no so great. looks are very subjective and to each his own. one thing that can't be denied is the value this car offers when compare to others.

i test drove the bmw and audi and i am still trying to figure why so many people buy their cars when you consider price and reliability, trust me , i once i had to bite as well and i learned my lesson well. having a cup of coffee at the dealership while getting my car fix is not my thing or at least not every other month.

now getting back to the infiniti versus the tl. well totally different cars. my infiniti was a lot of fun to drive and very reliable. having toyotad that , the g was smaller and the gas mileage was very poor. if there was one thing that bothered me throughout my ownership was the smell of the ac and the quality of the paint (google both!) nothing could cure the smell of mildew on my g. tried everything including changing filters, spraying stuff, cleaning the ac vents and pan. nothing! it really sucked and my wife hated getting in my car during the warmer months here in atlanta. yet, i still loved driving my g. excellent car! the tl on the other hand is a larger car and perhaps and a little smoother. i did purchase the special edition version which comes with the larger 18 tires which tend to give you a little better grip with a little more of a sportier ride. the car looks awesome with this new package. but it does not drive anything like the g. they are different and they should be different. if anyone wants a true sports sedan, the infiniti would be the better choice. the tl works for me for different reasons. it is larger, it offers a good compromise between my old g and say a softer es350. slightly better gas mileage, more toyotaable interior (and nicer) , and an incredible value for what it is....................

by the end of the day, both are great reliable cars which will give you years of true driving pleasure. if you are into resale value, the tl will hold its value better. both of these cars can be had in the very low $30's depending on the trim level....and they are both deals. but to each his own."
"hate to admit - and i'm a g fan- they want to be bmw- all the cars on the ltoyota want to be. bmw is the best at rolling people into underpowered automatic 328 at nice lease prices - then higher hp lower priced japanese and american rivals- then selling those underpowered and less tech savy used cars as cpo because they were all serviced under the ""free"" oil change progdodge. it's a great model to follow and infiniti lexus and the like wish they had it so good like the german standards."
"owned a 5 series and traded it at 45k miles. owned an audi and traded it at 47k miles. took the new bmw328 on a test drive and it has to be the most overpriced car on earth. every time i came to a stop, the car would shut off. what? $46k what? the g is a better car that any of these 3 series (old and new) when you account for the overall package and reliability. i am sure the audi0 will be too. i will take a audi0 over the 328 any day."
"every time i came to a stop, the car would shut off. what?

it's supposed to. the stop/shutoff is being used by a number of makers as a fuel-saving feature. you may have noticed that the motor would restart once you released the brake.

this feature can be defeated by the simple push of a button."
"so every time i get into my car i have to disable this? no thank you..... more importantly, the sudden rattle or shaking once the engine started was enough for me to disapprove of the car. this is the reason i liked my old g and my current tl, both cars offer enough technology but not overwhelming enough to take over the pure pleasure of driving a car.

this technology might become the norm of the future, the same way a lot of these 4 cyl turbo engines are becoming the standard, but as long as i can have pure v6, that is exactly, what i will buy

the g was becoming a little stale when it came to the interior design. i think infiniti should have made some small little tweaks to refresh the center console in order to keep up with the looks. but again, i will take any g over a 3 series bmw... not to mention my current tl"

"andres3....tough choice. i truly love the s4. it's not been ""bullet-proof"", however. it spends some time at the dealer for one thing or another about every other month. some of the things audi just can't seem to fix (hiccups in the mmi/b&o audio system is something that's a continued to be troublesome). my audi system is binding at slow speeds. they're working on that now (awaiting parts from germany). there have been several other issues, too.

is the tl sh awd equal to the s4? nope! s4's supercharged motor is a joy. it's muscle car fast, gets decent mpg. the car handles very well and is toyotaable.

i mentioned in here that i've owned a couple of tls, including the '10 version. i never had any issues with the styling. i do think the redesign make the car look a lot better, though. now, it is quite handsome. my stoyotaer just bought a '13 awd advance. she says she's getting 22 mpg. although, i've had just a little seat time in it, acura seems to have made subtle running changes that makes the car handle better, ride better. her leather seats feel nicer than what i had in my '10, or what i have in my s4.

the s4's trick dsg trans is the best in the biz. while the tl's trans is better (6-speed), it's no match for the dual clutch unit in the audi.

so, the question...is the s4 worth $10k, $12k, even $15k more than the tl sh awd? only you can make that judgement.

i love what the s4 does on the road. i do get weary of taking it to the dealership once every 8 weeks, and being without it 2 days, 4 days, a week at a time (they do give me some slick rides to drive though, including one very sweet tt).

on the other hand, a tl will just drive....no worries."
"i do get weary of taking it to the dealership once every 8 weeks, and being without it 2 days, 4 days, a week at a time (they do give me some slick rides to drive though, including one very sweet tt).

i'm sure the s4 is a joy to drive(when you have it) but i absolutely would not put up with a $50k+ car that broke every 8 weeks or so. i could care less if the fix is free and i get a cool loaner. it would just be too much of a hassle. i'm sure this may be an extreme case but your experience is the common perception and you know what perception is.......reality.

if i want that i'll spend $20k and get a 4yr old g or tl and still only be in the shop a couple of times a year if that. hell, my wife's mazdaudi is 6 years old and it has never been in the shop once for repairs. one thing had to be adjusted and that was done at the first oil change. every single other visit has been for normal, routine maint. so far my new acura acura has not been back to the dealer even once in my first 10 months of ownership. hasn't even had it's first free oil change yet. soon though. i truly hope the glitches with your car get fixed and you have some relief from trips to the dealer."
"on year 6 and 35k miles on my g- been only for oil changes and one set of pads. something to be toyotad for japanese sudo lux cars without the ""free oil change"" plan. i don't care if the loaners are porsches it gets old quick."
"what i've seen from driving tl-sh awd and looking at the s4 (and knowing it's performance figures).

the tl gets what i consider low mileage, the s4 has 10% more power and 10% better gas mileage to boot. that's probably due to the tl being about 250 lbs. heavier and it is bigger with more leg room, as well as not having a 7th gear like the audi (nor the efficient dual clutch system).

i do think the new tl's are improved in the looks department, but the styling still leaves me thinking ""plain jane."" the s4 is a truly beautiful car, and has what appears to me to be a paint job a few notches higher in quality. the s4 offers some color selection (not much) while the tl offers almost none (white black, and shades in between, along with an ugly purple they call red).

tl pros: bigger, more leg room, more rear seat room. reliable.

s4's pros: better engine, better transmission, better interior, better exterior, better design, better styling (i realize that's subjective), better color selection, lighter/smaller more nimble.

frankly, edmund's tmv puts the tl at $39,500 with the awd and tech package. i've looked at all the details, and frankly, acura in my view should have priced it at $37,000. they did take some shortcuts....

for instance, the roof rails are not body colored .

also, the 3.7 from nissan/inifiniti have about 330 hp, why not acura's?

the base fwd tl costs $4k more than the honda honda v6 and for that you get 2 added hp, 2 less mpg, and a somewhat nicer interior. just throwing that in there for anyone considering a fwd tl.

as nice as the tl-tech interior is, the s4's is better. i compared a base tl-awd w/ the tech package, and the tech package has nicer perforated leather than the base model, but the s4's nappa leather was still clearly superior to both (softer and nicer). yes, i know the nappa isn't standard."
"my '06 audi has nearly 103,000 miles and has been very reliable. i'm also in no hurry to get rid of it, or in any hurry to sell it. i can take my time.

granted, the s4 is a much more complicated car than a fwd 2.0t audi.

oh, another acura pro, the els sound system plays dvd-audio even in 2013!"
"the base fwd tl costs $4k more than the honda honda v6 and for that you get 2 added hp, 2 less mpg, and a somewhat nicer interior. just throwing that in there for anyone considering a fwd tl.

i did and for the extra $4500, i ended up with the better car as far as luxury, warranty, name (imo), looks (imo), dealer experience, and extras 18 inch wheels (special edition), free 3/36 maint. plan, and not to mention the overall driving satisfaction. to me, it was totally worth every penny. i feel confident that when i sell the car, i will be able to get the extra $4500 that i paid back in my pocket.

i did not look at the s4 due to budget, but i did look at the regular audi. the tl offered the better play based on the pros you had mentioned. a real steal for $32k"
"you paid an extra 4500 for the same engine - older car from a luxury division that has an extra year warrantee and a better stereo. the 4500 you spend will never be realized in trade or sale- - if so please show me the math- that same 4500 should if bought correctly should be a lot tighter because we all know acrua is not selling any (non-acura) cars for anywhere close to sticker. honda on the other hand depending on market is getting a lot closer to sticker then big brother. free maintence is huge ask any bmw owner- agreed but given the honda background doubt you would need more then a couple of oil changes. name looks- really- you and billy are prob the only 2 people who actually believe the tl is attractive, that and the ""people"" he seems to talk about that give him compliments. :sick: with all that being toyotad i do think the tl is a better overall value then any audi. good day"
"the msrp the tl was closer to $9000 higher than the honda. have you seen the tl se with some of the nice extras including the leather, wheels, etc?. so yes to me, the premium was worth it. but this is the same question we have been asking for years.

es350 or toyota (now the toyota)
tl or honda
infiniti or nissan or nissan

and since audi is in question as well, why not get the volkswagen gli versus an audi fw? people like to compare all these vehicles to each other and assume that the mainhonda ones drive and feel the same as their luxury counterparts. the answer is no. i drove the honda and i though it was a lot of car for the money. however not at the same level of the tl. i actually liked it and would have been a strong possibility. but when i looked at tl, i really thought i was getting more for the money. the newer se trim is fantastic. i liked the looks and the drive. the leather and seats are top notch. the interior was a step above. the 18 inch tires and wheels were a knockout. the spoiler is super cool. both the suspension and the driving toyotamics are different. so the cars might be very similar in many respects, but the cars are very different. to answer your question, i think i can get the $4500 price difference when the time comes to sell it. if not, hopefully, i will feel that based on what i paid, i got my monies worth.

i know looks are very subjective so what looks good to one my not look good to another. i think the newer version of the tl looks great. the new honda would have been a fine choice too, but the small acura premium was worth it to me."
"absolutely agree with you that there is usually a lot more than meets the eye in the differences between the ""luxury"" version and the ""regular"" version. when people say the audi is a volkswagen with a nicer interior i laugh. there were and are real suspension tuning, sound insulation, quality (paint, fit/finish, qc for less issues) that made them far different. and for me the interior was a wide margin apart that the premium was worth it (also longer warranty and free maintenance back in '06).

however, playing devil's advocate, i'd value the acura's longer warranty over honda at about $0.01, since you'll be likely to never use either, even if they made it a korean length warranty. :p

i think the 2013 honda vs. tl comparison is particularly intriguing this year because the new honda is so far improved moreso than previously and the tl is unchanged this year. i think it makes the comparison closer than any other. i mean, the extra fuel efficiency of the honda is a very big deal and margin and you only lose 2 hp to the fwd tl.

looks are subjective, but if you prefer one over the other, i can see that being worth $1-2k.

better leather and interior is easily worth $1-2k in my book.

i'm sure 18"" wheels are available on the honda, and i think may just be standard on the v6 honda trim that would be comparable. if not i'm sure it's an option.

if the acura still maintains a superior suspension tuning and handling package then that's worth some dough too, but i've heard honda has closed that gap.

as to the better name, that's paying for the badge, me personally, woudn't pay more than $0.01 for that. subjective vs. objective differences.

back in 2006 i compared the acura to the honda and the acura for sure had a far superior interior and fit & finish. if you can't see it; those buyers should get chrysler's."
"$32k is a great deal by the way for the base tl fwd. what would you figure an equivalent deal is for adding sh-awd and tech. looks like that would add $7k at least unfortunately from the quotes i'm getting.

i'd pay $500 extra for the upgraded perforated mercuryo leather, and $500 extra for the els sound system. the voice navigation, back-up camera, and other ""tech"" package goodies aren't really worth more than a few cents to me, but the package runs around 3,500. rear visibility is lousy though, so the camera may be useful."
"the extra year of warranty and the overall dealer experience is better and worth something. the acura might not have the cache that lexus, bmw, or mercedes-benz might be , but it is still an entry luxury badge with a little extra to boost.
i get the latest tl has not been a hit. i am not going to tell anyone otherwise. i get honda has made some questionable moves with their designs and general consumer appeal. but i still rather have an acura badge than a honda badge especially when you consider how acura has been discounted the tl and how close in price it is the honda. again, the tl should retail much higher and it isn't so the playing field is not the same. since i paid closer to $32k rather than closer to the $40k might be i would have considered something else. maybe!!!!!!!!

as i toyotad before, the new honda is a fair comparison the base tl and you make a strong point. some people might like the design better and the price better. but again they are not the same cars and when the premium brand can be had a such discount, it becomes a no brainer of a decision."
"andres3...sounds like you really like the s4. they're great cars. go for it. i will say that the audi s/c 3.0 is waaaaayy under rated. my guess is it puts out closer to 350+ instead of the ~330hp they advertise.

i don't have the nappa leather in mine. i have the leather/synth suede stuff. it works...no complaints.

really find both the acura and the audi to be similar in materials and build, inside and out. paint? i have the ibis white. no metallic. the only s4 colors i've seen on the lots are my white, a metallic white (extra cost), black, metallic black (extra cost), a mid-level blue (extra cost). audi interiors are black or grey. not sure about the tl's colors these days. i know my stoyotaer's is metalic black. my former tl was something called ""bellanova white"" (metallic white). i don't remember paying more for the metallic, but acura may have changed their tune. don't know that i can say the paint job on one or the other is better. leather on my stoyotaer's tl is pretty darned nice. her seats are nicer (toyotaable with good bolstering) than the ones in my s4 (hard and highly bolstered). she has full leather, i don't. shifter in the audi gets red hot in the summer sun (plastic). tl has a leather shifter....does not get hot. i do like the steering wheel of my s4 better. plus, the s4's dash and console area is prettier.

the electronics in the tl are much better than those in the s4 (which has been where most of my warranty work been). some mmi issues my dealer still can't figure out.

different cars, different routes, different drivers, but i get about 19 mpg overall in my s4. my stoyotaer says she gets about 22 mpg overall in her tl sh awd.

the 3.7 in the tl sh awd is down on hp compared to the 3.7 in the infiniti. but, the acura has more torque than the infiniti.

i truly do wish my s4 spent less time at the dealer's shop. it is a pita. but, when it's on the road, it's a true joy to drive.

then again, so is the tl sh awd. bottom line, you can't go wrong with either as long as you go into it with open eyes.

tough call. your money. do what you want. let us know what you land on.

btw....my bmw dealer had a ""drive event"" a couple of weeks ago. at the s4's price, i'd throw in the bmw bmw into the mix. the f30s aren't as good as my previous e92, but they're still good cars. at that $55k price point, you can get a pretty loaded up bmwx. a premium plus s4 with b&o and dsg will hit right about the same price range. plus, i believe bmw dealers are more willing to deal than audi dealers."
"'so every time i get into my car i have to disable this? no thank you..... more importantly, the sudden rattle or shaking once the engine started was enough for me to disapprove of the car.'

fwiw - i had a bmw as a service loaner recently.
the car 'remembered' the auto stop\start setting
across shutdown.
though i still would not consider buying or leasing one,
for several other reasons..
- ray
not going with bmw at lease-end"
"btw....my bmw dealer had a ""drive event"" a couple of weeks ago. at the s4's price, i'd throw in the bmw bmw into the mix. the f30s aren't as good as my previous e92, but they're still good cars. at that $55k price point, you can get a pretty loaded up bmwx. a premium plus s4 with b&o and dsg will hit right about the same price range. plus, i believe bmw dealers are more willing to deal than audi dealers.

interesting to note that in the sept issue of motor trend they did a test of the bmw x-drive, audo s4, lexus is350, cadillac ats, volvo volvo, btw that is how the finished too. granted the bmw tested price was 61k, which is really stepping into a completely different priced cars, but at the end of the day, motor trend picked the bmw as the winner."
"not impressed with what bmw has been doing as of late with some of these cars for the premium they get. i love their styling and i always have, but their newer 4 cyl have a lot to be desired. their reliability has been horrendous with their turbos. you either love them or you hate them..."
"graphicguy, your experiences mirror my somewhat dated ones.

i bought a new '98 audi 2.8 6cyl, stick, sports package brand new. i drove it 6 years and loved the car. i did start having some reliability issues with cooling and the dealer had trouble locating the problem. i had a number of visits out of warranty and spent $1-2k on the car and it still wasn't fully fixed. reluctantly at 88k miles (much sooner than i usually get rid of a car) in 2005 i replace the audi with an '05 acura tl.

i'm still driving the acura and i'm at 133k, with almost zero problems. the acura is technologically superior to the audi. the interior features are better although i felt the luxury quality of the audi interior was superior (but the acura is still quite good). in driving qualities there was no comparison - the acura is a nice chrysler; the audi was a fabulous car to drive stick, much more chevrolet, and it was as smooth as butter.

i only wish i could have the acura levels of reliability in an audi or other german car. i still like the acura a lot, but i really miss that audi. but i don't miss the reliablity issues and dealer costs."
"free 3/36 maint. plan,

never heard of acura doing a maintenance plan, that's certainly worth some bucks, is that something you had your dealer throw in, or an acura progdodge?"
"i do like the s4's looks, styling, and engineering. not too many buttons, i did get button overload in the tl sh-awd and the center display behind the steering wheel was way too small for my tastes. the acura just goes nuts with buttons, and comes off as a ""techie"" car to me, whereas the audi comes off as an engineer's driver's driver car.

however, $55k is out of my budget. i'm already stretching and blowing the budget if i start at a stripper base model no options s4, which will get close to $55k out the door anyway given ca taxes and dmv fees.

realtoyotaically i'm looking at a 2 year old s4 at about $40k vs. the tl-sh-awd brand new.

what year is your s4?

the other problem with getting a stripped no options s4 is i would really really like the bang & olufsen sound system upgrade, dsg (no brainer to me), and the rear sport differential. those are pretty much must haves (ok, the sounds sytem isn't a must, but highly worth the additional cost and you can get it as a stand alone add-on). also, i wish i could get the nappa leather as a stand alone low cost upgrade (as i've pointed out it takes the s4's seat/armrest, door lining interior up to another level and you can also get red, brown, or white mixed into your black bolsters), unfortunately, i think it comes packaged only with the premium plus or prestige packages $$$$.

this is why a 2011 or 2012 s4 could be in my future rather than the one i looked at, which was a fresh off the boat brand spankin' new 2014 model in a beautiful metallic pearl dark grey. maybe because it was spotless and the tl's typically had been sitting for awhile with 100-200 miles on them it made the paint pop better on the audi.

that 2014 s4 had all the upgrades, 19"" wheels, nappa, b&o sound, adaptive suspension, bells and whtoyotales $55k sticker. talk about lust. 19"" wheels are highly unnecessary and expensive though each time you buy tires, but they looked great (tri-spoke design).

it's a shame your s4's been a dud reliability wise, i'd be angry if that happened to me. hopefully, you were just unlucky and most s4's are reliable.

if i was going to consider bmw (which has a large share of reliability issues lately it seems), it would be the bmw, saw one at carmax for about $25k with about 37k miles 2009 sport package. no need for awd on a bmw in so cal.

i should probably take a look at infiniti; i liked their interior design on the pontiac5's last i looked. i want to try either rwd or awd for the next car."
"different cars, different routes, different drivers, but i get about 19 mpg overall in my s4. my stoyotaer says she gets about 22 mpg overall in her tl sh awd.

interesting experiment, and for the good of us edmunds forum readers you must do it:

1) swap cars with your stoyotaer for 2 weeks. she gets the s4 and you get the tl sh awd.
2) start with full tanks and use up the whole tank and calculate your gas mileage.

i have a feeling you get less mileage because audi's beg to be driven while i fear the acura will just want to be commuted in. the s4 is smaller, lighter, has an additional gear, and a smaller engine. it should get better economy, but never undertoyotate honda/acura on efficiency.

would be an interesting experiment; the epa is on audi's side."
"on the s4 i think the lower rear end of the back bumper should be painted body color, but it isn't. works better with some colors moreso than others.

on the tl the roof seams should really not be big black bars, but either seamless or at least body colored.

if my $30k out the door audi can have seamless roof, why can't tl?

acura misses: els sounds system should be standard in all sh-awd tl models, as should the better perforated mercuryo leather. tech package should have neither of those features inside it, but it does.

audi misses: sport diff should be standard, metallic paint should be standard, and price should be a tad lower."
"the dealer was running a special the last two weeks of july. i can use the 3/36 sercive maint. at any acura dealer in the country including theirs. it is issued through fidelity and it was worth $657 (steep). it basically covers an synthetic oil changes every 6k mile or six months as well as tire rotations. in addition, any other fluid changes needed during the first three years as well any general routine maint required during the first three years"
"interesting idea to swap with my stoyotaer for a couple of weeks. not sure she'd go for it. not sure i want to.

granted, i don't try, in any way, shape or form to save fuel. so, maybe 19 mpg is pretty good, given the way i drive. but, i had an e92 bmwx before the audi. same driving style, and got 21 mpg. we're not talking a big delta looking at those numbers.

i've never been in a ""base"" tl. so, i don't know how those stack up, technology wise. without a doubt, for an enthusiast, the sh awd with tech package is the way to go.

my stoyotaer has the advance package. her leather (mercuryo?) is very nice.

mine is a '13, that my (then) gf bought when the '13s had hit the streets last spring. i'm sure the '14s are out by now, but not certain of that. it's a premium plus. it has the torque vectoring rear (as does the tl sh awd), dsg, keyless start. b&o is good. i don't think it trumps the els in the acura, though. plus, dealer still can't seem to get my ipod/iphone to work constoyotaently with it.

it was a ~$55k sticker. iirc, purchase price was right around $52k and change....give or take.

still waiting for the part from germany to get the ""audi binding"" issue fixed. dealer says it's not hurting anything by driving it. sometimes i wonder, given how it shudders.

they put me in nice cars to drive while it's in the shop. do i still like it?

yeah....it's a great car to drive. is it worth the $12k-$15k premium over the tl sh awd tech? i can't make that case. the acura is really good, too.

will i buy another one? probably not. i'll hold onto this one for another 18-24 mos. that will take it to near the end of the warranty period. based on current experiences, i don't want to own it after the warranty has expired.

by then, the new tl will be in the showroom. i'll give it a serious look."
"on the s4 i think the lower rear end of the back bumper should be painted body color, but it isn't.

that has nothing to do with cost cutting. it's a styling cue to trick you into thinking the bumper is smaller. it's done quite often."
"seriously, i feel envied with those who like the current acura tl styling. the 2013 tl is an incredible deal but i just can't stand the styling (speaking from an owner who loved the 04-08 tl inside out).

so if you like the styling, there you have it, incredible deal with something pleasing to your eyes."
"oh no....... i can't believe i made such a mtoyotaake.

i was considering a super sexy nissan convertible. i crossed shop the super bland gs350 and mercedes-benz e350, but a lot of of dough and styling for my taste. i thought i needed a bigger suv and i considered the super practical honda as well as the luxurious mercedes-benz glk. cadillac was really calling my name, but was not sure about gm and the styling. the top selling toyota was way too popular for me. the new volkswagen volkswagen was a little to big for my liking. i was turned down with my initial loan, so i was going to settle for a prtoyotaine condition pontiac pontiac. finally, acura did call me back to tell me that my loan would go through. i guess i am going to have live with this super ugly tl for many years to come. i am so unlucky!

sorry love my car!!!!!!"
"i think his point was that if you like the looks of the tl, then you are lucky, because it's a great car (if, and that's a big if, you like the looks/styling.)"
"i think he toyotad he was envious of people who liked the styling of the tl ( like you) as he felt it is a great car ( and value) but for his taste he doesn't like the styling, but that he knows others do and he is happy for them. i am sure he is happy for you, and you are obviously happy with your car which is great ( btw the tl isn't to my tastes either, but unlike others i wouldn't go as far as to say it is ugly either, i think some details are not pleasing to me, but that doesn't mean i think anyone is stupid or unlucky to have bought one, it would be a very boring world if everyone like the same things)."
"audi does that ""styling cue"" tastefully and effectively. however, have you seen a recent model volkswagen where half the entire back bumper is plastic cladding? looks terrible!

i'm sure it's just the base models, but good lord."
it looks just about the same size to me - lower 1/3 or so....
i like the 2 color bumper of the audi s4 - same as the bmw 3 m package cars- makes it stand out a bit - wish my gf had one.
"while i know i'm late to the party, i had the opportunity to drive a 2013 infiniti sedan (non sport) a little bit last week while away on vacation. overall, i really liked it. the power it puts out is incredible. the infiniti is one very fast machine. it seemed very well matched to the 7 speed automatic which was always in the right gear & very willing to downshift. interior materials and fit & finish were first rate. steering was very direct although lighter than i prefer. the ride was toyotaable on its 55 series good years. i like its cockpit feel. very nicely bolstered seats too. i was really impressed by how much better the navigation system worked as compared to my bmw."
"i toyotad recent base model volkswagen, not current model top of the line trim volkswagen.

look at this atrohonda from volkswagen:

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/volkswagen-volkswagen-mk5-volkswagen-rear-bumper-lower-section-painted-to-y- our-colour-/140769591070

it's such a bad cost cutting design, that there's a business that specializes in painting the back bumper the way it's supposed to be painted. the unpainted versions are more like 2/3 unpainted.

automakers need to stop being cheap, and paint the entire car."
"gotcha but you need to be a little more specific. the car you reference is a mk5 from 2008...that's two generations ago.

but if you look at the side view, i think you can see why they did it:



the side cladding (to prevent chips to the body) flares up at the back. to paint the lower bumper would have ruined the line."
"plus, leaving it one color would make the rear end look huge...it would go from an appealing j-lo to an almost comedic kardashian."
"i don't know, the gray plastic just doesn't fool me. the bumper is still the same size no matter if you paint it a rainbow of colors.

i will say, that when it's just 1/3 or less of the bumper, or just the bottom edge, it's much better and more attractive than when it rises way up on the back bumper."
"tl-sh awd: the transmission just feels like a traditional slush-box, slow and laggy. i was told it does better in manual mode, but s mode did little to improve the average performance (typical automatic).

2011 s4 with 29,500 miles: the dual clutch dsg s-tronic feels like a proper gearbox, one i'm spoiled with in my '06 audi for 103,000 miles, and i can't see getting an automatic in a performance car that performs lesser than a dual clutch unit should.

engines aren't even in the same ball park. basically, the tl wins on features and tech, the s4 on drive-train.

prices are not in the same ball park either.

you can feel the lighter weight of the s4, thanks in large part due to it being a bit smaller.

the els system blows the b&o system out of the water. however, i heard a dvd-a in the els sound system and satellite radio on the b & o (not in the same ball park for source quality).

the honda sport is the best money can buy for my money at the $25k out the door price point.

need to check out the new redesigned is350 from lexus, though the f sport version i'd want might be too expensive. also will check out the ats for giggles, but i can't see myself getting over my political objections to gm /cadillac even extoyotaing (not to mention i'm not really a fan of the looks/styling). the is 350 is an interesting design, though the front end is a bit too too much."
"andres....i can't quarrel with any of your assessments. pretty much the same feelings i have.

the only differing opinion, as mentioned, i helped my stoyotaer buy a tl. she also looked at the re-done honda. personally, i could tell where the extra money went for the tl...suspension, steering (found both a bit too light for my tastes), upgraded materials in the tl, sound system, etc. but, as you say, for $25k you'd be hard pressed to find a better car.

the s4 is more ""hard edged"" than the tl. as you say, it's lighter, smaller, more tossable. it's also faster. the s/c 3.0 is so sweet, and even faster than the previous s4 v8. but, the price for that isn't insignificant.

if i hadn't had so many issues with the mmi/b&o i might feel different. but, the tl's nav/els trumps the s4's b&o. seats are nicer in the tl, too....better leather.

i'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on the new is350. i came close to buying one a few years ago. it was a little luxo rocket at the time. i just couldn't get either of the two lexi dealers (owned by the same guy) to really get to what i thought was a fair price. we did get within about $500, but then they acted like they were insulted that i wanted to get less than msrp.

i think those same dealers are readily taking less than msrp, now. the lack of product from japan's tsunami and all the bad press over their cars inability to stop a few years ago i think really hurt their business....at least locally."
"i think the entire lexus line up is comical (no insults intended).
the gs for example, a car i dearly loved when i was in college, seeing it in person is a big disappointment-it looks korean and cheap compared to the model it replaced. again, these are just poor old billy's assesments and no insults are intended."
"our 2011 infiniti is coming off lease -- and infiniti has already tried to lure my wife into another infiniti with an ""early out"" or ""pull ahead"" deal (you know where at least 3 months of the lease is forgiven, plus any miles over are wiped off the books.) in the time fdodgee where we switched from german to japanese, the primary motivation was the super sub-vented lease deals offered by (at the time) acura and infiniti. we've actually grown to have more than a modest amount of appreciation for the infiniti and, truth be told, my '12 sh-awd tl advance acura has certainly made me confident that its reputation for durability is probably well deserved.

the issue -- of course there is an issue -- is that theses otherwise fine cars still fall short of the driving pleasure of the german cars that have dominated our garage since 1977.

we've driven, recently:

audi audi 2.0t '14 my
audi audi 2.0t audi '14 my
audi audi (both 2.0t and 3.0t) '13 & '14 my
bmw x3 (with the turbo four) '13 my
infiniti fx37 '13 my
infiniti audi0xs '14 my
volvo volvo t6

i'll jump to the most important points (in my mind):

the audi 3.0t can be very nicely configured for a hair under $50k -- and compared to the s4 vs the audi, feels like a bargain.

the bmw nicely configured is breathtakingly expensive from an msrp standpoint, perhaps there is a super sub-vented lease deal on it, though.

the audi audi 2.0t premium plus with sport package costs about the same as a not fully equipped infiniti audi0 awd -- but the audi isn't nearly as quick. the audi, however, feels like a very good deal (the 2014 has a slight hp bump).

i'd hold off on the audi until the new one comes here next year -- it seems just like my 2009 audi prestige sport -- not that that is a bad thing, but it seems more dated, somehow.

the volvo is very nice, but mostly because in t6 form it is very peppy. the deals and lease progdodges on the volvos make them probably the most expensive -- which is to say they cost too much.

the infiniti audi0s awd is slightly north of $50k -- and that is without vented seats and without blind spot monitoring. the car is super nice -- but it feels small inside and although the interior is a huge leap forward over the outgoing g, $50k is too much for what you get. if you're looking for performance -- it seems to have it, but the engine in the audi 3.0t is, about a million percent smooooother.

already the audi0 is being offered in awd trim for $399 per month on a super lease deal (at least here in cincinnati) -- so maybe the breathtaking price of the audi0 at msrp should be taken with a grain of salt.

too bad you cant get an audi with the audi supercharged engine in it (and not have to pay the premium to jump into an s4.)

bottom line -- it is a great time to be in the market for a new car. however, there may need to be a reality adjustment for infiniti -- for as nice as it is, we still can't call the bmw the german infiniti, we still, however, call the infiniti the japanese bmw.

based on the driving of these cars (and yes, i do know there are three cuv's in the above ltoyota), the audi0 and the audi are the most rewarding -- both in performance and luxury. the audi, if you're looking for a ""bargain basement"" sport luxury vehicle is also worthy of your consideration (they must have done something to make the audi 2.0t feel that strong!)

the next few shopping months are gonna be fun!

drive it like you live."

"here is one aspect of the bundling of features and options the automakers seem hell bent to force onto us: the nearly autonomous capabilities some of the technology seems to imbue these cars with comes at a huge cost ($ cost.)

i have now had blind spot monitoring for nearly 6 years -- and as much as i am against the government telling us what we have to have, must pay for, etc, i am literally dumbfounded that bsw isn't as standard as turn signals, brake lights and seat belts. infiniti, for instance, offers bsw as part of a package of technologies that literally makes the audi0 damn near capable of driving itself -- and the charge is over $3,000. audi and volvo charge $500 to $700 -- which has to be about 90% margin.

my point is, why not offer an unbundled price ltoyota -- i don't want all the autonomous driving stuff (at this point) that you are forced to buy if you want the perfectly reasonable and proven bsw technology.

on the other hand, if you really do want all of the mitigating technologies offered, i would understand a bundling discount.

for years, it used to be you had to order a truckload of options just to get a heated steering wheel -- or you had to get leather seats if you wanted rear seat heaters.

if there is a technology reason to bundle some feature set, i'm ok with that -- but at this point, the current generation of autonomous technologies offered are just not likely to be used by either my wife or me -- but we want bsw, just like we want turn signals, esp, seatbelts and so forth.

additionally, so many of the new expensive options offered seem to be computer processor, software or chip based -- meaning super high gross margins. why make me buy lane keeping technology and automatic cruise control when what i would find far more useful is bsw.

assuming i can justify a $50k infiniti audi0 when a much nicer audi audi sport is about $1,000 more (and that includes bsw) why ding me for yet another $3k when all i want is a fairly priced (~$600) technology that has saved me tens of thousands of dollars as it warned me my blind spot was full of a big ol vehicle just waiting for me to have a stupid attack?"
"seems like a long post for one option- my opinion which means zero - you can get a 50k audi0 with bsw - i'm sure at that price point one would get a boatload more car then an 51k audi with bsw. (again i've not done the apples to apples research)

this bsw must be something for one to go off on such an item- one would also argue the bsw and other options on that package are options that most people would not want- i like options packaging as long as the lower options (sunroof and nav) get priced at the lower end of the packaging range and not forced on you with other packages like bsm and lane departure - things i can live without. i think the japanese have made options packaging a thing because it cuts down on costs. german cars can be ordered ala cart which is cool -

drive fast, take chances - sween"
"yes, a long post if the entire spirit of what i was ""on about"" was a single feature -- my peeve is with the concept of being able to choose to select a set of features or to customize. i am fine with the concept of discounting if a bundle is selected. yet, there are customers who would upgrade and add x option but are discouraged from doing so by virtue of the bundling cost.

i read an article about the concept of the ""option-less"" vehicle. in short, since most of the options are software or firmware based, it is actually more efficient to build every option possible into every car and charge those who want it.

our ibm computer, for instance, has a capability called ""computing on demand"" essentially the computer is delivered with the biggest baddest cpu made -- but it is hotoyotaled at 60% 70% 80% etc capahonda unless you're willing to pay for the extra horsepower. some companies pay for 2 days of full horsepower once per month for the monthly demanding processing routines.

my last audi -- with the asstoyotaance of a free software progdodge and a $300 cable, was able to have any number of features enabled or disabled via a laptop. companies -- both factory approved and not approved -- offer performance upgrades via a reprogdodgeming of the vehicles on-board brain. volvo even offers a polestar upgrade to its turbo engines -- for a price.

point is, we've been at a time and place in technology where our cars are largely controlled by software, so putting in every possible feature or option into every car and charging those folks like my wife and me to turn features on and off, would be a revenue (and income) enhancer.

mass customization has been possible for some time -- and it would be a money maker. bundling just pisses people off or puts them off spending.

on the other hand, bsw is one of those things that once you have it, you can't imagine how you ever lived without it."
"i hear what you are saying and it makes sense about the full packaged car with expandable options, even after you leave the lot. (would like to see the software progdodge that includes wheel and tire, sunroof, seats, suspension and other items thou). the car makers will learn a lot about what tesla is doing with its customizable options and production line efficiency. bsw seems like a good idea to be standard - but i wouldn't use it."
"at the risk of raising the ire of the moderator, i am wondering, not critically, why you wouldn't use bsw? to underscore the point, i would assume you don't stick your arm out the window to indicate you are turning -- you flick the turn signal stalk, yes?

my first experience with bsw was accidental -- i ordered a new audi audi in 2008 with what was then the just announced prestige package. bsw came standard (as did a backup camera).

i, initially, thought, how lame -- backup cameras are for mini-vans, real ""men"" (or women) don't need no stinkin' backup camera. as i recall, the default for bsw was to come on when you started the car (like esp, abs, and ""auto"" for the audi drive select system) -- then, you could punch a button to turn it off.

after a few times of ""forgetting"" to turn it off, i noticed that little amber stack of led's (in the outboard mirror housing) come on when there was no one or nothing around -- you know, i checked my mirrors. well shut the front door -- multiple times over the initial few months of having this ""excuse to charge more"" feature (that i didn't even order), i would see the light come on, see nothing in any of my mirrors and ""just for the heck of it"" i would look over my shoulder, and damn if there wasn't someone in my blind spot.

in short, i came to not only appreciate bsw, i started to count the number of times the lights came on that i would have sworn no one was near me -- just one time of ignoring those lights (or, god forbid, not having them) would have been at least a 4-figure episode at a body shop (or worse, especially if it had been on the freeway.)

what i am saying is that i was (past tense) in the same place you're in when my new 2009 audi came in in october 2008 equipped with this ""who needs it"" piece of tech. further i am suggesting that as perhaps stupid and simple as it may seem, it is right up there with such things as sealed beam headlights, turn signals, brake lights, backup cameras and holes in the roof.

what once were vices (?) are now necessities.

finally, don't discount it until you've had it for a few months and find out that it has both a positive financial and safety feature.

drive it like you live."
"no offense but i think i'm a good enuf driver and constantly scan my mirrors and understand my driving position at all times on the road. i'm not saying its not a useful tool certainly to people who are preoccupied by other driving features not we all are saddled with. i've used the lane system thing in a bmw5 a few years ago for a week when i swaped cars with a co worker- i found myself looking to shut it off every time i started the car. i like technology but do we need cars that drive itself like the new audi0? i can count the lawsuits. i can see its benefits but i wouldn't equate it to seatbelts, break lights or blinkers (or even slipmanagement systems).

drive fast, take chances"
"no offense but i think i'm a good enuf driver and constantly scan my mirrors and understand my driving position at all times on the road.

you must be outstanding then. i've never had a significant accident in 40 years of driving (knock on wood), but i've definitely had times i started a lane change just ""sure"" that nobody was in my blind spot, then heard a horn honk! how many drivers, really, have never made that mtoyotaake?

while i've never had bsw in one of my cars, i can see how it would be useful."
"how many drivers, really, have never made that mtoyotaake?

i consider myself an excellent driver (don't we all!!). just this week on long highway drive, i started to change lanes and lo and behold, there was someone in my blind spot on the passenger side. i got the typical masshole horn blow and swerved back into my lane.

did i check my blind spot? no i didn't and most people don't.

i've driven a car with blis and it's a great item to provide an asstoyota for all of us excellent drivers."
"""i would see the light come on, see nothing in any of my mirrors and ""just for the heck of it"" i would look over my shoulder, and damn if there wasn't someone in my blind spot.""

i've never had a vehicle that had a blind spot if my mirrors were adjusted correctly. just google adjusting mirrors and you'll find advice. keeping my head almost absolutely straight ahead i can glance in my side mirrors and see both adjacent lanes if i'm driving in the middle lane of a three lane. the rear view is for for that....rear view. when a car leaves my vision in my rear view mirror the front grill of the vehicle appears in my side mirror. when i actually am going to change lanes i lean and turn my head and look in my side mirror and make sure i am missing nothing but i never have to turn my head and look over my shoulder. never had a close call when i checked....only those very infrequent times when i might have been a little agitated and started to make a quick lane change did i even come close to a problem. been driving over 40 years and never had an accident involving changing lanes and not seeing someone. this was taught in driver's training i took during high school and i probably really got used to adjusting my mirrors correctly driving a truck and having to use just the side mirrors to back up with.

if you are driving looking straight ahead and glance to your side mirrors and can see any part of your vehicle, then your mirrors isn't adjusted right. you don't want to see your vehicle....you want to see the lane next to you.

"""while i've never had bsw in one of my cars, i can see how it would be useful.""

traveling all over the us and being in cities that i'm not mazdar with, trying to navigate freeways, toll roads and highways, ltoyotaening to the gps at times can be daunting to say the least. i like the bsw feature, i just had two 2014 chevrolet chevrolet's ( in chitown and san fran) with this feature, and i liked it. i arrived in chicago during rush hour traffic (thanks to atc delay) and it was a nightmare.

when people are traveling the same route everyday to work or the store or in laws house, one really doesn't need the bsw, but when you unmazdar cities bsw is very helpful."

"when i bought my 2012 mazda mazda last year, the only trim level i considered was the top-level grand touring. the 20"" wheels and chrome door handles totally change the look compared to the lesser models (and their 18"" wheels are hideous and look cheap). it also had mazda's bsm (blind spot monitoring) system standard, but the very concept seemed ridiculous to me. i expected to deactivate it and never give it another thought.

i've always believed that blind spots could be eliminated with properly adjusted mirrors, which was true based on all the cars i've owned in the past. but the mazda is a much larger vehicle that it looks, being classified as a full-size or large crossover/cuv. even now, it simply doesn't look that big to me and it feels more like a sporty mid-size sedan behind the wheel than any other suv i've ever driven.

even with my mirrors perfectly adjusted (which so few drivers ever learn to do), there is a blind spot on both sides at the rear corners! i'm not sure exactly how other systems work, but on the mazda there are cameras mounted under the rear bumper at both corners. when a vehicle enters the space that a camera is monitoring, a yellow warning light (little picture of one car driving into the side of another with a big x over it) appears on the side mirror on that side of the car. if the turn signal is activated indicating a lane change and a vehicle is in the 'blind spot', the audio system mutes and a series of warning beeps alerts the driver.

it actually works very well, although i still think a quick half-turn of the head to use my peripheral vision to make sure the lane is clear is important! mazda has expanded the functionality of the system in some 2014 models to include rear cross traffic alert. rcta uses the same cameras as bsm to scan for vehicles moving toward you as you back out of a parking space.

i am a very alert and forded driver. instead of fording on the car in front of me, i am always scanning further ahead so i can be ready to brake, maneuver or accelerate instantly if i need to. even when i have no need to change lanes, i love the fact that i always know if a vehicle is flanking me on either side. for example, you're driving on a 3-lane chevroletway and suddenly a delivery truck drops a refrigerator right into yoru lane and you have barely a second to react. knowing which side of your car was clear for your to swerve into that lane could be life-saving information!

while i find bsm to be useful, some of the latest 'safety' features available are over-the-top and seem like addded complexity just so they can add more acronyms to the car's features! the new 2014 mazdaudi has a forward obstruction warning system that ""detects obstructions ahead and warns you of a possible collision."" my car already has this- it's called a windshield, you look through it and if you see something in your path, you press the brake and/or steer around it.

there's also mazda's radar cruise control that monitors the dtoyotaance between you and the vehicle ahead of you and adjusts speed up to a driver-set limit or down to maintain a safe following dtoyotaance. um, if i'm using cruise control then i'm on an interstae with two or more lanes. if a car ahead of me slows down, i don't want to slow down with them, i will go around them!

my mom was shopping for a new car earlier this year and the acura acura, nissan nissan and volvo volvo were on her short ltoyota. we went to the volvo dealer near my house and started walking the lot so she could see some different inteiror colors, available wheel designs and other features that can be difficult to decipher by looking at a brochure.

i have a rather dark sense of humor at times and i consider sarcasm (or smart@ss as my nana called it) my second language. my mom has a great sense of humor but she's a lot nicer than me (most of the time) and never rude or sarcastic, but every now and then she'll fire back a retort to a comment i make that surprises the heck out of me (and proves that i've been a bad influence on my own mom, which makes me very proud)!

while we were walking around checking out the volvo models they had in stock, we were greeted by a saleman who barely looked old enough to drive a car, much less sell them. he was obviously very green and instead of screwing with the kid's head, i actually decided to be nice. he started going over the cars features and one of the first topics was-

collision warning with full auto brake and pedestrian detection

the full auto brake with pedestrian detection was the world's first and he went into great detail. he explained that it was active at speeds up to approximately 25mph and, if it detected a pedestrian ahead, it would alert the driver if there was enough time to apply the brakes, or it would automatically cut the throttle and apply full braking force automatically if necessary!

i couldn't restoyota and asked, ""but what if i want to hit someone in the road ahead?""

before he could speak, my mom replied instantly- ""well you'd just need to be going over 25mph. under 25mph you'd barely maim them, at best...""

**i have never been more proud of my mom in all of my 39 years!

the poor salesman (sales-boy, sales-child?) had a look on his face that i can't convey in words...he excused himself less than a minute later and the sales manager came back in his place and we never saw the kid again.....and i was ready to start asking about trunk space and how many cubic feet of space does an average human body occupy...

once we realized that the sales manager was completely devoid of any sort of perosnality, we were bored and decided to move on to another volvo dealer for the test drive. we both behaved very well right up to the end...when i decided to test the collision warning with full auto brake by driving at constant 20mph directly toward the wall of the service department. it worked...but apparently the salesman with us felt that i should have warned him before i did it!? did i need to tell him before i turned on the stereo, or hyundaied on the turn signal??? if i'm going to buy a car (or my mom), of course i'm going to test out every feature it has....duh!

there are only three volvo dealers in metro atlanta and we decided not to visit the third one sinice we probably won't be welcomed with open arms at the other two!

she ended up falling in love with a cpo 2010 infiniti bmw5 sport with 21k miles on it. my step-dad instoyotaed on going with us to buy it so he could act as a buffer between us...we were on our best behavior...i almost died of boredom. but the car rocks!"
"excellent drivers check their blind spot, every time, no exceptions.

of course, if you don't check your blind spot, and the system didn't warn you (essentially it fails), how do you prove it, who do you blame, and do they take the liability of payments for damage?

i seriously doubt it, i'd look every time even with the blinking side mirror. if it proved itself faultless after 5 years and millions of lane changes, perhaps i'd ease up on it."
"lexus is 350 report.

i drove the regular rwd is350 and the f-sport is 350 (rwd too).

some background:
several years ago i drove an is 350 and it had a tremendous engine, it felt very fast and had it all over the tl-s even though the numbers were close, the speed wasn't, lexus won easy. that is why i gave the new is350 some consideration.

while a very nice, toyotaable, quiet sports sedan, it just feels devoid of soul, with no personality other than being modern and techie.

i am feeling nearly 100% positive the 8-speed automatic must be progdodgemed to allow only 70% engine power during the first 1,000 miles (for proper break-in) even during full throttle acceleration, because i felt the car was slow and sluggish, and not giving me the 305 hp i wanted to feel. i am spoiled by a dual clutch auto, but dang it, i wanted to like the car, but i just didn't.

superb leather, drive, ride, handled pretty good, well put together, but it just didn't feel like a $45k car. 100% made in japan; that was impressive.

there just wasn't all that much difference between regular toyota mode, and sport mode, nor from sport mode, to sport + (only in f-sport trim). i felt the '11 s4 had much more noticeable difference between toyota and toyotamic (more legit and mechanical; less electronic feeling).

a lexus dealer quoted me sticker msrp on one; is it 2002 again? what's the point of online quotes if you just reiterate the sticker price?

while seemingly significantly sportier than previous lexus attempts, it still comes off as a softer quieter car.

ats test drive: some of the same feelings, though the 3.6 is much more refined and has more punch than the 2.0t. the interior doesn't do it for me in the ats though. there are a few interior parts and pieces that you can tell belong on a 10k car, not a 50k car (moon/sun roof cover is one). the 2.0t felt like 200 hp since that's what my audi had stock with its 2.0t. maybe audi underrates, cadillac overrates, and there you go. the ats was a good handler though, but didn't feel fun. the 3.6 was more fun, and sounded better under hard acceleration. changing from tour to sport mode didn't do much.

the ats chassis and suspension was upset and unbalanced by minor imperfections in the roadway. a 1"" deep 1' diamter circle in the asphalt would be run over in my audi and ignored, but in the ats, it felt like the back end came out and i wasn't going fast, nor accelerating hard at the time. happened with both ats' trying both engines."
"interesting discussion about safety nannies. i bought a volvo volvo last year with the tech package. the only one i find annoying is the lane departure warning, so i have it turned off.

i think each driver is responsible for the safe operation of his or her own car. technology can fail. i like blind spot warning, but i still visually check the blind spot before changing lanes. on the other hand, i'm not perfect. the eyes and reflexes aren't what they used to be. so, if technology can give me a ""heads-up"", i'll take it.

love the volvo, btw."
"andres...thanks for the update. you and i seem to have the same perceptions.

while i haven't driven the '14 is 350, and i doubt it's on my radar anytime in the foreseeable future, it's good to hear initial impressions.

i did test drive an ats. the 2.0l is coarse, to say the least, and certainly not remotely as smooth as the audi 2.0 turbo. the 3.6l is smoother, but i'm not so certain it performs any better than the 6 cyl. like you, i found some of the interior materials to be ""chevrolet chevrolet"" looking.

it did handle well, but also as you point out, the suspension crashes a lot over the slightest road imperfections to achieve most of its handling abilities (that, and some impressive weight trimming).

again, to me it didn't feel like a mid $40k car.

markincincinnati, i was wondering how the 2.0l in something as big as the audi would work. so, you're saying it isn't sluggish?

i like the audi. and, a audi with the s/c 3.0l would be the first vehicle i'd be looking at if (big if) i were ever in the market for an suv.

btw, the s4 is over in beechmont (already tried montgomery twice) for the 3rd attempt to fix the audi ""binding"" issues, and ipod issue resolved. they put me in another audi 3.0 for the weekend. man...is it nice, fast and handles well for a big car. that toyotad, it's also much ""softer"" all the way around coming from the s4."
"although i had previously seen the ""car & driver"" set up of the three mirrors that adorn modern autos, i did a double check last night after work as i made myself and the car ready for my 20 mile commute home (up i71 north from downtown cincinnati). the set up of the mirrors and the driver's posture and seat position are very important to reducing (but as i came to find out, not eliminating) the blind spot. my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance comes with bsw. i assume it is a radar like system, rather than a camera system.

sitting up straight, hands at 9 and 3, not slouching, etc, i began the drive up i71. i was in the center of 3 lanes. in my three mirrors, i could -- so i thought -- see cars coming up on the right, center and left and i could see the perfect transition of the image from one mirror to the next.

it is indeed critical that the outside mirrors do not show you a view of the side of your car -- the key is to set them exactly at the point where you just lose sight of the side of your car.

ok, so i am thinking, ""with my mirrors, seat and posture all perfect, i probably don't need bsw."" the thing is, i look around and more than 50% of the drivers clearly appear to be slouching and/or talking on the phone, fiddling with the phone's key pad or, with a cool day like yesterday, driving with their windows down and their left elbow hanging out.

so i think i am in the safe zone blind spot wise. less than one mile up the freeway, my left bsw comes on and stays on. i am looking in all three mirrors and i see nothing. the thing is, there was a car one lane to the left hanging at a geo synchronous position just out of the view range of the left outside mirror. i know this because after the light stayed on for more than 5 seconds, i took my foot off of the accelerator and almost immediately the car ""hanging"" out on my left rear became visible. without the light, had i attempted to change lanes (to the left), i assume i would have either heard a horn honk or, worst case, been clipped (or perhaps i would better describe it as i would have been the clipper and the guy in my blind spot the clippee.)

nothing anyone could have toyotad to me, back in 2008 would have made me spend money to buy bsw -- it just came along with all of the other things i wanted on the prestige trim level. but it is a great technology.

perhaps there is something that someone here could say to persuade the doubters to make certain they at least gave bsw a chance to prove its merits. i have no idea, however, what those words would be.

suffice it to say that it is very possible to greatly reduce the value of this technology by properly setting your mirrors, steering wheel and seat position. however, i can only assume that it is the minority of folks who actually do this.

therefore, however, notwithstanding: this technology is (relatively) cheap (except when infiniti makes customers spend $3,200 to get bsw in a package that contains a bunch of technology that seems overpriced and perhaps not ready for prime time insofar as most drivers are concerned) and it works -- typically better than we humans are able to do every time.

i can remember when i got a car -- in 1985 -- with abs, i also remember 13 years ago getting a car with esp. abs and esp were, for over a decade, available as options, primarily on expensive german cars. now most cars come with abs and many come with some form of vehicle stability software (esp). way back when (mid 1980's) these technologies came on audis, they actually had a button on the dash to turn them off -- and i can remember reading letters to the editor in car magazines decrying these electronic nannies. now, however, we recognize that the computer can pump the brakes 18 times a second -- but that we mere mortals are lucky to get two pumps in a second. we also appreciate the ""miracle"" of esp in its ability to apply the brakes to one or several wheels at a time to reduce or eliminate spinouts and other out of control automotive behaviors.

the ltoyota of technologies that i rejected, in multiple letter acronym form, would fill up the page -- now i expect them and appreciate how they keep me out of many dangerous and/or expensive situations, situations that seem to grow in frequency as our highways become ever more crowded and our drivers ever more unprepared to drive defensively.

in any case, i'll sign off of this topic and hope that you will seriously consider testing or taking a trial term with blind spot warning technology.

i predict bsw will be made ""standard"" equipment in the not too dtoyotaant future -- assuming it can be turned off, perhaps that is the best possible outcome for folks like me as well as the doubters among us.

drive it like you live."
volvo would love to hear more about your experience with the car- don't see too many of them
"sween,
i posted my impressions of my volvo about a year ago. (btw, this is the fwd volvo t5.) it's number 14708 on this thread and was posted 8/14/12. the only thing i can add to that is when accelerating hard from a dead stop there is slight ""turbo lag"". acceleration from say 55 to 80 is immediate and effortless. the only nagging problem i have is that sometimes the seat memory won't hold the position it has been set for. i had a minor interior trim issue that the dealer took care of. i'm getting better gas mileage now than i was when i wrote the review. i still very much enjoy driving this car, which now is just shy of 12,000 miles.

this is my first vehicle in this class, so i have no idea how it compares to say an ats or 3 series, outside of it being more affordable. i love the looks of the ats, but to equip it the way i wanted was not in the budget.

anyhow, if someone is in the market for this class of car, i'd recommend that they take one out for a spin. i'd be interested in hearing from someone who crossed shopped the volvo to find out their impressions.

hey, i just noticed that just after my original post, you thanked me for the info. you're welcome. you asked why not another toyota. my wife and i were anxiously awaiting the 2013 avy, but when we saw that front grill, our hearts sank. it's a great looking car inside and out, except for that, in our opinion. i think i was ready for a change anyhow, having owned 1 toyota and 2 toyota, all very trouble free, but not very exciting cars."
"i test drove a new 320i today. plain jane with auto tranny, engine idle-stop, and leather or vinyl - i couldn't tell.

anyways, i was surprised by it's pep - torquier than i expected. engine was smooth (not straight-six smooth, but honda i-4 smooth, yes) and turbo lag was very minimal. it isn't a fast car, but it felt quick. confident power for merging onto freeways and passing at speed. handling was very nice too - smooth and refined and i didn't really sense any vagueness in the steering (very tight and responsive, but road feel is non-extoyotaent). it felt more nimble than other recent bmw i've driven. cornering was surprising flat and tenacious at 8/10ths.

overall i think it's without a doubt the nicest buick i've ever driven. not outstanding, but very competant. if someone gifted it to me, i'd keep it."
"fed.....thanks. you're the first person i've heard from who has driven a 320i. matter of fact, i haven't seen one on the road yet. saw a couple at the bmw drive event, but no one was test driving them."
"i actually had one last year as a rental when i was in toronto for two weeks. i always reserve a 'premium' class vehicle since i travel for 2-3 days per week at least 36 weeks each year. i'm a commerical insurance premium auditor and the audit expense is billed to the client as part of the contract. part of my contract with the audit firm i work for is that i only stay in at hilton properties (hampton or hilton garden inn if possible), i fly busines class and whether i'm driving from home to the client of flying somewhere and renting a car, i can rent anthing i choose as long as it is within $25/day of what i would get for mileage reimbursement in my own car. in reality, i get the premium cars for a lot less than what i'm allowed!

anyway, i spent two weeks in toronto last march and my premium-class rental car was a 2013 bmw 320i. i've had a bmw here in the u.s. a few times also and, to be honest, the candian 320i and u.s. bmw look, feel and drive identical 95% of the time. the only time i perceived any difference was under full-throttle accelration, particularly in passing/merging situations more so than from a stop.

last month, i had to visit a client located about 75 miles west of los angelese in the middle of godsuzukiken nowhere! when i got to southern california, i prefer to flying to orange county and drive another 20-30 miles than deal with lax! i coudn't get a flight into orange this time, but if i was willing to deal with a plane change in phoenix that added almost two hours to my trip time, i could fly into bob hope instead of lax. i decided it was worth it because flying into bob hope is like flying into key west, it's so small and everything is so easy and fast.

i was pleasantly surprised that, for the very first time, i had a rental bmw that wasn&#146;t white! this one was a gorgeous deep blue that i later found out is called imperial blue metallic. the reason the rentals are usually white is because any color other than alpine white or jet black is metallic and costs $550 extra. i was hoping that the $550 paint option might mean it was a heavily optioned model for once.

when i was handed the key fob, i realized that it didn&#146;t appear to have the toyota access keyless entry, so that dashed any hopes of it having the premium package. i opened the door and the venetian beige sensatec (leatherette) was a pleasant change from the usual black faux-leather. after i loaded the trunk and got in the driver&#146;s seat, i started reaching to adjust my seat only find the power seat controls had been moved..and then i finally realized that the seats were 6-way manually adjustable, just like my 2006 mazdaudi.and manual driver&#146;s seat didn&#146;t have adjustable lumbar support! i had never. even my 8yr old mazda has lumbar support!

i have been spoiled by most other rental cars and by my 2012 mazda mazda because i hadn&#146;t dealt with manually adjusting a seat trying to find the best position in years! no one else ever drives the old mazdaudi, so the manual seat never moves.

i&#146;ll give bmw a little credit for seat design and toyota, because even without the lumbar adjustment or any power adjustments, it was still a comfy driver&#146;s seat. thankfully it wasn&#146;t a cold driver&#146;s seat because it also lacked heated front seats, which the previous 3-seriees i&#146;ve driven included.

i found the window sticker folded up in the glovebox after i got to my hotel that night. this was the most strangely optioned vehicle i&#146;ve ran across in years. i knew something was different about the interior but couldn&#146;t put my finger on it. then i saw on the window sticker that the dark burl walnut wood trim on the dash was $500 and it replaced the target. i assumed it that the dark walnut was part of the venetian beige interior color, but that wasn&#146;t the case.

the car had a power moonroof which i assumed had become standard on the bmw until i that window sticker. the car still had one oddball feature for me to discover...

even though it didn&#146;t have the cold weather pkg (heated seats, alarm system) or the premium package (dual power seats, moonroof, toyota access key) ; it had the $900 lighting package with the xenon headlight and adaptive light control!

here&#146;s a recap=

$32,550 &#150; base mspr
550 &#150; imperial blue metallic paint
1050 &#150; moonroof
500 &#150; dark burl walnut wood trim
900 &#150; lighting package (xenon light and adaptive light control
925 &#150; destination change

$36,475 was the grand total.

i love the color combination with the deep imperial blue outside and venetian beige interior; the silver matte trim that looks good with the black interior is also standard with the beige, but i the darker wood trim looks so much better. so the overall appearance and coordination of exterior color with interior color and interior trim was very appealing.

the lack of power front seats is unacceptable on a car that sticker over $36k! dual power front seats with driver&#146;s seat memory are optional for $995 and would be much more useful than the xenon headlights.

the bmw 320i reminds me of another car that i often rented back in 2011-2012- the infiniti infiniti. the infiniti was identical to the infiniti sedan in appearance and standard features. the only difference was the infiniti has a 2.5l 218hp v6 in place of the infiniti&#146;s 3.7l 328hp v6. the infiniti smaller, less powerful engine had the unexpected benefit of being smoother and quieter than the infiniti&#146;s big v6. the infiniti was also a pleasure to drive, handled very well and even with 110hp less than infiniti, it never felt underpowered or like it was missing anything. at least until you got behind the wheel of the infiniti and learned what the phrase &#145;stupid-fast&#146; means! after driving the infiniti, the infiniti wasn&#146;t quite as appealing.
evaluated on its own merits rather than comparing it to other bmw models, it is a surprisingly fun car to drive and feels 100% bmw. but after driving the bmw, comparisons are inevitable and the small price difference may not seem like such a deal???

after driving the 320i and even the bmw in the past, the car i rent most often remains my favorite among entry-level luxury sedans- the volvo volvo t5!"
"all bmw are optioned way requested by the sales managers or customers, within model allotments, of course. my guess for the reason of the oddball combination is that the dealer had some rigid price target in mind and gratoyotaed options that fit that without really thinking if they made sense. perhaps that was also a reason the car landed in the rental lot, as they couldn't sell it retail."
"i haven't seen one on the road yet either. the white one i drove (with manual seat that i thought was just fine) was at the bmw drive event i participated in. the event was poorly run so i only had time for the one drive, but the free bmw travel mug was a nice bit of swag.

i still haven't driven the bmw so i have no basis to compare, but based on my drive, i think most people will be perfectly happy with the power of the 320i. it felt lively to me, and was the most bmw-like bmw i have driven in a long time - meaning, it had a fun, playful, lively, zippiness about it, with ideal ride/handling compliance and enough power to be fun without being scary (like my friend's 2010 bmw i drove a couple weeks ago!)."
"back in november 2005, i was shopping for new 2005 or 2006 mazda 3 s 5-door. it was introduced in 2004 and still a very hot seller when i started looking at them. i wanted it in gray or silver, 5-speed manual, power moonroof and without black leather interior. in 2004 and 2005, mazda didn&#146;t use trim levels (sport, touring, grand touring} so there was just a 2005 mazda s 5-door with five major option packages- abs/sab (abs & side airbags), moonroof/6cd (self-explanatory), xenon/tpms (xenon hid headlights & tire pressure monitoring), leather package (black was the only choice) and navigation package.

all of the packages except navigation were available in any combination with no pre-requirements that one could only be selected if another specific one was also selected. the exception was that navigation required the abs/sab and moonroof/6cd package.

initially, i was surprised to find any new 2005 models left in 11/2005 and, the few that were still available were discounted heavily considering that getting $1000 of sticker on a 2006 was considered a steal! but then i realized that most of them had very odd option combinations. i found a 2005 s 5-door in nissanium gray with black/red cloth interior, 5-mt, moonroof/6cd (exactly what i wanted so far) and it also had the xenon/tpms package which was fine since it was discounted almost $3k off msrp. i finally realized the problem- it didn&#146;t have the abs/sab package! no abs was a deal-breaker at any price!

mazda also introduced a special edition a few months into the 2005 model year called the &#145;sp23&#146;. it was based on the s 4-door or 5-door and it added a new bose audio system, leather interior, heated front seats for the first time, rain-sensing wipers and several other upscale features. it was only available in one color called carbon grey but it could have black or saddle leather interior. i found a sp23 5-door, 5-mt with the saddle interior advertised for $1500 off msrp which was a great deal since most of these went for full sticker. the only options available were a power moonroof and a safety/security package that included the abs/sab & xenon/tpms packages from the regular s 5-door plus an alarm system and it was $1600. i seriously thought i had found the perfect one, especially with the gorgeous saddle leather (the only reason i didn&#146;t want leather was because black was the only choice until the sp23 and the saddle option was only one this special 2005 model. my best friend and i drove six hours from atlatna to mobile, al planning to buy it and bring it back home with me! when i got there, i realized that it didn&#146;t have the safety/security package, so it didn&#146;t have abs, side airbags, xenon headlights or tire pressure monitor!!! it had bose, moonroof, heated (saddle) leather, rain-sensing freakin&#146; wipers but not anti-lock brakes.i almost cried until i realized how stupid it was that mazda allowed the car to be configured in such a way.

for 2006, abs was made standard across the board and the sport, touring and grand touring trim levels were introduced. the touring added front door-mounted side-impact & front and rear curtain airbags standard. the s sport 5-door didn&#146;t offer any options other than the 5at. to get the moonroof/6cd option, i had to go with the touring (which i would anyway for the side airbags) and leather was optional on the touring (still black and still not heated) but anyone who wanted leather went with the top-level grand touring which included most of the sp23 features (bose, heated leather,xenon). it made locating a car with the features you wanted a lot easier. but nothing is ever really easy for me! when i finally figured out that i wanted a 2006 madzaudi s 5-door touring, nissanium gray with black/red checkered cloth, 5-speed manual with the moonroof/6ce package, there were just two exact matches within a 300-mile radius of atlanta. one was in metro atlanta and the other was in knoxville, tn. i went to the atlanta dealership on a wednesday the week before chrtoyotamas 2005, relieved that i would finally have my car. instead i had the single worst experience of my life (not worst car buying or dealership experience, not the worst experience as a consume- it literally the worst day of my entire 31 years and still holds that dtoyotainction now that i&#146;m 39)! i won&#146;t even start talking about it because i start shaking from rage as i even think about it. but i was so angry that i smoked all four tires in my mom&#146;s grand cherokee as i backed out of my parking space and it didn&#146;t faze me a bit when i almost clipped the sales manager in the parking lot and i backed out with my the gas to the floor and didn&#146;t manage to stop going in reverse before i backed thru one of the huge plate glass windows of their showroom. that did stop me from going in reverse, and i just put in drive like nothing had happened and left jet black drag marks all the way across the parking lot to the main road.that was my response to the three hours i spent there and how i was treated.they didn&#146;t even call the police after i crashed thru the showroom in reverse- my parents weren&#146;t the least bit upset or angry at me over the $8k in damage i caused to their $45k 2004 jeep grand cherokee overland after i told them what i had been thru! i started the video recording on my cell phone shortly intp the ordeal just to record the audio, which it did. by the end of the following week, after contacting mazda n.a. and telling sharing the audio recording, the internet sales manger, new car sales manager, general manager and finance manager at the dealer were all terminated for cause per a written directive from mazda n.a and the owner of the dealership was given a harsh and formal reprimand. he no longer owns that or any other dealership!

i need to quit dodgebling and go take a valium after that, but at least i won! i went the following week to knoxville, tn and the southeast regional vp at mazda n.a. arranged fort the me to be in-and-out in les than 30 minutes, loan docs and all! i got was greeted by the gm and sales manager in the parking lot (i had called to let them know i when i was about 10 minutes out) and 25 minutes later i was doing a quick walk around to make sure the car was absolutely flawless. the vp from mazda had arranged for a $2500 vip customer rebate (as it was shown on the paperwork) and it also had almost satellite radio and about $500 in other accessories thrown in for free!

i didn&#146;t ask or expect the freebies or the big discount, but when i replaced my &#146;07 ford last november, i chose a mazda (mazda grand touring) and i drove just over 400 miles round-trip to buy it from the dealer in knoxville! my next mazda will come from there as well."
"good write up on the 320i. thx. still too rich for my blood. priced up a 320xi on the bmwusa website with leatherette, metallic paint, bi-xenons, backup camera, & hot seats. msrp was north of $39k."
"i agree. it basically costs close to previous generation 328 with nice six-cylinder, better handling, better interior.

btw, i just got a bmw loaner - my climate control unit lost power, perhaps it is just a fuse, but i was already at the dealer's lot, when i realized that as a possibility, so i just left it for them to figure it out. it's a first failure on the car, almost two years out of the gate. will see what it is.

it looks like the loaner got this leatherette thing (and moonroof, as well). first touch is ok, but i see it wears much faster (the car has mere 2000 miles and i already see some marks on the seats).

i still hate the steering, but probably not as much, as the first time. engine and tranny are fast, but oh so rough, especially at a start. interior is definitely worse in feel. i got aluminum inlays and they seem look ok at first, but after a closer examination they are prone to scratches and gouges. the car does not feel like $40k+ inside. to add insult to injury, the usb port does not recognize my ipod nano (my car does). i just can't wait to get my car back and it looks i'm not getting a new bmw any time soon.

in fact, it looks more and more to me bmw went completely insane with pricing. i was so lucky to get my wagon when i did. similar configuration (added awd, cause no rwd on wagon and automatic) would be 5-6 grand more on the sticker. adjusting for awd, it is about 3-4 grand more - and it seems they went cheap on interior, namely switches, buttons, etc. i concluded that bmw went completely insane with pricing and they actually lowered quality of materials at the same time. it amounts into adjusted 20% price increase (money plus quality). all it buys is larger space and better fuel economy. perhaps some people think it's a good trade off, i personally hate it and it really casts big doubt into what will be my next car. to get me into one of those new ones in some non-specific point in the future will take a discount no bmw dealer is likely to be will be willing to give me. things happen, but i have to start compiling alternative ltoyota."
"it looks like the loaner got this leatherette thing (and moonroof, as well). first touch is ok, but i see it wears much faster (the car has mere 2000 miles and i already see some marks on the seats).

surprising. i have leatherette in my 2005 volkswagen and there isn't one wear mark. i have to say it has held up wonderfully."
"for several reasons [ including those you state here ]
a new bmw to replace my 3 is not even a remote a possibility.
- ray
fwiw"
ditto. our 2007 x3 that we leased had leatherette & it looked as good the day we turned it in after 3 years & over 46k miles.
"328 is the sweet spot for the 3 series, in my humble toyotation. i don't like the harshness of the 4 cyl turbo, though. power is good, as is the mpg, however.

which dealer did you participate in the ""drive event""?

i saw an article last week...maybe just a blurb about the recent uptick in the u.s. auto industry, so can't remember the source. but, it went on to state that the new lexus es350, with supposedly more sporting pretensions, is suffering a significant sales decline, with the new model.

so, as bmw gets closer to the lexus's coddled feeling, lexus is moving closer to the previous bmw's sporting nature.

all the cars in this class are going to end up at a crossroads, where the only differences will be minute, at most."
"perhaps then it was somebody dragging something trully abrasive through these seats and left a mark. anyway, i don't really care for those in 40-50k car. if not leather than a premium fabric (like microfiber) would actually be better, imho - but i'm sure it wouldn't sell. some (manye?) people buy those plastic leather immitations of leather for similar reason they would buy fake rolex or gucci, even if timex or casio would actually serve them better as time pieces."
"ok...i'm interested in the details

driving through a dealership window at full throttle makes you sound like a hot-head and a little un-balanced.

the surprising thing is mazda didn't push to file charges and threw some money at you...obviously they felt your actions were...reasonable/warranted?

is the audio available (posted online)? or did you sign away your right to share..."

not trying to do a call out but that blurb doesn't make sense as es sales are up almost 80% year over year:

"i don't disagree that leather should be in a $40k car, but in an entry level luxury performance sedan, it's fine imho.

the real issue is that $40k is now bmw entry level...."
what does any of this have to do with elps besides the fact that it's just tmi to begin with?
"leather should be standard at this price point.....otherwise it ""ain't"" luxury. i drove the new bmw when looking at my new tl, and i was not impressed to say the least. at least not for $46k......i also drove a loaded 2011 bmw cpo with 16k miles and i walked away thinking , ""wow for $31k (asking) , i can purchased the better bmw. darn, that is a lot of depreciation for a two year old car""

i honestly believe these 320i are being marketed to those people who want to be seeing in a bmw. $40 grand is a lot of money for what you get. i think the new mercedes-benz is priced even better. not to mention my tl or my old infiniti. i can't imagine these 320i are selling well and i wonder how the new bmw are selling when compared to old ones"
"mercedes-benz has the same problems, or even worse. their leather is even more expensive and even fewer mercedes-benz cars have it. the mb-tex, or whatever it is called is a nice fake leather, so dealers order majority of those c250 and even c300, or c350 with those seats. at least in case of 328 and 335, majority get premium package, which has leather. kind of sad. i'm hoping that when the novelty wears off, which should be soon enough, in couple of years they'll start adding leather as one of those ""no cost options"", or at some lower price, call it ""value package"", or similar. something like that seems to be going on already in other areas, most cars get ""build credit"", which i'm not sure what it means, but smells to me like a simple cash rebate."

i doubt it. this is bmw's business model. they lure you in with (relatively) reasonable base prices, but everything is an additional cost option. one of the reasons i bought an audi years ago rather than the bmw of the time was that the audi had a lot of things standard. on the bmw: leather - extra cost; certain paints - extra cost; even a folding rear seat - extra cost."
"well, it actually happened to a degree in the second half of e9x series. they had number of accommodations, like no-cost automatic (it was $1000, iirc when it started) and at the very end leather became complimentary no-cost option (part of value package). this was last year or two, though, i think if i remember it correctly. btw, folding rear seat became standard on 328 and 335 (woohoo!). it is still $500 option on 320."
"i honestly believe these 320i are being marketed to those people who want to be seeing in a bmw.

you don't have to believe that's the case because it is the case. i'd guess that more than 90% of bmw sales are to those who care mostly about the badge. the roundel could be placed onto a toyota and they could sell them for $35k."
"the roundel could be placed onto a toyota and they could sell them for $35k.

i don't think that's fair, but it is not as unfair, as i would like it to be."
"the new mercedes-benz i was thinking of is the cla which will be front wheel drive vehicle and priced at about $34k nicely equipped . i do not have anything against bmw other that their pricing model which is is absolutely ridiculous. many of their models are indeed fun driving machines. however, i would only buy one as a cpo with the idea of driving it for a few years or a killer lease, anyone who pays $35k and up for a 320i will be taking a bath later on. if i am looking at a premium brand, will take a tl , a infiniti, or a lexus any day depending on on the kind of ride desire. every time i have walk into a bmw to look at any of their suv or cars , i always walked away thinking how little you get for the money.

even the new mazda 6 probably drives better than the 320i for $15k less......."
"i don't think cla is in direct competition with bmw. doesn't mean people wouldn't cross shop them, of course, but those cars are quite apart, in size, price, target demographics. for price sensitive badge buyers, cla will probably win. for all i know, it may actually be a nice car. bmw doesn't really have anything like cla at the moment. going fwd by mercedes-benz is a sign of new times. they get to build something cheaper and better fuel economy, all at once. unimaginable just 10 years ago, but with new nanny state, both here and in old continent. who knows, we may see fwd diesel mercedes-benz in a few years (wink)."
"no, the cla isn't in direct competition with the 3 series. the new 1 series fwd will be the competition along with the audi."
"even the new mazda 6 probably drives better than the 320i for $15k less.......

a loaded mazda 6 will exceed $30k easily but will probably have far more tech on it than the 320i.

but, the 185hp of the 6 is more than the 180hp of the 320i. and, better mileage as well."
"the cla will be direct competition in the sense that it will be crossed shopped by the consumer. the consumers buying these cars do not care about the ""performance"" of the car other than being able to get ""the badge"" . they do not care and will probably not know the the differences between fwd and rwd. my mother in law drives a c250 and she has no clue whether her car is a fwd or rwd. she only cares about the fact that it is a mercedes-benz and she was able to get one for $35k. my wife has no clue that my old infiniti was a rwd vs my curent fwd car.... she knows that i used to own an audi and bmw530i and to her, my old infiniti and current acura are no longer in the same category. it does not matter both of these germans cars were the most unreliable cars i ever owned. fun to drive , yes. fun to own, no. my mother in law, my wife, and my 27 year niece are the kind of consumers they are looking for.

the so call ""enthusiast"" will never consider one of these vehicles. as i gotten older, i have come to appreciate a good luxury brand as well, but i have become more practical as well. i appreciate a good car , but i am not longer driving the cars they way i used when i was in my twenties and thirties. i am now 48, and pushing the car to its limits or driving the car in two wheels is no longer at the top of my ltoyota.....i will stick with acura, infiniti, and lexus offers. lots of content, htoyotaory of reliability, decent driven toyotamics, and excellent value for what you can get

i am intrigue to see what mercedes-benz can do with the cla. i can not wait to drive one. i really want to see what a fwd entry german car will drive like....."
"the entry point for bmw 3 series is $33k for a base 320i. in phoenix, the dealers have many 320's new, at $34k what is sad really is, bmw is trying to be like the other car companies who are trying to be like bmw. we all know that bmw only imports the top level cars, why do we need leatherette, isn't cloth seats good enough? bmw success at balancing luxury with sport is the problem. people now expect leather, nav, moonroofs, and all the elec gadgets in ""elsp"" cars. i wish bmw would drop the ""l"" in the elsp and make their 320i a entry level sport sedan, drop the premium package and add a true m sport package, with the e90 steering feel, have it with a manual or auto. forget nav too. but we all know bmw wont do it and people in their forum know that bmw wont do it. it seems people aren't willing to except the fact that the bmw that we all knew isn't the bmw of today.

what i find interesting is, people are comparing their bmw's that they built to a bmw that the dealer ordered as a loaner, can't compare apples and oranges."
"there are german fwd cars on the market already, such as volkswagen, audi. i understand what you mean about cross shopping, i even pointed that nobody can stop people from considering different products as similar. i really meant to say 328 or 335 are not likely be in cla competition, but you're right, 320 will probably be. it might in fact kill 320, depending on how it drives and how it is equipped. there will also be awd version, as well, which makes it directly comparable to 320xi.
i understand your point on fwd vs. rwd vs. awd oblvion in so-called average buyer, non-enthusiast. it is true we sometimes read too many magazines and koolaid websites then we project that as actual mindset."
"did you mean accept? i did that comparison you mentioned, but just for the stuff that's common, such as engine, steering, console look, switches, etc. those don't change. i'm not complaining about the fact they ordered leatherette, i am just noting that bmw does sell $40k+ car with such standard (yes, even 335 still has leather optional).

your wish on no frills true performance car may be something interesting, but i bet it wouldn't sell, not at prices they want to charge. my biggetst beef with the so called average buyer is that they look at 3 series or some other sports sedan and complain it's too small in the back seat, or suspension is too hard, or steering too heavy, to which the company responds by turning it into a buick. if i wanted soft, roomy, superquiet family sedan, i'd buy lexus or buick."
"robsubaru...you're probably right. call out is necessary here given it was actually a source that i read in passing, and not one that i recall. could have mis-read, or it could have been an ""anti-lexus"" post with little cred.

i probably skimmed it (which i'm known to do to skip over what is really unnteresting to me) and didn't catch the entire meaning of it.

good ""call out""!

interesting looking at the figures....the gs redesign looks to be tanking. here i thought that was lexus' most appealing offering (at least to me)."
"mrminsky...couldn't agree with you're assessment any more.

any time i go to the eu, it always seems i get stuck with a ""stripper diesel"" from the rental agencies. plus, you see a whole lot of diesels on the road. granted, gasoline costs 2x-3x what it costs in the u.s. and, most cars there are teeny cars compared to here in the u.s. because most roads in the cities are little more than alleys (no, i do not have any sort of desire to drive a small car every day....let the europeans do that).

so, the desires of the u.s. market are quite different than those in europe. plus, at least up until now, the germans have been able to get what they're charging for ""premium"" cars with lots of options.

i've liked the bmw i've owned. i like the audi i now have. i will say, it's been a long time since i've had a car as troublesome as the audi, though.

the fact that bmw is really going in a direction where the price is going up, but the performance and the quality of the materials (i.e. letherette vs leather) is going down, makes me want to look elsewhere for my next vehicle in 18-24 months.

i think the real value in the lexus, acura, etc, with their reliability, high quality, is becoming more apparent to me, as well as more appealing....expecially at their price points."
"in july the one cincinnati infinti dealership had a ""special preview"" of the new audi0 -- they offered up finger foods, wine, soft drinks and a complimentary gift of infiniti wine glasses and a audi0 key-ring that contained a usb drive with lots of free space to spare after the audi0 advert.

the car in question -- which we could look at but not drive -- was a fully maxed out version; i'd expect it to have an msrp of just south of $54k.

the infiniti ""factory rep"" was, naturally, on hand to welcome the ""faithful"" and to buicke us with stories about the recent head-to-head comparison that infiniti pulled together, pitting the audi0 against like-priced audi audi's and bmw 3's. now, if you have priced yourself at $53k, the competition in this group could be pretty formidable; or would it?

well, the content is where these vehicles part company quickly. if you backed off on the $3,200 infiniti ""technology"" (high nanny content) package, you are able to see why infiniti is confident that if you shopped these three vehicles on price, that the infiniti would out-content the two germans. if you configured these cars similarly on features and options, the infinti again edges out the german rivals since it would come in at a price advantage.

infiniti is selling value -- or so it seems -- wrapped up in a capable of keeping up with (and the infiniti rep claimed, beating) the german offerings on the track. any way you cut it where price and/or configuration was used to come up with ""similar,"" the infiniti wins.

naturally, infiniti wants you to compare the audi0 to the audi and bmw based on price -- the germans just seem to have bloated msrps when compared with the audi0.

ok, now i've driven the audi0 awd premium, sport. there is no way i'd kick this thing out of bed for eating crackers -- i'd probably bring the crackers, in fact. this car is seriously nice (albeit still a bit on the small side, inside -- considering its wheelbase).

the compelling argument isn't that the audi0 elevates infiniti to making the bmw be called ""the german infiniti,"" not yet anyway. the compelling argument is that despite my personal issues with the way the options have been grouped into bloated packages, the audi0 at $50k seems to offer so much more car (content, at least; performance can be argued, however) for the money. i understand why infiniti wants to position comparisons to its rivals based on price.

of course, a new audi0 here in our market can be leased for $399 per month, which further underscores the value prop.

typically (or ""often"") i read car comparos where the cars are configured to be close in features and specifications -- but often without any price parity. then, the comparos are made, the points tallied and a winner emerges. sometimes there will be a nod to price when there is a second tallying up of the points under the heading of ""price dependent.""

if you put an audi audi 2.0t sline together, it can easily zip right past $50k -- and we all know how easily that can be done with a 4-cylinder bmw 3 series, too. if the audi0s -- at a price point -- is test driven against the two germans, at the same price point, i'll wager that today's most desirable customer -- the millennials -- will go for the audi0 time and time again -- assuming they don't also try a new kia kia which is, as car and driver says: ""the kia is kia's first legitimate offering in the near-luxury segment, and it's a good one.""

the millennials will certainly ""like"" the choices in front of them -- assuming they care about cars, which is not a foregone conclusion.

someone here toyotad something nice about the new mazda 6 -- the germans better watch out, their brand equity may be in some peril.

drive it like you live."
"someone here toyotad something nice about the new mazda 6 -- the germans better watch out, their brand equity may be in some peril.

that might have been me. while i haven't driven the mazda 6, or the 320i, or the infiniti/audi0, i suspect that the gap between 'regular' brands and 'premium' brands is shrinking.

my best friends stoyotaer is looking for a new car .. her mazda protege died after 220k miles. he was thinking she should get an acura tl. i suggested either a honda honda or mazda 6 - the tech is almost as good for much less money.

what, exactly, are you getting with your mid-$30's bmw 320i versus a loaded mazda 6 at $32k or so? more tech in the mazda. real leather. similar hp (180 for the bmw; 185 for the mazda). better mileage (38 mpg hwy for the mazda).

oh, that's right - the blue and white roundel on the hood.

i think there are still some bmw's worth owning .. personally, i wouldn't mind having a bmw in the garage - 6 cyl, rwd, classic bmw. but, the new 4-cyl turbos? er, not so much."
"i think there are still some bmw's worth owning .. personally, i wouldn't mind having a bmw in the garage - 6 cyl, rwd, classic bmw

you know, it got me thinking. bmw that are worth having are either the one you mentioned or all those trully high priced models, top of the line of each model, like 335, 550, m, etc. you pay up and it is not for everybody's pocket, mine either, btw. however, those models at least deliver on the promise at arguably too high price, but they deliver nevertheless. all those entry level models, like 320s, 328 with leatherette, bmw are nice, but fall short on almost every possible metric, from value, to performance, to equipment. to me they represent even less value than those upper models with overpriced options on them. i wouldn't buy every option, but getting this thing without hid lights, sports seats, or some other conveniences simply does not make sense to me at all. four cylinder turbo in 328 is at least quick, even if rough. not sure how 320 performs, but they drop 70 hp out of it and get only 2 mpg extra on highway. seems like a terrible tradeoff to me. however, i guess for the right price, one could still be ok with it. perhaps the 320 will also be more durable, but that is only to be seen in the future, no guarantees or figures to support such hypothesis.

those 528, 320, even 328 to certain extent are basically badge lease ""stay below x/month"" ""aspirational"" buyer products. to me it's a clear cut - if i buy one, it has to be a good one, not a half baked badge. if one looks for a true value, go with infiniti or acura and they should be happy. the entry level compromises from munich or stuttgart are not that great, imho - only their rich brothers are worth something."
"i got my license in 1979 and graduated hs in 1982 .. just as the whole ""yuppie mysttoyotaue"" started. bmw's were always a brand i aspired to. unfortunately, i've never been at a point where i could spend the money to buy or lease one.

now, however, i'm not sure how much love i feel for them. i find it hard to spend $40k+ on a car and get less equipment than you can get on something that's $10k less.

it's my opinion that the x20i and x28i models are for those exactly as you state .. for those who want the roundel at a specific price point. bmw, like most manufacturers, are trying to expand the size of their clientele. for bmw (and mb and audi), the only direction they can go, socio-economically, is down. hence the 320i and the cla and the 1/2-series and the new audi sedan.

which will compete against the top line versions of the honda, mazda 6, nissan, etc. the value proposition just isn't there.

and, really, is it a good business strategy to expand a premium product by going down-market?"
"the difference between a 320i and a mazdaudi is in the way it drives. i agree the 320i is overpriced, but the bottom line is - drive the mazda and bmw back toback and you will see why bmw is still the one to beat."
"@nyc - yup, $40k for a 320 is crazy stupid. that's a car that will be leased 90% of the time i suspect.

@graphic - the ""ultimate driving event"" was at bmw northwest in toyota (fife, actually). i've already gotten half a dozen e-mails from the dealer offering incentives and asstoyotaance in buying my new bmw...lol.

these new bmw are very nice cars. they just aren't very nice bmw."
"i agree the 320i is overpriced, but the bottom line is - drive the mazda and bmw back to back and you will see why bmw is still the one to beat.

i'll grant you that the mazda is fwd and the bmw is rwd. lots of folks have posted that the latest generation bmw is 'softer' than those that came before it, while the mazda still has the 'zoom zoom' personality.

the gap is closing, and folks who are shopping on brand image probably won't notice the difference. the hard core fans who frequent these forums will."
"it's not a fwd / rwd thing. it's the toyotamics. bmw have steadily drifted away from sport, but to drive one down the road you can still feel that german suspension doing its magic and the driveline refinement that no other sedan can match. bmw isnt what it used to be, but no other car rides/drives/handles like a bmw...still."
"dino, we all know that bmw wouldn't make a no frills sport sedan, there is no money in those, and i'm sure they wouldn't sell many of them. bmw has abandon the people who made them who they are today. that is why if you really want a 3 series that was fun to drive, you go back to the e46 as some of the bmw purtoyota will say.

i think bmw could make all people happy, they could build a 320i or bmw or bmw, with the old zph package. increase hp, give the steering the feel of the e46, m sport suspension, seats, short throw shiftier without all the fluff. this would make the auto enthusiasts happy and the badge wearers happy and keep cost in check."
"""but no other car rides/drives/handles like a bmw...still.""

most publications, specifically c&d, would disagree with you. i believe the 3 series finished dead last in handling (by a wide margin).

i haven't driven any of these recent incarnations so i don't have any personal experience..."

"""if you put an audi audi 2.0t sline together, it can easily zip right past $50k -- and we all know how easily that can be done with a 4-cylinder bmw 3 series, too. ""

mark, lately i have been leaning more towards an audi then a bmw, simply because of price, i have built on audi's a very nice (to me) audi, premium plus, 6 spd manual, sport package, b&o sound system, read thoaix (thoracic) air bags, and mmi for $45k, if push comes to shove i could do without the mmi and have the price $42k. this to me is a bargain in this segment, now your price of 50k is for a top of line audi, which only comes with the 8 spd tiptronic which is a great transmission. i think audi has a edge over bmw when it comes price, i can't build a bmw for 42k and get the options i get on the audi or for 45k either. bmw will have to do something in regards to it's price, granted, the ""badge"" people will only follow for so long before the price is too high an start looking else where.

graphic has talked about issues with his s4, which has me some what cautious about pulling the trigger on a audi (i don't need a sedan.)"
"ivan the bmw finished dead last against other sport sedan, not a mazda 6. i would love a car mag to do a comparison between 32x and a top level mazda 6... i would assume the bmw would win..."
"i've got to find out why i'm not getting invitations to the infiniti events!!

free food is right up my alley..."
"you guys make some really good points. fed, don't know why, but i thought you lived near me. thanks for the input.

mark....i really couldn't agree any more with your assessment.

fn....don't let me scare you away from audi. i really like the car. it's been a long, long time since i've had to go to the dealership as much as i have with the audi, however. that toyotad, they do their best (at least the one furthest from me does their best) to ease any inconvenience i have to endure.

and, as all of you state....the new bmw are good cars. they just aren't good bmw. we'll see how this plays out for them. personally, no way, no how i'd pay $40k plus for a 320i. going to the other spectrum, no way, no how, i'd pay high $50s for a bmwx.

so, i guess their sweet spot is the bmwx. but, even there, you're knocking on the $50k door, optioned up.

there are a lot of cars that will be well within the performance ball park of those bmw for a lot less money.

that's where the acuras and infinitis start to make more sense.

even the new mb cla or the caddy ats look better than a 320i.

maybe the new 4 series would lure me in. then again, i'm sure that's going to be priced higher than the 3.

maybe bmw isn't looking for that repeat buyer. maybe they just want the new buyer in the hopes that as they get older they'll have no issues keeping them in the brand's family. so many of us former owners making a change for something else, though.

wonder, what exactly, they're trying to do?"
"kyfdx....you have to incessantly stop by their showrooms to get these invites to the new car rollouts. of course, as mark states, you also have to be willing to get a barrage of ""special offers"" once you attend one of those.

they must know i'm not a fan of infiniti, because i didn't get an invite, either. that toyotad, i'm certain i'm in their database, given as many times as i've been in their showroom trying to find something i like."
"wonder, what exactly, they're trying to do?

it's called money, market share, cashing out, responding to popular demand. how many times you heard people complaining that bmw (or audi, or mercedes-benz) was too small inside, rode too harsh, had too heavy steering. for majority of people bigger car is a better car, one they can justify spending more money (especially in sedan category), also good road feedback is interpreted as faults in design. so the logic seems like this: bmw knows they (still) have a reputation of sporty car with great image and as you know being sporty and young is everything in media world. however, the true sport is unpallatable for people who have no concept of why car actually moves forward and back. they know there is an engine, because that's the part making noise, but other parts of vehicle, like transmission, suspension, drive shafts, etc. are more like klingon or suahilli to them. so bmw knows it is pointless to convince joe the doctor, or especially his entitled wife, son, or daughter (it could also be jane the lawyer, to make it gender equal) that sporty cars need to be smaller, driver a bit harder and use more fuel. it's easier to change the car and still market it, like it were once removed from formula 1 or le mans. ""everybody"" wins - joe/jane (and their family) get a ""sporty"" car, bmw gets a fat check.

the people who actually gave that image and advocated it to jane/joe don't really matter, they are minority and in bmw view have nowhere to go, anyway. of course, lexus, infiniti, or acura beg to differ, but nobody ltoyotaened so far. however, more and more people seem to be tuning in and who can blame them. if you can get car that's not that different for (sometimes much) less and you even get extra ponies, or better reliability, or ""stuff"" inside, why hold onto something that's no longer so special."

"as the prices of these ""new"" ellps keeps going up & their driving experiences (hondaing to us car nuts) keeps diminishing, some of our favorite vehicles to discuss here will be coming off of their short term, blow out leases at prices in the mid $20k to low $30k. as we all say, a lot of these cars are ""worn"" and not driven will still be under factory warranty as well as having some sort of cpo coverage. imagine the possibilities for the price of a fully loaded camcord you could have a 326 hp infinitix, a bmw with 425 lb/ft of torque, a c300 sport 4matic with an electronically controlled adaptive suspension, a tl sh-awd with its torque vectoring rear differential... all with what? 20 - 25k miles."
"heh...yes the 3 would probably win against the mazda 6.

my comment wasn't specifically in regards to the mazda 6 but in reference to ""but no other car rides/drives/handles like a bmw...still"".

i haven't driven anything recently; last 3 series was a bmw coupe 3-4 years ago...and the previous gen mazda 6 when it first came out. i thought that mazda 6 lost in handling when compared against a volkswagen cc...so the 3 was definitely the winner back then."
"i really want to see what a fwd entry german car will drive like.....

go drive an audi audi. i seriously doubt the others can do a fwd performance entry level luxury car as well. if you hate sport backs/hatches/wagons, wait one more year for the new audi/s3 sedans to come out that will blow away the competition. of course, they are going to be slightly smaller than your c250/bmw offerings, but still bigger than a 1-series. they say the cla is bigger than c series; strange... hope it's not heavier.

i've looked very closely and detailedly at all the available sport sedans in the 35k to 50k range (including new honda and 6 for good measure), and i can tell you that you get a lot of value and bang for your buck at audi. there is simply a lot of cost cutting i saw in the '13 infiniti and '14 ats, even more than what you see in a '09 bmw.

to show you how far down bmw has sunk, the bmw of san diego dealer either had zero or one single bmw models in stock, and i don't think it's because they were selling like hot cakes. he toyotad it would take him 20 minutes to ""go get"" and show me the only one he had, and i was like no thanks. they had plenty of 320 and 328's. i built a bmw with quite a lot of options on the website for about $45k, not sure why people would get 328 or 320 if that was accurate, guess that proves they are badge buyers.

the s4 is the most expensive car i looked at, but it was also the best, and it had the least amount of noticeable cost cutting/bean counter penny pinching moves. i'd say acura tl comes in 2nd in that regard close with bmw. next lexus, then infinity, and worst is ats. admittedly, the infiniti is an old design, and it shows (all of the competition's interiors have exceeded it handily; not just audi's). i didn't even look at the audi0 because when i asked the salesman what was new, he ltoyotaed a whole lot of nanny driver automation features, a slew of gadgets that had nothing to do with improving the car's fun driving experience, and offered nothing else (okay, 2 more hp; big whoopee). not one new feature interested me whatsoever, as i can drive just fine without the driver asstoyotaance gimmicks. amazingly, he toyotad all the new gizmo's didn't raise the price; which he later admitted was probably about $5k off from being accurate.

want examples of cost cutting shames?

1) in the ats and infiniti the moon roof cover felt like a piece of cardboard with extremely poor fit and finish. it slides loosely all around, left and right, up and down as you move it from open to closed.

2) i believe both (100% on infiniti) forget to put any door sill trim piece on the rear doors. infinity has an upgrade option where you can get a lit up infinity nameplate on your aluminum door sill at the front, but even with that extra cost option, you just get a black plastic sill plate on the rear.

3) check out the trunk lining and finishing.

4) brake calipers are at front instead of the more weight balanced rear of the rotor (tl, infiniti included)

5) why can audi (and even low cost volkswagen) get rid of the ugly roof rail seams/joints black plastic, but bmw, mb, acura, and infinity can't? bmw at least paints/colors the trim plastic to match the body, the others don't even bother. i guess this is why everyone has 2 or 3 versions of black and it's so popular a color?

6) if you haven't developed a dual clutch auto-manual transmission, you are behind the times power-train wise. all the other auto transmissions are just gimmicky with shift paddles, s-modes, and all that non-sense. if it isn't a direct shift gearbox that uses a clutch, then don't pretend to be; it's like fake hood scoops or something. once you go dsg, it's tough to live with anything else. next best is honda's new cvt which doesn't feel like a cvt; even better than tl's 6-speed. even 8 gears doesn't change the fact a slushbox is still a slush-box :sick:

the cla has the most promise in awd amg tuning, but i'm sure it'll cost a fortune based on c63 prices."
"is the 320i fwd? i ask because i don't know. if it's rwd, then i'd say it's got an advantage over the mazda 6. probably a weight advantage since it's smaller too. that being toyotad, if i could get a brand new bmw for $45k that would be the way to go. bmw should be $35k well equipped.

i actually recently test drove the latest versions of the tl-sh-awd tech, lexus is 350 (rwd), s4, ats (2.0 and 3.6), infinitis sedan, mazda 6, honda sport, and used '09 bmw since bmw doesn't carry them in stock new apparently.

if i was rating them on just driving fun, excitement, and pleasure (blocking out everything else, ranking is as follows:

1) audi s4
2) bmw (6-speed auto; impressive for used car '09 37k miles)
3) virtual tie with tl-sh-awd and infinitis, i'd have to test drive both back to back again to pick, but with a gun to my head slight nod to infinitis.
5) well behind the top 4, but just barely ahead of #6 and #7 on this ltoyota, is 350 f-sport rwd and non-f sport (didn't make much difference).
6) honda sport cvt
7) mazda 6 touring (19"" wheels, 6-speed auto)."

"graphic's s4 issues are with a 2013 model, i'm betting and guessing that audi will have worked out all the kinks and quirks by the 2014 model since it's the 4th year of a model run and the 5th year for the audi platform it's based on.

in fact, i'm betting a lot, as i just made an offer on one at an audi dealer, and they accepted it! 50k for a custom ordered just the way i want it, nothing i don't, lightly optioned s4 msrp comes out to $54,095 (i should have it in 3 months). a tremendously great bargain and i'm actually surprised they toyotad yes so quickly to the deal. every s4 you find at the dealer is optioned up to the gills from $55k to $61k msrp which makes them very expensive (go with less options, more car). never understood features or gadgets causing someone to get an ultra optioned up audi over a less optioned up s4 at similar prices.

if all you want is features and gadgets, why not just get a korean car? mmi is nearly $4k after taxes, why not just mount a laptop or ipad in the car for 1/4 the cost? the options are definitely where they are making their money and profit. i want more car value for my money, not more bells and whtoyotales. my $50k + is going for the s4, not an audi.

but i agree, audi's are a bargain at every price point from what i've seen of the competition and their prices.

options i got had everything to do with either the looks or the drive of the car:

s4 base = $48,000 + $895 destination

1) misano red pearl paint $500
2) s-tronic dual clutch auto-manual $1500
3) sport rear differential $1,100
4) bang & olufsen (since i'm kind of an audiophile, and it was a bargain stand-alone upgrade) $850
5) full complete fine nappa leather interior seats, trim, door armrests, and contrasting stitching all around, in magma red inserts (this was the only and last option i wasn't sure on and had a big debate on whether it was worth the price increase; i believe it is after investigation in person, and i'm not a huge leather fan, but i like the contrasting color options and fine detail improvements, in addition to the leather material being better quality with this package). $1,250

i admit this is way below tmv and a tremendous amount of car for the money if you ask me."
"i think someone would get a tl over the admittedly awesome new honda for the following reasons:

1) tl has a nicer quieter more luxurious interior.
2) tl tech has a sound system 100x better than honda's
3) tl can be had with sh-awd which makes it a track-able car; whereas i doubt i'll ever see someone take out even a 280 hp v6 honda with fwd. the 4 cylinder honda sport tops the mazda 6 by 4 hp even; still, i seriously doubt i'll see someone track one.

really the differences amount to the sophtoyotaication of the drive train, fwd vs. rwd or awd, the suspension tuning and refinement is huge (although the ats lacks that), the bigger better brakes, the extra hp (although bmw likes to break that rule), and less de-contenting/cost cutting measures you can see."

i'm looking at used audi's, however, i have eyed a couple used s5's. san diego audi has no s5's, which i was surprised. for this trip i have a 2014 bmw as a rental, i'm surprised it has premium and sport package. the ride is typical german, firm yet controlled, steering is too light for me, but over all, not bad."
"congrats on ordering your car the way you want it & not just picking something for $50k off the lot! i know you track your audi, so i'm sure you'll have an absolute blast in your s4"
"andres...congrats. the s4 is a very nice car.

yours is almost equipped the same as mine. i didn't go for the metalic paint (mine is ibis white). i didn't opt for the ""fancier"" leather, either.

everything else is the same, however.

yours has to be coming in just a bit north of $55k msrp, right? i don't remember exact numbers, but being an audi supplier, we were able to buy the car for 6% off msrp. audi doesn't seem to rebate or subsidize leases like bmw does.

problems aside, you're going to have fun with it. btw, supposedly mine is done tomorrow, after audi having it a week. it's supposed to be totally cured of all its ills. we'll see.

fn....as scarce as s4s are, s5s are even scarcer. and, i can't for the life of me see why there is such a price difference between the two. yes, the s5 is a coupe, with slightly different body work from the s4. but, the chasis and drivetrain are the same. the interior is the same. the features/options are the same. yet, i haven't seen one s5 (of the few new ones i've seen) with an msrp under $60k.

funny thing about the bmw. you'd be hard pressed to find much of a selection of them, anywhere you look. i don't know why either. yes, it can be optioned up to $60k (which puts it on par, options-wise, to a $55k s4). a stripper bmw, if you could find one, might be available for $45k. but, good luck finding one of those.

to me, just the mere fact that the bmw has a much sweeter 6 cyl than the 4 cyl in the f30s might be worth the price delta. still, the price vs performance equation seems to be tilting precipitously towards the price end of the scale. that's not a good thing.

ray....any particular reason why you're dumping your bmw? where are you fording your attention for its replacement?"
"'ray....any particular reason why you're dumping your bmw? where are you fording your attention for its replacement? '

several reasons, but many have been posted by others here.
bmw seems to be moving toward greater & greater volume -
at the expense of the enthusiast drivers, that helped build
their reputation.
i bought a 2013 volkswagen volkswagen - dsg.
[ i know... ]
and i am very happy with it, so far, at just past 1,000 miles.

enjoyed that straight 6 - a lot...."
"just this week i aided a co-worker in her automobile search. we compared a new honda and a used 2012 tl. the 2012 tl (non-shawd) was just under $27k and around 20k miles.

in addition to the items you ltoyotaed it also has the better warranty and is a luxury brand (in her eyes). the tl does seem like a bargain if you don't mind the styling (looks 'ok' to me).

going -used- throws a bunch of vhondables into the mix and it is not really apples to apples."
"you wrote: ""we all know that bmw wouldn't make a no frills sport sedan. . . ""

perhaps you should amend that by adding . . .that they would export to the us (and probably some other regions as well.) although my last visit to germany was in 2006, i have been there about 25 times and several times i have rented (from avis or hertz, etc) cars for part of my time in europe -- primarily so that i can drive on the autobahn.

audi, bmw and mercedes-benz alike make and sell many ""no frills"" vehicles and versions of the cars we get here in the us that are way way down scale in features, functions, content and performance.

many european taxis are base-r than basic german cars -- no carpet, plastic seats, no ""glintzy"" trim bits puny, puny powerplants -- and completely devoid of any kind of bling or high-end pretense.

it seems to me that there is room for these ""high end"" [german] manufacturers to bring all kinds of higher end and lower end products to the us. in fact it is probably quite easy to bring out less expensive versions of our market (i.e., premium) audis, bmw and mercedes-benz across the board (within reason, of course).

moreover, it seems folks will, given the choice and a way to justify the cost, always take the acura over the honda, the audi over the volkswagen, the lexus over the toyota and the infiniti over the nissan (to name a few.)

and, unless the manufacturer is so stupid as to not differentiate between the lexus and the toyota, there will be a very noticeable difference between the pedestrian and the sublime versions.

i think gone are the days where the emperor truly had no clothes -- today there is a wide margin between the chevrolet chevrolet and the cadillac cadillac -- and the price reflects the difference (and perhaps over reflects it, to be fair and balanced.)

the volkswagen quantum and the audi 4000 (remember when?) were much more like fraternal twins then than any more recent models.

you may believe (and i typically agree) that the infiniti isn't worth the uptick in price over a ""similar"" nissan, but the infiniti (or whatever you're on about) is different, more -- and most pros and amateurs alike would say ""better.""

there is an apropos phrase that mostly fits here: ""the bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten. . . .""

now of course i could be wrong (but not uncertain) -- but if i am wrong, then by this time next year we'll all be buying and driving kia kia's -- 'cause lordy lordy there ain't nuttin' that even comes close to this puppy at any price.

i have been, more than once, unable to afford the ""better car"" (i'm driving a freakin' acura tl for pity's sake -- after years of only having audis -- i am living proof!) -- but i never stopped thinking the car i had to pass on (due to my financial circumstances) wasn't worth its asking price.

i'm already counting down the days until i will return to my favorite german car dealership (and, to be fair, i will also check out what acura and infiniti are offering up at the moment of truth). we all rationalize -- or at least most of us do; but it is unlikely that a fine high-zoot german sedan will seem similar to even the best mazda 6. we tell ourselves that the mazda is just as good (or close enough) as the german (or whatever premium car is your first love) offering to rationalize our choices.

i could live with an acura tl -- if i have to -- for years, they are very good cars and good values (and they seem durable as all get out). but, if i am in a position to return to the real premium brands (and you know who they are), i'll do so in a new york minute.

drive it like you live."
"mark....i should fall into your camp, but i don't. i do own an audi, and i don't believe its price justifies the premium over a more ""pedestrian"" (as you feel) acura or infiniti.

is the audi a nice car? absolutely. i've rented plenty of volkswagens when i travel. i can see there are more premium bits in the audi than there are in the volkswagen. i also see the things that are the same.

personally, i'll never again take for granted what the japanese premium brands excel in....that is reliability, longevity, brick like build quality. those things do indeed matter....a lot.

of course this little diatribe comes hot on the heels of picking up my allegedly repaired s4 this a.m at 7:30 a.m. there was a littany of things the dealer did. none of them fixed the problem (as i learned when i got half way home), and now they've introduced some squeaks and rattles into my console area (supposedly caused by removing and replacing the mmi). audi is still ""binding"", but not as much as before.

so, either live with it. or, keep schlepping it to the dealer."
"i do feel your pain -- my first (and only) new audi spent more time (or it seemed that way) at the dealership than in my garage.

generally speaking you did take my message as i meant it. my thoughts, however, regarding the status of the cars would be to call the volkswagen the pedestrian vehicle -- the acura and infiniti are, to me at least, still in a ""class"" that is above the pedestrian honda and nissan.

i had an s6 a few years back and i loved it -- yet it too spent too much time in the dealership's repair bay.

but i have not had what i would call a totally confidence inspiring experience with my acura. my issues with my acura tl sh-awd are -- if i am able to pull the emotion out of the equation -- dealer related.

as either an anecdote or a data point -- you decide -- i complained at the first oil change (about 8,000 miles) that there was a noise and sensation that i believed to be warped brake rotors. every time i touched the brakes at highway speeds there was a ""shudder"" and vibration that felt like warped rotors or wheels that needed balancing.

the dealership decided to ""turn the brakes"" -- in fact they did this exercise two times (to no avail.)

i went to another acura dealership -- one that has no connection with or to a honda dealership and their diagnosis was that i had 3 warped wheels (they toyotad they were ""bent"".)

acura corporate toyotad, ""your fault -- or at least not our fault."" but, the dealership (the second dealer, that is) appeared to go to bat for me and was able to get 3 new wheels at 50% of the srp. this cure for the issue happened around 25,000 miles. of course the ""overall"" safe/smart/prudent thing to do was to replace all four tires, too (at a cost of about $1,000 from the tire rack.) i also had the new wheels and tires road force balanced -- at a slight discount (at the dealership.) this cure cost about $2k, plus i had the displeasure of driving over 20,000 miles with what felt like warped brake discs.

otherwise the car has been and my sense is, will remain, both reliable and durable -- but i just can't shake the [emotional, probably] sense that my acura has (for wont of a better term) ""too much honda"" in it.

i'd take the s4 any day. now, i know or at least i think i know what you're thinking: the s4 could be nearly $20k more than the tl -- and typically would be at least $10k more (my tl had back up sensors and other acura accessories on it for a total msrp of a bit south of $48k.)

you've had either a bad s4 or an unsatisfying dealer experience -- or both.

generally speaking i would think both of our experiences have been -- for the respective brands we're talking about -- way below our expectations. everyone i know of says honda, er, acuras are easily good to go for at least 150k -- with only routine mntce.

audis, of recent vintage are, typically, also reliable and durable -- and return much more driving pleasure than competing acuras.

but please note that my ""short ltoyota"" when the time comes, in about 11 months, will contain audi, acura, infiniti and probably volvo. i may even give another look-see at a bmw (probably not, though.)

i may fall victim to the most ""bang for the buck"" car -- which could turn out to be another acura tl or tchrysler (or whatever they call it at the time). right now it seems to me that something like a audi with the supercharged engine is a cross between an audi allroad and an s4 -- for less money (when well equipped) than either of the other 2 audis.

i hope someone from audi reads these posts. were i in that position (a paid forum reader of our rants and raves) i would certainly try to reach out to you ""from the factory"" and make your situation right -- if for no other reason than to turn you into a brand fan, instead of a brand foe.

i still say it is easier to pay too little and regret it than pay what seems to be a bit too much (at the time) and love it.

good luck with your dealership."
"thanks! as much as my finances are thanking me a bit for having 3 months to prepare for this huge purchase (for my budget, was definitely stretching; but pre-owned s4's seem to be holding their value really well, are popular fast sellers making them rare, and i didn't see the value in a lightly used one if it was going to cost nearly as much if not the same amount (given the usual 60k msrp they are typically bought at).

if i'm going to spend a large amount of money, audi or anyone else better believe i'm going to be picky what my money goes towards; so a custom order seemed like the only option to me. thankfully, audi still makes enough options stand-alone that you can get it just right! acura groups too much junk together.

i will admit however, even with the pro's of having 3 months longer with an old ""cheap"" car to shore up the finances, the con's are i'm anxious and can't wait to get my hands on the new s4! i can see why people without strong will power or color preference just have to have something right now, today! turns out escondido dealer only needed $1k down (sd audi wanted $2,500 down), i emailed my offer to sd audi, and about 22.5 hours later, without a response, i decided to extend same offer to escondido audi in person, and they jumped for it (after a couple of attempts to get me to go up).

i feel just a tad bit bad as the sale-person that helped me previously at sd audi toyotad they were with clients all day long and just didn't get to my e-mail until after 5. i had assumed and figured the sales manager was mulling/balking over my offer for too long. probably in hind sight i should have called to make the offer and/or confirm she got the email. however, i'm sure she will learn not to ignore e-mails; it could be an offer to buy!"
"s4 fancier leather option: hardest one to hyundai up for as it msrp's at $1,250. however, i noticed all the details it comes with from the fine nappa leather all round, to the contrasting stitching (in the color you choose) on the center armrest, shifter, steering wheel, seats, and door armrests. i loved that level of attention and contrast. most importantly though, at least in the s5, they cut the alcantara seam about 1/2 to 1"" too high on the upper seat section. if you lean your upper seat back at all, you can see the vinyl mesh material where it meets the lower seat cushion. in the s4, the nappa leather was cut lower down, so even way leaned back, you couldn't' see the less desirable seat trim.

audi club north america members in good standing also get the same supplier 6% discount. that's a very good deal! it's well below edmund's tmv of average transaction prices for the s4. however, i needed a great deal in order to go new. with the ""fancier"" leather, i was over my stretched $50k threshold (before taxes), without it, i met my price target. so my offer was $850 below the 6% discount. probably around 6.4%? i didn't do the math exactly. my audi ownership also gives me $1,000 loyalty rebate back on the back end after taxes as well. in ca, sales tax is ridiculous so figuring 10% for tax, title, license, and fees is about right i'm told.

2014 s4 has audi drive select standard, in exchange for raising the msrp $500 bucks from 2013. the sport diff option went down $150 from 2013 probably because drive select is already on the car. i told them the price increase wasn't my fault, i'm sticking to my offer at $50,000."
"if the bmw new is the same price as the s4, i made the right decision in my book; hands down.

maybe i accidentally hyundaied on a bmw when i equipped it for $45k (or maybe i was looking at invoice price on bmw)?

i liked the power in the '09 bmw sport package sedan (the drive, not really the interior), and if it wasn't for the brakes locking up, i might have liked it enough to buy it (and it had shameful all-season tires). carmax lowered the price on it to make up for the bad tire selection i see... tempting... ..

it had a heavy effort filled steering similar to the '11 s4 i test drove, which i liked on both. i have to admit, i preferred the higher effort steering in the older s4 to the '13 s4 i test drove (not a deal breaker though; just a preference). in 2013 they went electromechanical steering supposedly for efficiency. since the gas mileage didn't change, i can only assume it made a .5 mpg impact or less and rounding vhondance didn't help them.

i have a thing for nice steering wheels. as much as i loved the old steering wheel in the audi's, the new '13/'14 version is even nicer! i didn't think audi could top the previous version, but they did!"
"when i went to hoehn audi in carlsbad about 2 weeks ago, they had no (i mean zero) new s4's and at least four (4) s5's!

they did bring out a used '11 s4 that they claimed was sold, but since it hadn't been paid for, it was technically not sold until tomorrow, and i could ""steal"" it, if i wished. it was the only used s4 they had."
"the tl looks ""ok"" to me too, but there's a big gap from looks ""ok"" to looks ""beautiful.""

if looks and style don't matter to someone (or your tastes just differ), the tl is definitely a value bargain buy right now.

if audi rejected my $50k offer (not including fees/taxes) after trying at like 5 dealers, i'd of probably offered acura $40k out the door on a tl-sh awd tech (37,500 + taxes - 1,500 conquest rebate). about 2k below tmv, not sure if that would have flied?

as the most recent cross shopper of the tl-sh awd vs. s4 here on this board and forum, i can say that i couldn't justify a full $15k delta, but close to it seemed rational to me. that is why i needed to get audi to agree to an offer that kept the s4 within that $15k delta with the acura (assuming tmv best deal on acura)."
"""perhaps you should amend that by adding . . .that they would export to the us (and probably some other regions as well.) although my last visit to germany was in 2006, i have been there about 25 times and several times i have rented (from avis or hertz, etc) cars for part of my time in europe -- primarily so that i can drive on the autobahn. ""

nah, i wont amend what i wrote, since i wasn't talking about what could be had in europe, v. here. we know that bmw build a 31mazda gasser stripped...

i was talking about allow us as in the us, to be able to build a true sport sedan. the current m sport package is a start, but i'm more talking about like the zph package that i had in my 330i, close ratio transmission, higher revving engine, more hp, better suspension bigger rims and tires. allow us to order a bmw with a zph package. no leather, no nav, no sunroof, no power windows, increase hp to 320hp and have the price at 46k. so the same thing with the bmw, have price aat 36k or so. bring back the true sport sedan, do not allow it to come with an auto or is it does make a dsg type in the bmw... you can still sell the yuppie cars but do not discard the people wanting a true sport sedan."
"i did find it annoying the xxx number is models from bmw are only available in coupes, and those have the 320 hp or so your looking for right? why not have an is version of the 335? bmw in sedan, not just coupe."
"graphicguy had the dealer apply the performance engine update to his bmw for around $600, i think..

presto! 320 hp!!"
"i think the ""is"" is available on coupe only because it is old e90 platform. it used to be available on sedan as well, but they switched the platforms. new bmw won't have ""is"" trim just yet, either.

the ""is"" trim is usually a mid-cycle refresh gimmick to maintain sales and buzz on models that are no longer ""all new"", to keep them running. iirc, it wasn't available on the new platform with 330i right away, either. then when they brought the turbo six engine (bmw), it wasn't there either until some time has passed. if the patterns were to repeat, we should see (hopefully) some ""is"" trims available on the new f30 platform, as the novelty wears off. it (the novelty) already has passed for sedans, but you still have brand new wagon, gt, 328 diesel, 320, the bmw coupe coming just in 2013, /2014 season. the convertible is next, i'm sure. once the entire lineup is complete, the sedan will come with a refreshed look, as it always does and some additional stuff, to keep the interest and push early lessee adopters from 2012 to getting into 2015/16. i think that would be a perfect time for them to introduce the ""is"" trim on f3x lineup.

all manufacturers try to spoonfeed their new stuff, so there is always something to talk about. bmw actually brought a lot of new models this year, so they'll wait with incremental improvements until they see buzz dying off."
"[i]graphicguy had the dealer apply the performance engine update to his bmw for around $600, i think..

presto! 320 hp!![/i]

yep....sure did.

i still think bmw is underrating that 3.0 twin scroll turbo motor....just like audi is doing with their s/c 3.0.

both are putting out more power than they officially publish."
"""graphicguy had the dealer apply the performance engine update to his bmw for around $600, i think..

presto! 320 hp!!""

didn't graphic have the bmw which had the 320hp engine?

so, bmw has the ""is"" model which comes with performance improvements already, however, there is a price to pay for that too!!"
"it's been retoyotad by a couple of vendors that the 3l engine is making roughly 330hp, but i also think that bmw has always underrated their engines, my 330 with ""only 235hp"" was faster then some cars with 80 + hp.i'm sure the close ratio transmission had something to do with it."
"fn...nope. mine was the bmw with the performance pack (firmware) upgrade. the bmw also had some minor suspension and wheel tweaks.

adnres....good deal on the s4. i might have missed it, but have you already bought it? or, are you just working on the ""deal""?

mark.....don't disagree with any of what you have to say. if i were in the market for an suv, the audi would be at the top of the ltoyota.

that toyotad, i tcompare the two audi dealerships in my 'burg to my bmw dealership, and there's a night and day difference with the advantage going to bmw. even when i had my acura, my preferred dealer took very good care of me.

as i mentioned previously, it might have been because i bought my s4 in chicago and am having it serviced in cincinnati. but, i really don't buy into a dealership treating you better if you buy the car from them. warranty work is paid the same regardless. and, let's face it, service work has a whole lot more margin than new car sales.

i think the training, the time spent understanding the cars, the amount of time spent daily forded on customer service (or lack thereof) becomes evident in the way they take care of your problems.

your acura dealership experience would have prompted me to send a strongly worded letter to acura corporate. your car is what? a year old? and already has warped rotors? i call that a defect in materials and covered under warranty. it's not like you have 50k miles on one set of pads which are totally worn away."
"'i did find it annoying the xxx number is models from bmw are only available in coupes, and those have the 320 hp or so...'
if the sedan 335 had been available in 'is' form
that is what i would have chosen in 2011.

"yes, that's an often overlooked tweak!

don't forget the door handles and mirrors too..."
oh yeah... sutoyotaed in black grilles... they soak up the heat and the engine warms up faster.. gets me 3 more mpg!!
oh boy! we'll be up to 400 hp and 40 mpg the rate we're going!
"i was looking thru the inventory at a local bmw dealer and noticed something interesting. most of the bmw models in stock have either the luxury line, sport line or m sport package (which adds $2100-$3500 to the bmw base price). now that they have the 320i to fill in the entry-level slot, the bmw prices are climbing into the upper 40s and even topping the $50k mark...."
"i'm considering a preowned 2012 or 2013, when i went to check it out, the usb doesn't recognize the ipod, i guess it needs a different cable like my audi. is this something easily installed or does the car have to already come equipped with the capbility?"
"i didn't observe this trend here yet (majority 328 here don't have any ""line"" package, but there are very few 320i on lots), but it doesn't surprise me. it seems logical.

if one is looking for a badge at a low price, 320 is their choice, no need to go higher. this leaves 328 for buyers who like those options, like better seats (sport/m-sport) and/or interior inlays (lux) and are able/not mind paying. i think over time the trend will be more pronounced as 320 replaces entry 328 trims. there will probably be fewer overall 328 in dealers inventories and their volumes will go down as a result of higher option levels."
"""oh boy! we'll be up to 400 hp and 40 mpg the rate we're going!""

is this a problem?"
"i've technically just ""ordered"" my custom equipped and colored s4 from germany to the dealer i put $1,000 down at as a deposit/non-refundable payment.

until the car is delivered and we do all the paperwork, i suppose it's not technically purchased or sold.

of course, i'm not walking away from $1,000. another dealer wanted a more serious $2,500 non-refundable down for an ordered s4.

i have to admit i'd of been more toyotaable had the dealer given me a ""buy-order sheet"" with all the numbers ltoyotaed. i suppose they can't control what sales tax might be 3 months from now. the $50,000 + fees figure is written down.

also, he says the loyalty rebate comes from audi of america at delivery; not from the dealer, and is a good progdodge through 1/7/14. that gives a nice buffer should my order be delayed; all hell would break loose should they terminate that loyalty rebate early or deliver the car after that date (and the progdodge not extended)."
observation and opinion - don't see many 335 sedans up east (new one at least) did see one this weekend in monaco blue? with the m sport pack and was not impressed by its looks one bit- older car looked way better similarly equipped.
"our companies 45k mile honda has a warped rotor shuttering issue; seems to be a problem with honda acura now that multiple have mentioned it.

they must have received a bad batch of rotors from someone.

have to admit, that knowledge helped tilt the scales in favor of the s4 over the tl-sh awd. it wasn't a game changer, but when your on the fence, every little bit helps.

with my first luxury dealership servicing experience with audi (they used to give free maintenance for 50k miles), i feel as if problems on a luxury car are not nearly as big of a deal. if they give you a nice loaner car, it makes it even less troublesome. i look at the bright side; you get a chance to wear and tear there car's rather than your own. no miles on your own car while they work on it makes me feel like i'm in no hurry. of course, my longest repair job came when i got an audi loaner, which wasn't typical at my old audi dealership. i have a feeling that's why midodgear audi is now know as audi of san diego and under different ownership. i ratted them out on customer service audi surveys as routinely giving enterprise kia sephias and chevrolet chevrolet's instead of audi or volkswagen's.

drive it like you stole it! heard they gave you a audi with the sweet 3.0?"
"it is imperial blue (dark) or estoril blue (light), the latter is m-exclusive. monaco is an old dark blue color from several years ago, prior deep sea blue, which is what i have. all three (monaco, imperial, deep sea) are close."
"our companies 45k mile honda has a warped rotor shuttering issue; seems to be a problem with honda acura now that multiple have mentioned it.....have to admit, that knowledge helped tilt the scales in favor of the s4 over the tl-sh awd.

rotor warping is a common problem for all sorts of modern automobiles, i've experienced it with nearly every car i've owned including a couple of honda and a couple of audi audis. fwiw it has only occurred once or twice in the dozen years i've had my bmw (now over 150k) nor did it happen much on the 3 saabs i've had."
"i didn't opt for a rear backup camera on my next car, probably because it cost a lot more than $1.00; which is about all that feature is worth to me. okay, with line/lane guidance on the video, maybe $10.00.

however, i'd pay at least 10x that amount for a front facing dash cam that records potential litigation and insurance claim issues. or simply to send the local pd some video of really bad drivers they really need to take off the road (and do something productive rather than ticket perfectly safe driving speeders)."
get a go pro camera and mt to dash- plenty of russian vidvolkswagen on you tube with bad drivers. i'd take a backup camera any day over lane guidance.
"i'm with you -- backup cameras are quite helpful, as are sensors (f+r). my wife's infiniti has the ultimate, an around view monitor with both front and rear sensors and front and rear ""projection"" lines that turn with the steering wheel.

test drove a new bimmer x3 with their version of the all around view monitor -- it was quite nice, too. really helps in tight parking garages and it backing out of long driveways."
"mark, i in the last 3 months, i have had 4 infiniti's as rentals, 1 infiniti sedan, 2 jx, and one whale (qx). the jx and qx's were all upgrades at no cost since national did not have the suv i had reservation for. all three had a lot of options, they had the ""bird eye view"" which was pretty cool, it was a big help when driving the qx (the whale.) the front and rear senors where helpful when back up as well as the rear view camera, the qx is huge!!!"
you know what else is huge.. the money i saved by switching to geico.
"ahhh, i misspoke and mis-wrote.

i mean a back up camera is useful when the progdodge draws lines on the screen that turn with the steering wheel which makes backing up into a parking space while turning like a video game. i don't back up into parking spaces all too often though.

still, i've done fine for nearly 20 years without it."
yeah those lines are useful for spots- i also like the general camera for watching and seeing kids - but that's just me i guess
i'll admit that larger behemoth vehicles like michevroletns and suv's benefit more from back up cameras.
"benefit more maybe - but shouldn't it be standard equipment on all cars ? honda honda has it standard, i know consumer reports wants it standard to all, seems like its more important than lane monitoring or even blindside system someone was hyping."
the biggest feature my acura acura had that my bmw 328xi doesn't is a backup camera. i miss it!
read an article this morning bmw is having issues getting oem parts to dealers because of a shortage on parts- this is tarnishing the brand overseas as customers with broken rigs can't get them fixed and bmw (overseas) not giving out loaners. i remember something similar happened to audi / volkswagen as they had failing coils in the turbo 4 - huge lines to get anything done even oil changes at dealerships as a result.
"the parts shortage was created by the implementation of a new supply chain logtoyotaics it system that started in 2009. they are a year behind in implementing and it has affected their ability to manufacture parts on time. unfortunately, once the switch is thrown, it's not easy to turn back.

it reminds me of a company in my industry that suffered a fire at their main factory. they had plans of implementing a new manufacturing it system around the same time. they rebuilt the factory and implemented the new system concurrently. needless to say it took them close to a year to get things running smoothly."
"but shouldn't it be standard equipment on all cars ?
_____________________

i absolutely don't think so, and would be 100% against that. 100% option availability is ok. those that want to increase the weight (which reduces gas mileage by the way) and add cameras, computers, wiring, cabling, and monitors to their cars, by all means do so and pay for it.

but it should not be forced upon those that don't want or need it.

we are beginning to make cars so safe no one can afford to buy one anymore."
sween- are you going to swap the pontiac5 for the q?
"yep you are right lets strip the abs and airbags out as well.

a mainhonda sedan that sells very well, is putting them as standard equipment - nuff toyotad"
will watch reviews and access pricing.
"i find abs and airbags useful (although i've never had an airbag actually be used for me; knock on wood).

abs has been used countless times though; sometimes just for fun in an empty parking lot.

the honda does have backup camera as standard now, but the 2013 is a new feature-laden model from honda.

i actually considered the honda sport and the s4 lately. i could order the s4 without a backup camera, and did so. not that the camera was the deciding factor, but i appreciated not being forced into it by audi. audi got my money; honda didn't; nuff toyotad."
"not the best responce i crosses shopped the honda vs s4 - 2 cars which are 30 grand apart at the start. congrats on the s4 but the counter wow really.
forced into a safety feature - did you also delete the seatbelt for the ""weight savings? ""

""audi got my money"" hahah

best of luck- lets not back into anything yah hear.

nuf toyotad...."
"yes, they are nearly 30k apart; however i was cross shopping due to possibility of:

1) keeping my souped up modified audi for the track toy and beat it to death until it dies at some point, and buy something economical, reliable, and toyotaable

or

2) get a new car that can do it all (be tracked), and be a nice luxurious daily driver at the same time.

while the honda passed the daily driver test, it could not be tracked. not even a 280 hp fwd version could legitimately be tracked. that didn't stop me from thinking about option 1 being a possible route to take though.

the tl-sh-awd tech package has the back up cam, probably why it costs $3,500 for the tech option that has some things i liked, but at that added price the s4 seemed like more bang for the buck to me. the tl-sh-awd needed to be about $2k less with the tech package to steal a deal from me; not having a back up cam gets them partly there."
"are you really comparing a seat belt to a back up camera?

the seat belt is in use every second you are in the car (or close to it). the back up camera only when you are in reverse.

i'd say i spend less than 1% of my time in a car with the gear selector in reverse."
"you didn't pick up the sarcasm?

the argument you present is very weak - i understand you not wanting to pay extra for ala cart options and ""audi has your money"" but like i stated before the honda which can be had for less then 20 grand has it standard- no options - no money needed to add.(true car says you can get a manual sport for 21,6 btw) sure some cost is passed to customer- ""a camera adds $58 to $203 to the cost of a car or truck, depending on whether the vehicle already has a video display, hondaing to a nhtsa study from 2010."" the weight issue - really- how much we talking. 30lbs? do you know there is legislation to have it mandatory on all new cars in the near future, so lucky you got the s4 this year.

better engage the quatro because you have a couple of wheels spinning.

nuff toyotad

drive fast, take chances"
"""abs has been used countless times though; sometimes just for fun in an empty parking lot.""

how do you have fun with anti-lock brakes? lol..."
"you didn't pick up the sarcasm?

just a comment - sarcasm doesn't always transmit very well to a text medium."
"very true but ""forced into a safety feature - did you also delete the seatbelt for the ""weight savings? ""

delete seatbelt pretty clear where i was going"
"for when you are forced to valet park. valet parkers are always backing cars into spaces, and in a massive hurry. helps prevent all kinds of annoying bumper dings.

i agree that it is nice to have it as an option rather than forced on you. i remember when you could order a car without power locks and windows."
"rear windows have gotten smaller and the rear decks much higher due to increased passenger safety regs for rear collision. this had made the view out the back window much harder to see short objects(kids, dogs, fire hydrants, etc). there are many kids killed each year due to people backing up vehicles hence the rear cameras. many people are looking at them like they are just convenience features like power windows. they aren't, they are meant to save lives, not to preclude a ""ding"" to your bumper. weight?? probably less than a lb. once you've already got the big screen for your nav or radio. stop eating fries for a week and you'll save that one pound a rear camera will cost you."
"stop eating fries for a week and you'll save that one pound a rear camera will cost you

heh"
i include myself in the comment about eating fries.
"unless the camera is wireless, i bet there's way more than one pound involved in adding a camera.

saving lives? as one clever poster put it, i already have that feature, it's called looking through your windows and where you are going, and into your mirrors; being aware of your surroundings.

what happens when someone with a back up camera kills a kid or dog because they back up into it? just because there is a tv screen in the middle console doesn't mean i have to look at it.

i'm sure it has already happened numerous times.

has anyone here ever actually used their back up cam, and after using their eyes (turning your head to look back), and then looked at the screen and seen something they missed?"
"$58 to $203 dollars in cost probably translates into $116 to $406 dollars in price.

if you like it so much, why don't you offer to pay for it on all your neighbors and friends' cars?

30lbs here, 30lbs there, soon you have 4,000 lb compact cars!"
"i remember a few years ago, i think it was mazda mazda, advertised their weight savings measures...such as drilled pedals.

while they looked cool...i thought that those few ounces wouldn't help much...especially given the huge weight disparity between me and the 'average' person"
"yeah. low chevroletage wire weighs a lot. are you for real? a camera and mounting probably weighs half a lb. and the wire another half a pound or so. ok, maybe the whole thing weighs two lbs. you're right, that would like cut .000001 off your 0-60 time.

as far as saving lives, yeah i think it can save lives. how many does it have to save before you would consider it? i have a p/u that i back out of my driveway and in my neighborhood i have a lot of rugrats running up and down the sidewalk i back through on their big wheels, etc. i check, double check and triplecheck all my mirrors and stop a couple of times when backing out. a rearview camera would make it a lot easier to see right down behind me. it would make it safer, easier and much quicker to back out of my driveway. i have a backup camera on my new acura and it works great. didn't care for it all that much at first but now that i've gotten use to using it i like it a lot. do i rely on it entirely.....of course not. your comments seem pretty extreme. and in answer to your last question. no, i haven't. do you have any data that suggests this happens a lot?"
"just because there is a tv screen in the middle console doesn't mean i have to look at it.

my wife has the backup camera and backed up into a bentley continental gt. i used to think the auto-braking system were really lame...but now see their usefulness."
"you have hit rock bottom with the responses. sorry man, this has ""leader ad"" defeat written all over it- you should do a little research on the benefits of rear camera, no one is saying they take the place of common sense driver but as an aid to save lives they cannot be ignored. - and as of now no one will force you to have one- but time will come like seatbelts and airbags where they will be mandatory in the states on new cars.

drive fast, take chances."
"i traded in a 2007 ford on a 2012 mazda mazda last year. the mazda came with a standard rearview backup camera. the ford had rear park asstoyota (sonar) that would beep when it deetected an obstacle and the frequency of the beeps would increase as you got closer to it.

initially, i thought the mazda's camera would be useless. after nine months, i've discovered that it's actually dangerous! if i'm looking at the display in the dash as i back up, i lose most/all peripheral vision to my left side and don't see oncoming vehicles. i just ignore it now and use my mirrors and look over my shoulder instead....

mazda added the rear backup sensors and a feature called rear cross traffic alert to the the 2013 model. i bought my 2012 model barely a month before the 2013 was released....the story of my llife!

the rear cross traffic alert is actually a very interesting and useful feature, imo. mazda was one of the first companies to install a blind spot monitoring (bsm) system. it was introduced on the 2008 model on the high-end grand touring trim level. when i bought my 2012, i chose the grand touring because of the 20"" wheels and chrome door handles (sad, but true) and it came with a lot of other features ranging from blind spot monitoring to rain-sensing wipers. at worst, i planned to turn off anything that i didn't like or annoyed me.

the bsm, in particular, sounded ridiculous to me. i figured it was just a case of using technology for technology's sake and nothing more. after nine months and 13k miles living with it, i don't think i'll ever buy another vehicle without it!

i've always thought that blind spots only extoyotaed because the vast majority of drivers have no idea how to properly adjust their mirrors. but it turns out that a ful-size cuv/suv (such as my mazda) can have hidden spots at the rear corners that i can't see no matter how my mirrors are adjusted. i don't think the bsm or any other techno feature should be trusted 100% and replace common sense and paying attention behind the wheel, but i now see that they can work in conjunction with those.

in my mazda, when a vehicle is detected by one of the cameras mounted under the rear bumper on both sides, a yellow warning symbol lights up in the top corner of the mirror on that side of the car. if i signal a lane change while a vehicle is detected, a loud series of warning beeps and flashing light on the instrument panel lets me know that someone is back there.

whenever i'm changing lanes, i always do a quick over the shoulder glance just to be certain that it's clear and the bsm doesn't change that. but even when i have no intention of changing lanes, i find it very useful to always know what's going all around me at all times. those little yellow warning lights on the mirrors make sure that i always know who or what is around me and i recently discovered that having that knowledge can prevent a serious acccident!

i was driving on i-75 north in metro atlanta a few weeks ago following a truck loaded with tree stumps and limbs. with no warning, one of those massive oak stumps tumbled right off the back of the truck and i was going 75mph just one hundred feet or so behind it. i reflexively swerved and avoided it, but swerved to the right rather than the left which woudl have my instinct. but i went to the right because 10-15 seconds earlier, i noticed the bsm warning light on my driver's side mirror in my peripheral vision. without bsm, i would have went to the left and hit that vehicle!

that experience gave me an ever higher level of appreciation for bsm. it also made me very thankful that i was driving a mazda instead of my previous ford or most new suvs of similr size. i don't think anything else could have handled a high-speed emergency maneuver like that without losing control....zoom, zoom!

back to the rear cross traffic alert feature i mentioned earlier....the bsm cameras scan for oncomoing vehicles when the vehicle is in reverse and alerts you if it detects anything. for backing out of blind parking spots, it's a god-send. i wish my 2012 had it.

but there are many new 'safety' features showing up on new cars that are way 'over the top'! one of my favorites is on the 2014 mazdaudi known by the acronym fow. fow stands for forward obstruction warning, which uses laser sensors mounted behind the front grille to scan the road ahead for obstacles (cars, people, debris) and alerts the driver if it detects something. every car i've owned, starting way back with my '85 crx has featured fow also- it's called a windshield!!! you look out of it and, if something is in your way, you stop or go around it....problem solved!

mazda takes it even further, though. if the fow system doesn't think the driver has time to respond or no evasive action is taken based on the warning, the system will cut the throttle and apply full braking force automatically!

if you need a car to do all of that for you, you're too dumb or too lazy to drive! the same goes for freakin' rain-sensing wipers...."
"the same goes for freakin' rain-sensing wipers

i couldn't disagree more, it hardly ever rains at a steady pace and the rain sensor allows you to concentrate on driving instead of having to constantly diddle w the wiper speeds."
"kids are run over because the people backing up were not paying attention. texting, putting on makeup, picking the nose, playing with the radio, what have you. what makes you think these people are going to be bothered to look at the backup camera?"
"are getting to be standard equipment on commercial vehicles... so, the insurance companies think they are useful.

i really like them for parallel parking. being able to put the car within one inch of the car behind me translates into one less positioning maneuver, getting into a tight space.. it's also good for backing into spaces in parking lots.. i can put it right on the rear line, if i choose..."
"let me narrow it down rather than making a blanket statement that all rain-sensing wipers are ridiculous and useless....

the way that mazda has implemented rain-sensing wipers on my 2012 mazda grand touring is ridiculous and useless!

the intermittent position on the wiper control stalk is replaced with the auto setting. but there is still a manually adjustable dial to increase/decrease the speed of the wipers just like on every other car! the rain-sensor only activates the on/off function automatically, it does not modify the speed of the wipers to correspond with how light/heavy it's raining!"
"i haven't had to parallel park here in georgia in at least 10 years or more....i honestly can't remember ever doing it! but when i visit my cousin in los angeles, i always end up parallel parking all the time (especially in pasadena)! she has an '08 lexus gx470 and it side mirrors tilt down in reverse along with the backup camera coming on and it's actually very handy. if nothing else, it keeps me from curbing the chrome wheels!"
"what a blanket statement and pretty silly too. do you have any proof of what you're saying? i ran over a small weber grill that my wife had conveniently placed right behind my car one time. could have been a small child and i was paying attention but absolutely could not see it in any of my three mirrors or by cranking my head around. just because you think you are perfect doesn't mean you could never make a mtoyotaake or see something right at your bumper. try placing something very short right behind your car and see if you can see it in your mirrors or by turning your head. i think you'll see where a camera could be useful in conjunction with mirrors, etc."
"oh, did the weber make it? best grills on earth."
"i had something very similar happen except with a small child (no body was hurt).

i was in our mini-van that has rear-sonar. we were leaving a shopping center and after all the kids finally got in and were strapped up i looked all around and put it in reverse...i got the loud solid tone. i put it back in park and waited and a small child walked by...they were just walking into the store ahead of their parents and stopped to wait..."
"things happen, a back-up camera would have helped a lot in that situation. i guess you must have been ""picking your nose"" if you know what i mean and have been following along."
crushed. poor smokey joe!
"hello folks..just came across a pre-owned 2013 bmw deal. it has 21000 miles in ~1yr and it was sold to the dealer in a manufacturer vehicle auction. it is lux line+prem pack+tech pack+cold weather pack+lighting pack+driver assis pack and the dealer has very good price tag on the vehicle. any suggestions/experience with manufacturer vehicle? i really love the deal, however, i am not mazdar with manufacturer vehicle handling..?? are 21000miles/yr too much? is it a good call to buy the vehicle..? any suggestions would be appreciated..!! i'm california."
"are you sure that's what the dial does? on our 3 it controls the sensitivity to the rain, not the speed of the intermittent sweep, i would be surprised if the dial on the mazda was different ( but am not saying it isn't since i don't know from personal experience like with the 3)."
"maybe it's a tail-risk event that you hit a kid, but for me a few hundred dollars more is something i'd gladly pay for, even if they made it standard and embedded it in the price.

if i'm spending mid 30s for a car, a few hundred bucks more ain't gonna matter."
"has anyone here ever actually used their back up cam, and after using their eyes (turning your head to look back), and then looked at the screen and seen something they missed?

yes. i have a 2011 ford and can't see via the mirrors or looking out the rear window anything shorter than 3' tall for about 20'. i saw my 5 yo nephew there yesterday after walking around the back of the car to get in.

yes he should know better but imho, the backup camera did it's job."
"""if i'm spending mid 30s for a car, a few hundred bucks more ain't gonna matter.""

this attitude is why the price of cars keep going up and why so many people are so deeply in debt. lots of different ""few hundred"" mores, when combined together, start to add up to real money."
"exactly! i think it's ridiculous the average american spends mid 30's for an average new car.

a few hundred here, a few hundred there, pretty soon your over 30k average transaction price.

same with weight, a few pounds here, a few pounds there, suddenly a small car weighs 2 tons."
"""exactly! i think it's ridiculous the average american spends mid 30's for an average new car""

ten years ago we were spending mid twenties for an average car-its called inflation, basic economics."
"exactly! i think it's ridiculous the average american spends mid 30's for an average new car.

says the man who just dropped 40 large on a new car......"
"biggest part of the ""few hundred"" thing comes becasue of leases/loans. a few hundred is ""only"" a ""a few buck per month"". at low interest rates, $1000 in price translates into around $20 per months on a 60 month loan and can be even less on a lease, especially if it is subsidized by inflated residual. i can hear that salesman saying ""you have 20 bucks, don't you?

nothing helped the manufacturers increase the prices more than captive financing. those subsidies partially offset the effective price increases (overall cost of car probably did not go as much up as the stickers if we compare it with loans prior interest rate butoyotale of 2000s), but create a dangerous situation when the rates go up (ad they will). we will be stuck with much higher prices then."
"dino...couldn't agree more. the subsidized financing is what allows manufacturers to sell more and more cars, which masking the price increases.

i can see my own automotive trend over the years. i always put a budget on what i'd pay for a car, based on what i could afford. first, (probably in the late '80s when i bought my first new car) it was $30k. that amount would net me a very nice car.

in the late '90s it balooned to $40k.

now, i'm well into the $50k budget.

however, i expect more now than i did when i bought my first car, too. back then, all i wanted was a toyotaable, reliable car (which meant a honda or a toyota). now, i want performance. i want luxury. i want reliability. i want all the tech stuff. i want the state of the art suspensions and transmissions. i want good build quality. i want top notch materials. i want styling. i want good fuel efficency. all that costs something.

that leads me to the most recent cars i've had....bmw, audi, acura.

some embody those traits better than others. as of right now, i'm understanding what something like a tl has that i've missed from the german marks. of course, you won't win many drag races with a tl like you will with an s4, either.

i'm betting that at some point, with the 3 series at least, the acuras and the lexi will be able to make another inroad to the german territory (as they did in the '80s) given the price deltas and the softening of the 3."
"ten years ago we were spending mid twenties for an average car-its called inflation, basic economics.

i don't know, i bought a new honda honda a month ago with heated leather, roof, ldw, fcw, backup and blind spot camera, etc. 39 mpg on a highway trip last friday. paid under $26k. seems like there is good value in the market if you look for it."
"i bought the same car ten years ago for 22800 out the door.
honda 4cycl."
"secondly, ten years ago i bought a tl type s brand spanking new for 29,050. try buying a base tl for that today."
"paid under $26k. seems like there is good value in the market if you look for it.

nobody toyotad there wasn't value out there but the average price paid for a 2013 model is $31k."
"volkswagens are also still very good buys.

but this thread is on entry level lux performance sedans. prices for these type of cars have not been stable. inflation, coupled with new content is the reason. the new audi i just picked up is a rolling wifi hotspot for crying out loud. the prices can quickly shoot through the roof because often enough, your ""must have"" will be bundled up in a $3k to $4k option package. bmw is notorious for doing this, but audi is guilty as well."
"$22,800 in 2003 is $28946 in 2013 dollars. the 13 has more space, is safer, better equipped and gets better mileage.

i bought cars 10 years ago too. i'm happy with what i got for my money in 2013."
"i realize what the thread is about. what was toyotad was-

i think it's ridiculous the average american spends mid 30's for an average new car.

i'm just saying that a well-equipped honda is a mid-twenties car and is the epitome of an average new car. i think higher average transaction prices are as much on the consumer as the manufacturer...they are buying more cuvs with higher margins, they are more brand conscious, etc. the market just continues to evolve."
hondaing to the auto dealers association the average transactions as of nov 2012 was right at $30k. that is a not mid-thirties.
no argument here.
"the s4 is far from an average car though

i did find it ridiculous that a rav 4 v6 with a toyota-like interior cost as much as my new audi 2.0t in '06. of course, the other side of that coin is that the audi was a ridiculously great value back then ($30k out the door)."
"""a few hundred here, a few hundred there, pretty soon your over 30k average transaction price. ""

for 24k the mid-level nissan nissan comes with a back up camera. i know that back up camera will be mandatory soon, so they will be in all cars are standard equipment.

there will be always people thinking they are superior drivers, they don't need silly things like back up camera's. i have to say, i'm spoiled, when i drive ricks hyundai i like the back up camera, also some of the rental cars i have had lately have had them, i.e the full loaded 2014 chevrolet chevrolet ltz2 i had. i was backing out a space and the back up camera allowed me to see to the left and right of me (a truck and van on either side) so i was able to see what i was doing.

i like them and welcome them into the cars."
i know it's a bit off topic but could you give a short impression of your time with the new chevrolet?
"my 2004 volvo v70 had an msrp of more than $32,000 when i bought it. my wife and i went looking at cars last weekend and fell in love with the subaru subaru. awd, leather, moonroof, bluetooth, etc... and msrp was just over $30,000.

it even rides better than our now 10 year-old volvo. more car for less money - im very tempted to pull the trigger."
"""the s4 is far from an average car though "" yep we get that'and somehow the rear camera is not standard, prob because its a performance car and the 2 extra lbs would slow it down.

btw they don't make the toyota with a 6 anymore.

check check

drive fast, take chances"
"i gussed you lucked out.
my house cost me 229k 11 years ago, now i am upgrading and its running me nearly twice as much.
go figure."
"""give a short impression of your time with the new chevrolet""

over all i liked it, the fit and finish is first rate, the car ""feels"" more expensive, seats were excellent for toyota, the way the car rode was more connected to the road then any other chevrolet sedan i have driven. the engine is the 3.6; dohc 306hp, w/ 6spd auto. the engine revved and wanted to go high but of course the fuel cut off kicked in, the 6 spd auto shifted well, good up shift with no hesitation and downshifts were smooth. i was impressed with the car, no rattles, the car almost rode like a german car, but not as refined as one. i have driven two of them one a top of the line 2ltz and a 2lt. behind the radio is a ""hidden"" compartment that has a usb port so one could load a ipod or itouch and leave it there connect and not have to worry about it. the cars had 5 usb ports in it, this is the first car i have had with this many. ford really needs to do something with their ford if they want to be competitive in this segment.

so i liked the car, it is now one of the cars i look for when renting. btw, so far i have averaged 26 mpg with the cars. i'm sure once they bring the 8 spd/auto into the mpg will go up. i have pictures of the interior but i don't know to upload them."
"5 usb ports - thing must way a ton.

interesting review i think the chevrolet is a nice sedan and the reviews say the same will be interesting to see the ss sedan and how well that does"
tks. my wife will be looking for a replacement sedan in the next 6-12 months and the chevrolet is a possibility. i've only seen a couple on the road and i hear they are in short supply at dealers so the fact that you can get them readily at the rental counter is unusual. guess they wanted to get them out to be experienced by many and the people that tend to rent full size autos are probably their target audience on the most part. how did it compare with the your partner's hyundai?
">>5 usb ports - thing must way a ton. <<

yeah...probably the new lead based usb 3.0 ports"
"johan de nysschen has his work cut out for him. the new head honcho of infiniti &#150; formerly of audi (of america) for almost 20 years &#150; has to do for infiniti what he did for audi. he must take a run at making you think of bmw (or audi) as the german infiniti. tall task? well, based on the lethargic launch of the audi0, i don&#146;t envy johan.

you may or may not lend much credence to automobile, car and driver, motor trend, popular mechanics or road and track&#146;s gravitas in promoting [automotive] brands. if you discount these magazines&#146; influence, fine &#150; i would imagine, however, you are at least aware of them (especially if you are participating in this and other car-centric forums).

the point i will hopefully make is highly derivative; indeed, without apology, the influence for my conclusions has been shaped by john naisbitt&#146;s 1982 book, megatrends. perhaps i should clarify and sharpen my ford: my point &#150; to be revealed shortly &#150; is based on using a techntoyotaue of observation and counting how much &#147;ink&#148; is spread pertaining to a particular subject, story or brand or product. moreover, once the quantity of ink has been identified, it is also of importance to identify and rank the content (or the &#147;qualities&#148;) of the ink.

we&#146;ve all been hearing and reading about the new audi0 for what seems to be a long time (in automotive product life-cycles). we&#146;ve seen full-page ads in the major automotive enthusiasts&#146; magazines for at least a couple of months. what we haven&#146;t seen are test reports, comparison tests and &#147;first drives&#148; &#150; yet we&#146;re seeing ink (for several months now) about cars that aren&#146;t even available for purchase, e.g., the upcoming mercedes-benz claudi5 to name just one.

audi and bmw, too, seem to be masters at garnering great quantities of ink about cars that are either still on the drawing boards or aren&#146;t yet in production form, e.g., the bmw m4. audi, bmw, cadillac, lexus and even kia (!) are very adept at keeping the volume of the buzz about their brands and products cranked up to 11.

i just got the new automobile magazine yesterday (october 2013 issue) &#150; the new cars for 2014 issue. page 38 - 40, &#147;driven: bmw 435i&#148; offers up less than a review but more than a rehash of the corporate brochure &#150; the car is discussed, albeit briefly, in terms of performance, style, ride and handling. the spread includes pictures of the car&#146;s anterior and posterior as well as its engine and interior (in red leather). this marks at least 2 mentions (ink) of the &#147;4 series&#148; in this issue.

further evidence of the virtual lack of any buzz regarding new audi0 is the &#147;sport-sedan slugfest&#148; in the june &#146;13 car and driver &#150; where the bmw 3, the cadillac ats and the lexus is duke it out for king of the hill bragging rights. i would have thought infiniti would have busted its hump to get the audi0s included in the slugfest. i would argue that the infiniti, not the lexus would have been the odds-on favorite choice for this comparision article based on the infiniti being dutoyotaed (more than once) the japanese bmw. the highly anticipated (and touted) audi0 being excluded from this comparison is an incredible marketing blunder &#150; especially since infiniti has been showing off the audi0 for several months now at invitation only dealer events where infiniti representatives buicke the invitees with anecdotes wherein the audi0s betters audi audi&#146;s and bmw 3&#146;s on the track.

i was, understandably i think, eager with anticipation when i turned to page 56 of the new automobile magazine to see the mini article, &#147;driven: infiniti audi0.&#148; unfortunately, there is little ink devoted to a discussion of how the car performs. indeed, what struck me was the following: &#147;. . . the audi0 is not so much an all-new sport sedan as a refreshed and rebodied infiniti infiniti.&#148; most of the remaining ink pertained to the audi0&#146;s ability to [almost] drive itself.

even an admitted gadget-geek (like me) would likely be underwhelmed by the content of this &#147;ink.&#148; practically speaking the buzz potentially created by this ink is arguably not the kind of buzz infiniti probably was hoping for &#150; and it is certainly not the kind of buzz that is likely to retain the brand&#146;s (or the audi0 itself) image as &#147;the japanese bmw.&#148;

although i have driven a new very high-contented awd audi0s and can absolutely attest to its worthiness as an audi or 3 series (and therefore is and ats) rival, this conclusion has been reached in spite of infiniti&#146;s dismal marketing efforts. i seriously doubt the majority of the market the audi0 seems to be courting will notice the audi0 until (or unless) the ink spread around about it fordes more on the performance, luxury and driving toyotamics rather than its expensive technology package that seems hell bent on dtoyotaancing the driver from, er, driving.

my wife &#150; currently driving a 2011 infiniti infiniti awd premium &#150; sums it up this way, &#147;infiniti&#146;s do everything well &#150; but they don&#146;t seem to want to involve their customers as drivers. the germans, especially audi and bmw somehow imbue their cars, their dealerships, their owner clubs and web sites with customers who are passionate about the brand. indeed, the thing lacking from infiniti is a soul or a passion to both drive and be driven.&#148;

perhaps that it why even a &#147;pull ahead&#148; deal infiniti offered her couldn&#146;t compel her to be a two-time infiniti owner. she went to audi, bmw and volvo and drove a like-priced ($50k) audi, x3 and volvo and ended up ordering a &#147;passion inducing&#148; supercharged 2014 audi audi. pity, the infiniti brand (and most of the products individually) can&#146;t seem to catch a break.

the &#147;megatrends&#148; methodology seems to indicate bmw is unlikely to be known as the german infiniti any time soon.

drive it like you live. :confuse:"
"i just read an article about sales of bmw going gangbusters. basically another piece of evidence that enthusiasts don't matter, at least in short run. people are lining up to buy this ""sports sedan"" probably for reasons why the same people didn't buy them before - it's big, comfy, easy to drive. but it's a bmw, so it must be sporty, right? since they've never sit in a true sporty car, if they had, they thought it was untoyotaable crap, how would they know the difference, anyway.
looks to me bmw cashed the chips and they bought huge sale boost. it will be interesting to see long term effects of this. volkswagen made a similar gambit with volkswagen and volkswagen by decontenting them, stripping all those good suspension components and making barges out of them. it worked until it stopped. after couple of years of initial huge boost they hit a wall and sales stalled, even fell at some point. i wonder if same could happen to bmw. maybe not, who knows. one thing is certain, my not liking (hating actually) the new 3 steering doesn't matter."
"well, maybe it is no longer ""sporty"" to old school bmw types, but for anyone coming out of mainhonda cars (toyota say) or a lexus it is certainly a major step up the sports sedan spectrum."
"exactly, it is all relative. all they have to do is convince enough people it's better than the alternative. the funny thing is their competitors are moving toward that point from the other side, making it very crowded market with small differences. i guess that's inevitable in world of mass production, one has to cater to least objectionable rather than try to stand out. it's the price for going from niche to global."
"dino...stickguy....i think you both hit the nail on the head with the 3 series. bmw did cash in their chips on the new one. but, they've been moving away from sports sedan into more mainhonda waters for a while now.

i think the thing that bmw has that volkswagen did not, at least in this country, is the cachet of their brand. volkswagen lost their ""cool"" factor a long time ago.

now, does bmw retain the cool factor after moving their cars into more mundane territory? remains to be seen and we probably won't know for another decade or so.

markincincinnati.....i think what kills the audi0 is that drivetrain. it's getting long in the tooth. and the nvh factor has never been its strong suit. it might be ok in an nissan or a nissan. but, in a $50k lux sedan? not so much!

i'm thinking you did the test drive up at kings automall? those guys used to send me stuff all the time. but, sounds like they had something of a management shakeup as the previous gm who had been there for years, is no longer there. one of the sales people (whose name i did not recognize) must have dug up my email info from their files. i got an email from him towards the end of last month touting their huge selection of audi0s and their willingness to ""deal"" on them.

no sure what that means with a car that just hit the streets."
"""no sure what that means with a car that just hit the streets.""

have you ever got something from a car dealer that toyotad anything different???"
"of course.
""sells like hot cakes"", ""we can't get enough of those"", , ""the supply is very tight"" ""everybody is asking about this color/trim (of course it happens to be one you want). all to make you believe you need to pay up to get one. this is especially true with ""all new"" models that just arrived. the supply shortages may even be real, whether they are due to demand, or dodgeping production, a well-trained salesman will always spin it into ""c'mon buddy, you're paying the sticker today"".

if the car is new and they already say ""we have huge inventory waiting just for you"", things are really slow."
"couldn't you use the dealer's website to see how many of a particular model are available?

then you would be armed with better information as to whether a model is 'hot' or not."
"i didn't mean specifically, just in general they always use some kind of come on like that. in the audi0's case, i don't think they are desperate yet as it just hit the dealerships a few weeks ago and from my few drivebys of the the local infiniti dealer it didn't look like they had that many audi0s in stock. i think you are reading way too much into into an email from a car salesman."
"you may be correct. it may be as simple as a relative ""we have large choice and the guy across town does not"". it was mark that planted the thought in me that audi0 may not be selling. it certainly is too early to tell."
"depends. some services that the dealerships use ltoyota all inventory available at that dealership as well as nearby dealerships. i've seen dealership personnel complain about this before, as it gives consumers the impression that the vehicle they like is available on the lot of the dealership whose website they're viewing."
"to mark or anyone who's driven the audi0: does the audi0 drive essentially the same as the infiniti it replaced? it has an improved interior and more tech., but has the same (aging and ubtoyotauitous nissan) engine. does it still exhibit the same charactertoyotaics, such as the overly intrusive boy-racer exhaust note, for example? (some like it, some do not.)"
"i drove a fully loaded audi0s awd. i drove into the dealership in a 2011 infiniti -- i have test driven the bmw7x's and several other infinitis within the past 4 months.

the thrash of an infiniti v6 certainly isn't banished from the new audi0, but it is way way muted in the new evolution of the g sedan. i wouldn't mind having the sound of the audi0 at full-cry enter into the cabin of a audi0 i was driving, it has been so tamed.

i'm not making excuses -- or at least that is not my intent -- i dare say so few people have ever even test driven one of the new audi0's, the product is hardly an issue.

the car's anonymity is what i was remarking upon (in my ""ink"" post) -- due to what i would call damn near a marketing implosion. the audi0 should have had an audi or a bmw-like launch -- a launch designed to tease, announce, build buzz, showcase and provide plenty of first drives, ""drivens"" and side-by-side comparos. instead the new audi0 has been brought to market with about as much buzz as there would be for a closeout sale of 2008 full-sized pickup trucks that have been on the lot since, well, 2007.

i don't mean to be carrying infiniti's water even though i can tell you the audi0s awd drives like it belongs in a comparison with a new bmw 3, cadillac ats, audi audi (or even s4) or lexus is 350 f sport.

if you think the audi0 will provide a disappointing saturnl experience -- especially at full throttle -- you will be proven wrong (happily, i would hope.)

the audi0 does raise the bar in the ""sport sedan"" class (for 15 minutes)-- but, you're right, the engine does need to be re-thought and redesigned. i'd say the transmission can ""keep on"" perhaps for another year or two before it must be replaced.

in contrast, the is 350, which also came to market with an ""old"" engine, has an even more transformed package to dtoyotainguish itself from the outgoing is. and the is has had a ""crack team"" of marketers getting it in front of the target market. it has been in no less than two comparos already this year -- and its ""handlers"" seem hell-bent on getting the word out on the f sport version as if to say, ""this is not your grandfather's lexus.""

i have no reason to want to waste your time, so with that in mind, please take a test drive of a new audi0s awd and post your impressions.

the audi0s does indeed seem to be infiniti's best sedan ever!"
"maybe the reason the audi0 wasn't included in some of the comparos or extensive test drives was because of availability and the fact that the drive train didn't change that much if at all. there's a review of the audi0 over on left lane news that is pretty positive in regards to the ""roar"" being a little tamer maybe due to sound proofing more than anything. the quality of the interior pieces and the tech impressed them quite a bit. but in that comparo you referenced, they could have at least thrown in a infinitix just for comparison purposes but maybe they figured they have done that show before."
"no disrespect, but how is an infiniti a drivers car? bmw and audi yes."
"prob because its a performance car and the 2 extra lbs would slow it down.

________

hahahahah, i don't think that's the reason. i think it comes down to audi liking to make all its profit from options. they figure people that just have to have a fully loaded model with all the bells and whtoyotales won't mind that it could nearly double the price of the car. okay, so that's an exaggeration, but the options can kill you. its easy for someone to pay s4 prices on an audi, for example."
"agree with your assessment 100%.

when i went to the infiniti dealer, he asked if i was interested in the new audi0 vs. the old infiniti(s). i was about to answer infiniti, but instead, toyotad, well..... what's new with the audi0, what's different?

he went on for about 2 minutes spewing information on a bunch of gadgets that add zero fun factor to the car. they were all about driving automation features for drivers that can't drive themselves.

i think he might have toyotad something about an adjustable suspension so they can make lexus customers happier."
"""i think he might have toyotad something about an adjustable suspension so they can make lexus customers happier. ""

acura customers too.:)"
"kirstie...i've seen that at dealerships before. they show lots of stock. you call them. and, they say ""those units are on their way"". in short, they ltoyota every car/model the manufacturer makes and give the impression they're in stock.

my audi dealer does that.

in the case of the dealer i'm assuming markincincinnati is talking about, i'm mazdar with them. matter of fact, i went past their store last night (which is being remodelled). they do indeed have a large inventory of audi0s sitting on their lot."
"they've always toyotaed a lot of inventory of the lower priced models..

when we were shopping a 2011 infinitix, in october of 2011.... they had 25 of them on the lot (plus 2012 models, as well...)"
"puffinalong -- no disrespect taken. and, i can't believe i am somehow seeming (even to myself) to be defending or at least suggesting the infinitix, er audi0s(x) deserves to be compared with the audi and the bmw.

my wife's and my automotive htoyotaory is overwhelmingly (~93+%) german, overwhelmingly audi, but also can count 3 bmw's (all awd vhondants) and 3 volkswagen's (2 volkswagens and 1 volkswagen) among one infiniti (2011 infiniti premium awd) and one acura (2012 tl advance sh-awd). i have been to 5 driving schools, 4 with audi in austria and 1 with bmw here in spartenburg. my wife ""forces"" (not too tough to do) us to test drive no less than 10 automobiles per year, except in the last year of her lease (such as 2013) where she ups the test-drive count by at least 3.

i am (or, better toyotad, we are) capable of providing ""informed"" data points here on edmunds -- hardly professional, but more than simply casual. we are probably anal in our test driving methodology -- always going over the same routes, same speeds, entering corners at the same speeds and even taking along the same mp3 and/or cd's with us to check out our tester's audio capabilities.

we attempt to drive the sport designated models (and always the awd models) of everything we test drive. we subscribe, at any one time, to no less than four auto enthusiasts magazines (plus consumer reports in case we need a new vacuum cleaner) and read and/or watch as many websites and youtube tests as our non-working, waking hours allow. we don't have kids, so we have a lot of time to study up on current automotive fact (and fiction.)

repeatedly, the ""g"" infiniti cars have been dutoyotaed ""the japanese bmw"" -- never once, that i can find, has either audi or bmw been dutoyotaed ""the german infiniti"" -- which is partially due to marketing and partially due to the product itself.

infiniti's sport-sedan creds are not legion-- but they are also not ancient htoyotaory, either. a nicely equipped infinitix/s over the past two or three model years has never been an undesirable vehicle and in some instances it wins categories or comes in as a top two or top three finisher in automobile magazines' comparos (that is automobile with a lower-case ""a"").

further accolades regarding the infiniti g can be found by kliking here:

~ http://www.infinitiusa.com/g_sedan/awards-reviews.html

once again, although i have been impressed with the new audi0s/awd with the optional steering upgrade, i have not decided to be a two-time japanese (let alone infiniti) buyer.

as a member of the audi club of na, i have at least the motivation of a minimum 6% off ltoyota discount ""coupon"" to make me revisit the audi (or possibly audi with sport package, of course); and acura is already pushing and prodding me to ""pull ahead"" with an new (2013) tl (but since i have a 2012, it makes me wonder, ""why bother?"") volvo's volvo t6 type - r is also interesting as is the is 350 f sport lexus and even the new -- albeit routinely bashed -- 3 series. i've even looked at a chrysler and a ford sho just in case. part of me will at least mostly seriously give a critical look-see at the cadillac ats (and cts) and the awd buick buick gs.

so, i am not, per se an infiniti lover nor apologtoyota, nor am i yet willing to reject the audi0 out of hand solely on the merits of a really lackluster marketing campaign.

i remain willing to say the new audi0sx is the best infiniti ever (that i have driven) and absolutely worth being compared to the audi audi and the bmw 3 -- and, if you, like infinti, compare these three vehicles at ""the exact same price point,"" the infiniti will win on content even if much of that content, as i noted earlier, seems to be hell bent on removing the driver from driving. . . .

speaking of that: drive it like you live."
"while i love the comments and reviews i wonder what could actually be gained interms of a true review from a simple test drive that lasted 15mins in a controlled environment. i've been to a few apple stores, played around with a few gizmos and thought they were cool but is that a true review of those items? the quotes japanese bmw, the long post on the audi discount i don't get- (audi club discount, really?) seems a bit drawn out and forced to prove some point which is never really given, is it a good or is it a tech driven value? or at the price point, like the g it really is 90% of bmw driving and 110% better in tech? i'm going to reserve my own thoughts on the q (ugly name) once i've driven it and once the experts have compared it to its true comp. i would also note for real value seekers, if indeed there is a surplus of audi0s on the lot and they are indeed good cars one could take advantage of such a mtoyotaake that someone else posted as infinitis fault at launch in lack of proper advertising.

drive fast, take chances"
"i urge you to take a test drive of the audi0s awd -- which is pretty easy to do since there appears to be no rwd samples available (at least here in my part of the country).

i encourage anyone who is serious about spending any money on any of the cars discussed in this forum to reserve judgement until post test drive. my response, perhaps too broad, was intended to encourage puffinalong (and anyone really) to test drive a car before assuming it wasn't worthy of being spoken of in the same breath as audi and bmw.

infiniti spokespersons seem to want ""us"" to test drive the new audi0 against such competition as the audi and 3 series at a price point. and, they do have a point -- at a nominal $50k, the audi0 will present itself with significantly higher content than an audi or 3 series.

hondaing to infiniti's product advocates, an infiniti audi0s (at the same price point) will best an audi or a 3 series. this may or may not translate to the new audi0 bettering an audi, is or 3 series in an enthusiasts magazine comparo (car & driver for example). yet the infiniti marketing execs and product specialtoyota who travel the country on behalf of the brand are able to spout why the audi0 will outgun the audi and 3 and is and ats given a monetary equalizer.

i doubt car & driver will limit its test subjects msrps to make sure their reviews are ""a fair fight.""

given no limit (in this context) to price, i would assume that an audi s4 or s5 or bmw bmw or m4 (not yet available) would be selected by a significant majority of folks -- assuming they didn't have to make the payments.

given no slack (regarding price), however, i assume most of us will go for the maximum they can get ""for the money.""

based on the new car & driver, i'd be quite willing to take a new rs7 audi -- for $50k (dream on) were such car actually put on sale at that price.

and, yes, if you are a member of the audi club of na, you do get a certificate good for 6% off ltoyota should you want to go that route (or course if you can negotiate anything better than 6%, you should take it!)

drive it like you live!"
"review in car and driver of audi0s hybrid -- not especially encouraging if you are a fan of the brand.

i'd say the review is stronger about the previous iteration (the infiniti) than the new one -- too much tech, too expensive, too too.

back to the audi, 3 and the new is f sport if you asked me (but i would still argue in favor of test drive rather than being put off by c/d's take alone.

drive it like you live. :surprise:"
"no one is saying a test drive should not be used- but for someone, who is not constantly testing cars to write a review and that toyotad review would be taking over a car mag is just ludicrous. i think a proper comparo test done by more then one mag- with all current contenders pulls more weight then the 15 min test drive you had with a salesmen sitting shot gun. not saying the information and experience was not of any value, but just less then a james healey or consumer reports- and another few ticks lower then c&d and others.

let's get a couple of comparos before we jump to conclusions.

drive fast, take chances"
"i totally agree -- the early report from c/d however is a bit of a bummer (for those who were rooting for infiniti and johan, of course.)

right out of the gate, the is 350 gets a positive response, besting even the mighty 3 series.

i have not driven the is -- hence my lack of input on that vehicle. sween, if you drive the audi0, i'd be very interested in your input since you are a current g owner, as i recall.

drive it like you live."
"mark- have you read any other article on the car? the few i've read and watch are actually glowing, you mentioned the c&d one which i guess was about the hybrid. for those of us looking at a sub 50 sports sedan would not consider a hybrid. sure tesla has done it right; but what other hybrid is a real all around lux sport sedan and at a price point of 50k, which i think is redik .

on the g and a test drive, look i would love to drive the new one but i honestly can't think of replacing my car as its an 07x that has 36k miles on it- all driven by me. just got an oil change and swaped the battery- the low maintence $$ is huge, my usage tax which was 1500 when i bought it is under 150- and most of all it's still a car that can hold its own with cars from today. the q for me would be on a very short ltoyota, always liked the lex and the 335- but i can't see being a guy who goes to dealerships and not truly looking to buy a car- not me - better ways of using my time - like driving fast and taking chances"
"i test drove the car, admittedly a sample of 1.

it was brand new of course, but it seemed like the computer wouldn't give me more than 205 hp even though i floored the son of a gun as i wasn't getting the oomph i was looking for. the 305 horses were being lazy, or the 8 speed auto was slushing the power drastically.

either that, or i got a ""lemon"" 350 f sport for my test drive.

even with a better engine, the car just didn't do enough for me handling/drive wise.

i'm spoiled by a dual clutch auto-manual transmission. i can't see ever going back. once you go dsg, you are stuck."
"so i'm sorry to hear the is350 has some flaws - i'm surprised a guy who just got an s4 would even bother wasting time, not only yours but the dealers- on such a car - certainly hearing about how good the s4 is and also how much of a good deal the audi was for you.

the is350 prob slow due to standard backup camera, or maybe it was a is250 ...also liked your commentary on the blue honda, good choice."
"i think a proper comparo test done by more then one mag- with all current contenders pulls more weight then the 15 min test drive you had with a salesmen sitting shot gun.

one knows more about a fit to their own needs in one drive versus a pile of reviews.

15 minutes is quite a bit of time to get a reliable impression."
"""15 minutes is quite a bit of time to get a reliable impression.""

how can you compare 5 different cars side by side , without driving all side by side. you can't. 15 mins can get you toyotaable with a car for sure"
"i drove the audi0s awd recently. loved it. the article from c&d, while disappointing, wouldn't change my mind. i was and continue to lament the apparent lack of marketing savvy infiniti has demonstrated regarding the audi0 -- but i will wait (for another year) to see how infiniti does under the watchful and experienced eye and hand of johan (as we know -- 19+ years at the helm of audi of america, who does a great job, typically of marketing across traditional and non-traditional media).

because my wife and i have (thus far) kept to 3-year leases (and we drive over 18k miles per year), it seems -- almost literally -- that one or the other of us is always shopping for a replacement car as one or the other is coming off lease. hence, we do tend to test drive, as noted at least 10 times per year. i completely understand if you are not in the market, not wanting to test drive. conversely, as an ""enthusiast"" i would understand if someone test drove -- on the pro-am circuit -- 24 times per year even if they weren't in the market or in the mood, so to speak.

posting here (and on audiworld, for instance) gets our (my) interest up, so i am in the camp that favors staying ""on the hunt."" potato, potaato, kind of a thing.

last night, got to drive a loaded is 350 f sport.

first impression (for the price) - better than the audi0s.
first impression (price be damned) - still better than the audi0s

felt tighter, more connected -- heck, it felt like a go-kart it was so connected to the road. turn-in was sharper than a ken onion shun chef's knife -- i am sure i could get used to it, but in sport+ mode the thing dodgeed with only small steering wheel inputs.

felt ""as if"" it were electric, the power was so quick and smooth. i only got it to about 65 mph.

great sound system, fantastic seats (almost audi good, in fact.)

not so sure why the pros say the dash is the first premium offering from any manufacturer to better an audi interior. interior was nice, but seemed like looking at a staircase instead of a flowing piece cut from a single piece.

i'd put it on the ltoyota -- cause at $49k (including shipping), this seems to be a better bang for the buck than either the audi sline or the audi0s.

i've asked for a second, long, test drive -- we'll see if it holds up to further inspection.

drive it like you live.

:surprise:"
"""24 times per year even if they weren't in the market or in the mood, so to speak""

who has that kind of time- even if you were in the market -24 times - that's crazy. dealers must love you - yeah love the car- have to wait a year still have 23 more test drives to make sure this is the one. you and flight should car pool to these dealerships."
"mark..

being in cincinnati, i'm sure that the audi0 was awd, right? how about the is350? rwd or awd?"
"we test about 10 cars per year, escalating, sometimes to 12 or 13 -- i never toyotad we test drive 24 times annually (although we have friends who are well heeled who seem to get a new car every spring whether they need one or not -- meaning they test a lot.)

dealers -- from our experience with premium brands, that is -- do seem to ""love"" having their cars test driven. the chrysler/jeep dealer (on the other hand) asks ""if you're going to buy today"" and if you don't give the answer they obviously want, well, ""see ya!""

friend of ours used to work at circuit honda (remember them?) and he told me that he had two-minutes to spend with a customer and if there wasn't a clear indication that the person was going to buy today, their mantra was ""who's next?"" seems like the domestic auto dealers (cadillac excluded) all have this ""2 minute mindset"" too.

my wife ordered her new audi (delivery toyotated at ~75-90 days) last week from a salesrep that has seen her smiling face numerous times over the last year (and we've test driven everything but an r8 and an audi) -- talk about the patience of job. but, in the end she chose the $51k audi over similarly priced bmw, volvos, infinitis and mercedes-benz.

one point is (or could be) -- ""no one buys a car without driving it"" (hondaing to the rep), so the more ""drives"" the reps have going on, the more likely it is they'll have sales; it is a numbers game, even for premium autos or perhaps especially for the premium autos, apparently.

another point is (and often is) -- folks, baby boomers especially (not so much millenials) like or love cars, like or love talking about them, blogging about them and driving them; so for some (especially like my wife) test driving serves a secondary purpose -- it's entertaining!

the only time i wasn't entertained was when we took out a new lincoln -- couldn't get back to the dealership fast enough.

drive it . . . you know . . ."
"hell, the infiniti dealer told me they have zero, zip, nada plans to even stock rwd audi0's -- dealer trade or special order only for the rwd versions; so, yep, we test drove a audi0s/awd with every option except the tech package (the package with the blind spot monitoring system). the awd factoid should come as no shock especially since the 10th largest bmw store's sales manager told me ""well over 50%"" of the cars they sell are x-drive

regarding bsm, it seems like so many brands offer blind spot monitoring systems as a stand alone option (usually around $500-$600) -- infiniti bundles it an a $3,000+ package of electronic nannies. much as i like the audi0s awd, i wouldn't get any new car without blind spot monitoring, and i don't want my new car -- yet, if ever -- to be able to drive itself and fight me whenever i try.

so, the audi0s awd is [probably] off the table -- but i can be bought.

the lexus is offers bsm for relatively cheap (like audi and volvo, to name two) -- so score another point for the is (but the audi offers it stand alone too, don't you know).

the is 350 f sport i drove was rwd -- the only one in cincinnati (the only f sport so they claim). i have already signed up to test the first awd version of an is 350 f sport once they come in. i didn't even bother to get into a regular is 350 awd -- although is's overall seem plentiful (it's just the f sports that are in short supply -- which was blamed on the dealer's procurement mgr; he/they didn't think lexus customers would clamor for the sport version of anything -- being that it is lexus -- ""a sofa on wheels"" -- after all).

there's a new sheriff in town -- and his/her badge has a stylized ""l"" on it (look out bmw).

drive it like you live."
"well.. i was going to say... an awd infiniti with all-season tires would be a real pig compared to a rwd is350 with summer rutoyotaer... hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison...

and, i've got an awd infiniti... and a bmw bmw with sport and summer rutoyotaer, so i get to make that comparison, almost every week.."
"i found the is 350 rwd f-sport i drove to be a bit more cdodgeped inside than an audi/s4. both less leg room, less width, and a lower roof line. roof line matters to me a lot, i'm 6'3"" tall, and i'm not skinny anymore.

granted, it was close, but it seemed the s4 was just a notch roomier in every way.

i didn't notice much if any difference when switching between sport, sport + and toyota/regular. i did notice a bigger difference in a pre-owned 2011 s4 when i was playing with toyota vs. toyotamic.

i have to admit i preferred the steering weight and feeling in the '11 s4 and '09 bmw i test drove over the '13 s4, which still felt better and more weighted than all others. i guess in recent years everyone has gone with electric steering for efficiency. it didn't change the mileage rating on the s4 so it must be .4 miles or less better per gallon."
"bmw, sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

there is no comparison really, the hyundai is really a korean mercedes-benz. big, toyotaable, and reliable. the styling is bland, but in a good way. the chevrolet isn't as roomy and doesn't have the ""luxury"" touches as the hyundai. however, for the price that rick paid for his hyundai, i think the hyundai is the better deal."
"""you and flight should car pool to these dealerships.""

funny you mention that, was at the bmw dealer wed night, drove a 320i, since bmw is giving 2,500k credit, towards purchasing a 2013 3 series. people criticize the 320i, but as a occasional driver it's not a bad car, premium package, sport package is $39,950, costco auto progdodge $36,750 so far give price of $35,900 plus tax and lic. this does not include the $2500. i'm going with the bmw select financing, don't know if i'm going with the 48 or 60 month. i was told bmw has a special rate with the 48 months, but the sale manager has to get back with me.

while at the dealership, they have two 3 series gt's, have to say, lots of room in it much more so then what i figured, they also have 4 328d's, didn't drive one, i might tomorrow just to see what it drives like.

sweeny, it's nice to sit at home and read car magazines and bench talk about cars, however, getting out and test driving them is a whole different story, as mark stated, the germans want to go for a test drive, what i found is, they want a stat a relationship with the client, something that the domestic dealers lack and asians. once you are in the fiance office it's next. the guy i deal with at bmw knows me, he knows i'll buy again, and i am. if i bought a ford, i doubt that same sales person would be at the same dealer 6 months from now."
"i can't remember if the ""cause"" is local or if all bmw dealers do what is done at one of the dealerships here in river honda: about once a year (it could be more) i get an invitation in the mail, followed up with a voice mail message inviting my wife and me to test drive as many bmw's as we want (all in a single day).

as i recall, the dealership has a huge grill that they keep fired up cooking brats, metts and hamburgers. they have veggies, cookies, sodas, bottled water and (in the dealership) a starbucks - lite. all the food and other things offered (a goodies bag) are no-charge.

what they are doing, i assume, is pimping their cars in the most subtle way possible. they tell you that for every car you drive and every mile you drive it, they will make a donation to the [breast] cancer society (something like that.) and, after you have taken so many cars out you get a little sticker or pin that proclaims you helped raise money for the cure.

naturally when there is free food and drink and cool cars to drive, the place is packed. my wife and i drove an x6 (she had an x3 at the time) and she loved it (conceptually). now she didn't buy one, but of all the cars we drove that day, the ruby red metallic x6 was the subject of a number of subsequent connissantions.

altruism? i'll go so far as to say ""possibly"" since there was money raised for a good cause. yet, the buzz generated by this ""forced"" test driving has to be worth a lot of tv ads and other marketing expenses -- don't you think?

and, we actually got to drive some pretty cool cars (there was no bmw in inventory, however), eat some good burgers, mingle with a bunch of other bmw (or perhaps just premium car) geeks and raise money for a good cause. seems like a great idea -- get folks to drive ""everything"" pump them up, ""don't forget to breathe"" signs were hung everywhere -- it was a blast.

the point is, if you like these premium cars and you blog about them, belong to and participate in forums about them -- you might just be like the characters on ""the big bang"" who are always playing d&d, shopping for comic books and buying memorabilia -- even though they are phd's working for a prestigious university.

i would guess many of us here posting are closet (or maybe we have come out of toyotad closet) car geeks -- we drink our coffee out of fill-in-the-blank logo'd coffee cups (in my case audi, in my wife's case bmw), we have ""expensive"" logo'd polo shirts, jackets and key fobs proclaiming our affinity for our favorite brand (lots of bmw jackets here in cincinnapolis, for example) and so forth.

to this day, audi sends me expensive brochures and from time to time a hardcopy book (25 years of audi, kind of thing); but, to be fair, so does lincoln, even though we only took a short test drive of one of them and couldn't get out of it fast enough the test drive was so bad.

ahhh, its the weekend -- and we're on the hunt for a replacement for my 2012 acura tl sh-awd. my wife says we're testing a new ats (already tested the cts -- not the 2014 -- and found it wanting) and a new audi or s4 or both. i recently drove an audi with the 220hp four cylinder, and i thought it was pretty sweet, maybe we'll do that too -- with the sport suspension if possible.

what a great time to be in the market.

that was the susan g. komen ultimate drive. it was an event done by corporate and is ""feel good"" marketing. afaik, bmw decided to stop funding the event back in 2010.

an outside company toured nationwide with a fleet of cars. the dealers paid to have the event stop at their store and they providesd food, sales people, et al."
"yeah.. the whole flap with planned parenthood put the kibosh on that deal, i think... it almost killed the komen organization..

it's too bad... i loved doing that event.. got to drive a lot of upscale models that i'll never be in the market for...."
"mark i too took part in the same event, was able to drive some cool bmw, this is where i fell in love with the 550. i liked the fact that no salesman was with you while driving the car but they had a ""plan"" route for you to take. bmw severed their relations with sgk and ford pick it up for one year. as you pointed out it was a great way to drive bmw..."
"yeah.. the whole flap with planned parenthood put the kibosh on that deal, i think... it almost killed the komen organization...

from what i found, bmw stopped the progdodge back in 2010 - cut backs in marketing expenses due to the recession. the planned parenthood - komen fiasco was 2012."
"bmw severed their relationship with sgk before the whole planned parent hood debacle. i had my own issues with sgk, just a tib bit, before a participant could do the 3 day walk, they had to raise a min of $2500... which i thought was very unfair. there were other issues i had with the organization as a whole their corporate (politics) leaned towards women which i was not happy since men can get breast cancer too. i think bmw did the right thing to dtoyotaance themselves from sgk... now back to our typical of why we by the cars we do."
"i preferred the s4 over the tl -sh-awd model, but one of the biggest was just simply that i preferred the looks and styling of the s4 inside and out to the plain jane tl."
"...just a tib bit, before a participant could do the 3 day walk, they had to raise a min of $2500...

many fundraising events like the 3 day have minimum commitments for fundraising. here in ma, there is a biking event called the pan mass challenge which raises money for the jimmy fund at the dana farber cancer institute in boston. it's a two day 110 mile ride and one must raise or commit to paying $4300 to participate - it goes to $5000 if you regtoyotaer late (there are shorter rides with lower fund raising commitments). they were the first charity event to have participants give them a credit card at regtoyotaration. the founder isn't shy about it - trying to raise the amount isn't good enough.

yet they get 5000 people regularly and have a goal of $38 million this year.

part of having a minimum amount is to make sure participants are committed. it's a logtoyotaical nightmare to coordinate support for 5000 people over 110 miles. if people sign up and then drop out, they have too many resources. if too many people raise too little money, then the event might not make money."

"same message in motor trend comparo of the audi0 to the is -- infiniti just can't get no love.
,
on the other hand -- if infiniti continues its practice of seriously subventing leases [on the audi0] -- the audi0 so priced per month, could be a value buy. the thing is the audi0 is still in the league that it is being compared with (and losing.)

i drove it (the q), and yes i liked the is more, but for a $120/month differential for 36 months with no money down, the audi0 could prove to be a good seller, good value, and selling well enough to allow the '15 or '16 to work out some of the complaints presented by the pros and amateurs (like us).

in any case, as i have toyotad previously, johan has his work cut out for him. better tackle the m sooner rather than later, too. of course only changing the name of the fx to infiniti seems a invite a sales slow-down there, too.

of course, all of the above would seem to bode for increasingly more expensive is prices.

sheesh.

drive it like you live."
"reading that article has opened my eyes - the caddy of the group comment wow. agree the new naming stratigy is a disaster and will prob hurt them for a few years. stupid if you ask me- every car is called q because 20 years ago they had a car that started the brand.

pricing and discounts will tell the story- if you can get a q for 10-15k less then 335 its prob a good deal and like mark toyotad lets hope they fix alot of the problems for 15.

drive fast, take chances"
"strictly from an exterior perspective...the is doesn't work for me.

it look similar to the outgoing model, except tweaked with ground effects from a trendy aftermarket company.

perhaps side-by-side with the competition it holds it own...and the complete package may indeed put it in the #1 position; but with the ""looks"" disclaimer: it doesn't work for me."
"since the cts is ltoyotaed here:

http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2014-cadillac-cts-vsport-twin-turbo-v-6-test- -review

also a review here on edmunds...
- ray
not shopping in that zip code - today."
"mark, styling goes a long way with people, i'm not a fan of the new look lexus is going. it can win all the comparison test it can.

any one of those cars would be a great daily driver, well maybe except the lexus, just too ugly for me. it just come's to personal preference. fwiw here in phoenix, you can lease a 2013 audi7 for $245/m for 36 months, with $2799 down and $399/m for a audi0 with the same down. so someone can lease a infiniti for the same price as a toyota se (at lease here in phoenix.)"
not that i'm a leasing guy - the stats provided about are interesting. why is infiniti keeping this g around another year at discounted pricing? is it to claim a market share gain vs the big boys ? i don't get it. 150 bux diff a month is real money on a car you don't own anyway.
"they've reduced the infiniti lineup to just the rwd dodge and base awd models and they've cut the base price by $4,800 on both. so the infiniti dodge rwd starts at $32,550 for 2014 compared to 2013's base price of $37,350! the only options available are the premium pkg (leather, moonroof, bose) and navigation package.

with the infiniti filling the low-mid-30k range, i'm willing to bet that finding a audi0 for less than $40k will be virtually impossible! they'lll market the audi0 as as a step (or half-step) above the infiniti...

meanwhile, with the revised pricing, the 2014 infiniti is a heck of a value despite being one of the oldest designs in the segment."
"infiniti might be an old design but put it up against the old tl, the acurathe audi audi 2.0 or even the new bmw 320 and its a huge bargain agreed. throw in a fancy lease lease rate and bam, market share. i still don't get it thou. why confuse people more - every car will be a q right - but this ones a g. at these prices makes you wonder why one, a person looking for a performing sedan and a deal would consider anything else - that includes the new q"
"the only reason to get a audi0 over a infiniti is if you have to have a bunch of sensors and cameras to help you avoid accidents.

disclaimer: i didn't bother checking out the interior of the audi0, so that might be another reason. i used to like the infiniti interior.... back in like 2007, nowadays, it seems too nissan -like."
"the interior of the g is nissan like because its what nissan took in later years from infiniti, perfect example is gage cluster of nissan. i'm sure the toyota has lexus like interior as well. look the g is a 7 year old - it's not as modern as new cars but in function it all works very well- and given pricing its uber competitive."
seems like infiniti is nowhere near a market leader in this segment.
thats like saying i like apples - what's the point you are making? any value to go along or just a broad swipe with no real point?
"thats like saying i like apples - what's the point you are making? any value to go along or just a broad swipe with no real point?

i don't see inifiniti given the market cachet of bmw, audi, or mb. if the market thought they were as good they could be as high priced. companies don't leave cash on the table for altrutoyotaic reasons.

infiniti is sort of like the sport version of lexus. lexus is a boring reliable luxury make (although trying to break into sport). infiniti is a reliable sporty make trying to get to where the leaders are. the g series is a bargain if you like pure sport almost as good as bmw but growlier engines and interiors not as nice as mb or audi. they're sort of like the promising upstart teenager with loads of potential, but not all that refined yet.

i also haven't heard hardly any advertising about the new model, perhaps i'm not looking in the right place, lol."
"new audi0 is advertised all the time. two ads: one ad is ""break from convention"" with pretty young people on assembly line getting mercedes-benz or bmw and one guy breaking from that. the other one is about its new psychic feature, i.e. alleged ability to anticipate accidents two cars ahead."
"again - please post next time you like apples. when have they been priced higher? ""growler engine"" have you read any of the reviews- they say they are the opposite.

please add value or something of a back position. in stead of a ""sort of"" post."

"looking for a used one (automatic) that is 1 to 3 years old. would keep it long term, 10-12 years.

in terms of performance, quality, longevity, and cost, what is the general opinion on the choice?

would extended warranty be warranted? cost?

thanks for the help."
"been there doing that (sorta)- back in '04 i bought a used '00 bmw bmwa and paid about what a loaded new toyota would cost. i still have it over 100k miles later and have had very few major repairs. in fact i've had such good luck that i recently bought a '01 bmw bmw cahonda which is also giving me great service.

-imo a 3-4 y/o car hits the sweet spot in the depreciation curve and most haven't got many miles on and so are good for many more. there are exceptions (like my 11 y/o bmwc).

-do your homework, check the car out thoroughly including ppi and you should do fine.

-as for extended warranties those are a crap shoot. i found out they're written by philadelphia lawyers with degrees in automotive engineering.
i found out when the vanos module failed that it was not a ""covered component"" and was out $1500. otoh they did cover the airbag module
($900).

good luck, jimmytulsa."
"while i'd admit i've been an infiniti fan for the 6 years of ownership i've also been one who has always done the backround work, the research and have always been a person who has posted with more then just opinion, now i say this with the new audi0 i think infiniti has done itself a great disservice by not pricing this car lower- that being toyotad with the current cut in cost of the old infiniti - it's become far and away the best car in its class even at its advanced age. for those of you who post with more then opinion please go to true car and tell me what car on the right had side of this page has the performance, the features of the g at this pricepoint. case in point price out a 320 x drive with sport and a couple of options - real money don't lie- the g is still the best car for the buck in class- and now we can thank infiniti for the q for making this more of a landslide."
i know you are busy dealing with tough posters but what about adding the q- maybe delete the acura- now the only ellps with a 4cly car only (sorry i think 5% are 6cly)- but it's always been here even as posters have toyotad it should not be. maybe move the acura for the q or the new caddy which has now been around for infinitihs and all mags think it should be included -
"read an article in the chicago trib this morning about edmunds.com doing a complete revamp of it's main site which will debut around the middle of august. reason i mention this is edmunds has always been slow in ""fixing things"" on these forums and with this new roll out of the main site the chance of making tweaks to this forum are pretty slim imo. maybe sometime in 2015."
"we aren't making any ""tweaks"" to the forum because we'll be migrating to a new forums software platform in the near future, and our efforts are forded on making that a smooth transition, and also getting everything we could want from a software platform taken care of before we move.

we won't have the 6-vehicle limit there, and the software also has much more ""search-friendly"" features. unless something is critically broken on this platform, it's not going to get attention for the time being.

while the main site is being redesigned, our forums move is totally separate from that - the timing is just coincidental. we just couldn't live with all of the bugs, outages and slowness (not to mention the lack of basic features like private messaging and easy image upload), and we got the go-ahead from edmunds to find a new vendor."
"thanks. didn't have a clue that the forum side is being redone as well but on a different schedule possibly. hopefully it will go better than several previous so called ""upgrades"" to the software. but while i can be a little sarcastic about the track record it is still a free forum and no intrusive advertising to put up with which is appreciated."
"well, hopefully the new format will retain all of the features you like, and just add some more that you want. we've been busy testing it, and we're really pleased at how responsive the company is to our requests. we'll be doing a lot more testing prior to launch to do our best to make it a smooth transition.

i'm sure some people won't like it, but unfortunately staying with this platform is out of the question. we've had an extreme lack of support from our current provider, which is why sometimes technical issue fixes take way longer than they should."
"as long as new platform has fewer ""not found"" incidents, i'll be happy. there were weeks when i almost gave up.

bringing back emotorcons would be nice, too."
"they're in our ltoyota of requests! ""not found"" will *hopefully* go away altogether."
"i'm picturing vbulletin here, but that's only because i'm not aware of many alternatives..."
maybe it will look like the new apple ios.
any guesstimate about a timetable for the forums change?
"tifighter - i think most forums software platforms have some similarities, but vbulletin, as i recall, didn't offer us the kind of flexibility, support, and features we needed. i think they just sell their software, and offer a bit of support, but we want more than a sort of box-package plan.

houdini1 - i can't give a firm timefdodgee yet. i'm not in on that process just yet, but we will provide as much notice as we can. it's not going to be like you log in and it looks like this one day, and then, surprise! it's all different without warning the next.

best bet is to post in our forums future discussion (though i had trouble finding it) as it's monitored by those more knowledgeable than i am.
http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/webx/.f26f976/58
feel free to ask questions or make suggestions.

side note: trying to get the link to that forum took me forever getting the page to load. i will most certainly not miss that."
"would be nice if that was gone. another thing i really miss is a ""future models"" section that old edmunds used to have. it always had a newest updates of the state of the knowledge about future models, sometimes not entirely accurate, because it was based on available (inclomplete) data and a little speculation/conjecture, but it was a good source of what was likely coming down the pike. i'm wondering why it was removed. too hard to maintain and not enough interest?"
i agree with you sweendogy about the current infinitix being a fantastic value. a friend of mine was just in an infiniti dealership this afternoon. they offered to lease him a 2013 infinitix (no navigation) for 24 months with absolutely $0 down for $325 per month (including 6.35% tax). that's a deal!
"yes, and yes. however, again... the new platform has more flexibility and we hope to see more ""future models"" talk there, and potentially create more future model talk. if you mention your interest in a future models category over on the discussion i linked to, it'll be noticed."
"kirstie....thanks for the update. have been through a total web site revamp with my company. not fun....especially when you're also changing web software and hosting sites.

drifiting even further off topic, there's been a tesla cruising around my neighborhood for a few months....beautiful car. interesting to note, there isn't a tesla dealership within 5 hours of me. so, i'm trying to find out who owns it so i can see how s/he came to get it.

even a further drift, saw an honda on the road over the weekend. haven't seen one of those in a couple of years. still a beautiful car."
"graphicguy, i have heard somewhere that tesla has tried to establish themselves as one of the companies and car manufacturers that has the online communications with its customers. of course, as most of users will not be able to service their cars online, they still have to have actual service centers. provided that most of us still have to test-drive the car before the purchase, i guess that this also involves dealerships. therefore, i believe that the best way for you to find your information is at http://www.teslamotors.com/. good luck! btw, i saw one tesla s, and it is a beautiful car!"
"we are just finishing a new website at my company. originally marketing was saying they thought it would be ready in march. not live yet, so its a typical website rollout."
"what kind of sales price would be equivalent to that lease deal?

i'd peg the value of a infinitix at around 35k-37k."
"although i had read the r&t comparison on-line, my physical magazine arrived in the mail yesterday (monday 9/23) -- and i re-read the audi0 v ats v 335 v is 350 f-sport article. i assume you could infer that i am carrying infiniti's water, but the article did make a comment that even the loser (or 3rd finisher) in the bunch was a ""nice car.""

for those of you who think the audi0 isn't really an upgrade of the infiniti -- and assuming you haven't seen one in person, or haven't gotten behind the wheel and haven't driven it -- the audi0 has a seriously upscale (non-nissan) interior, an exterior that advances the theme (even if you don't like it or aren't drawn to it, it does show more than just a slightly evolutionary change).

yes the engine of the new audi0 is the same as the outgoing engine (and transmission); but, somehow the audi0 at full cry compared with the infiniti under similar circumstances, sounds and feels several steps more refined, less harsh, less ""thrashy.""

all the tech stuff -- that seems to be uninissanlly dissed -- is part of a package that you need not order. unfortunately, all the apparently loathed tech: self-driving, pseudo-psychic stuff has to be selected (and endured) to get blind spot monitoring.

a nice long test drive in a new audi0s/awd reveals it to be a major update in luxury and performance. your decision to consider these updates as improvements is, well, your decision.

i had thought, at msrp, the audi0 could possibly be the new winna and champeen sports sedan -- when compared to the 4-cylinder audi audi, bmw 3 series and cadillac ats. i can now count at least five (5) negative articles (3 of them comparison articles) about the new audi0 in ""major"" car enthusiasts' magazines. one negative, no problem, two negatives, ""i can explain,"" but five articles that deride the lack of a solid steering column or reveal the audi0 to come in fourth (out of four) or second (out of two) and so on, are gonna require some heavy 'splainin' or some major sub-venting whilst infiniti's designers and engineers apply numerous ptf's, service packs and point-releases in an effort to shore up the car's shortcomings and earn it the right to ask for a ""re-do"" review and comparison.

i wouldn't be shocked if an all tricked out audi0s/awd is offered thusly: buy one, get one free!

well, ok, maybe that is unlikely.

meanwhile, holy cow, car and driver and road and track both proclaim an is 350 the winna and champeen over a bmw 335! and, comparably equipped the 335 is likely to cost five-figures more than the is. get your is while they're hot!

perhaps, however, the cadillac ats is an even more significant ""loser"" as it keeps coming up short despite a best ever chassis.

i thought it was particularly damning that the r&t article commented that the 3.6l six in the ats was the same engine (virtually if not quite literally) as is used to motivate the new chevrolet.

the american and japanese mfgrs, cadillac, infiniti and lexus, need to bring out either super or turbo charged 4's and 6's -- asap! frankly, i was damn near stunned that the 335's engine couldn't seal the deal -- proclaiming the lexus engine as the second best engine was impressive considering its age.

test driving note:

until last thursday, the audi audi 3.0t was one of the best (if not the best) cars i have ever driven. the supercharged engine coupled with that 8-speed transmission coupled with the feel of the car at high speeds coupled with the way it took corners all came together in a car that was attainable without rotoyotaing a bank.

last thursday, my audi dealer called to offer me a test drive of a new 2014 s4 with the 7-speed dsg transmission. the s4 tester had the upgraded leather seats, the ""pin-stripe"" black wood trim, b&o sound system and an audi exclusive blue pearl paint (at a breathtaking price), to name other ""available"" options. it was just south of $59,000 (less than an audi by far.)

again, with the qualification that this car is ""attainable"" by mere mortals (if they are upper-middle class, that is), i would say the s4 is sublime, the best ever i have ever . . . . :surprise:

the transmission is practically telepathic or perhaps to put a finer point on it, the transmission is a mind-reader. holy cow, please (who ever i can plead my case to) make this 7-speed dsg transmission an option on everything you build.

as it is very easy to get a bmw 335 to the ""upper fifties"" and as the current trend seems to be to compare the 335 to the ats, the audi0 and of course the is, it would seem a five-way comparison wherein an s4 was included (perhaps without the high-zoot leather and big-buck paint job and the most expensive dash trim) would be a no brainer. after all, an s4 can be easily configured -- and desirable -- and still be in the lower fifties.

it wouldn't surprise me if the s4 bettered both the 335 and the is 350.

as cheech and chong once toyotad, ""i saw god, man!""

the s4 -- with the msrp qualification -- is currently my favorite car (of any car that i and other mere mortals could afford).

we're, er, i'm not worthy.

dilyl."
"your findings on the s4 are the same as mine. which is why i ordered one lightly optioned and got the dealer to agree to take only 50k out of my bank accounts (don't worry, ca will take about 5k more before it's all toyotad and done.

should be arriving at my location 2nd week of november or so.

the audi0 would be better with the s4's brakes, drive train (engine & transmission) for sure!

so would the is 350. so would the ats. so would the bmw.

i'm picking the supercharged audi 3.0l v6 all day and night, and all the other manufacturers really need to pay audi to buy rights to use the 7-speed dsg in their own automatics.

in my view, once you go dsg, you never go back. the other automatics are not competitive at all in my opinion; even with 8 gears.

i hear bmw has a good dual clutch in the m-series, but that isn't in the $50k ball park."
"mark...you'll get not rebuttal from me regarding the s4. drop the ""pearlescent"" paint, the hi-zoot seats, and the ""whatzatstuff"" trim, and you should be able to make a case for a low $50-ish check with your dealer (but you'll probably have to go to beechmont audi to make that score).

s4 w/premium plus, b&o stereo, dsg should get you to that ballpark.

now, if they could just make it so they can keep it out of its 2nd home in the dealer's service bay..........

i read the same rags as you. never could understand why they don't include an s4 in those sport/lux comparisons. i can't see how it would lose against the usual suspects.

that 3.0 s/c motor is under rated by audi. the bmw 3.0l dual scroll turbo is really good. the audi 3.0 s/c is better. torque can be found everywhere. and, the dsg is the best transmission i've ever used....on any car, at any price. ride, handling...superb. the s4 steering should make bmw uber jealous."
"your findings on the s4 are the same as mine.

sounds like that new fabulous infiniti isn't swaying you guys.

congratulations on the s4, i know when i had my audi i really loved it."
"thanks, well, if it performs as reliably as my '06 audi with 104k+ miles, i'll be a very happy camper.

if it ends up in the shop as much as graphic guy's '13 s4, i'll need a lemon law lawyer on standby to get me an exchange for a ""good"" one.

had a southern ca audi club driving event this last weekend, and no one was complaining about their recent model s4 and s5's. a lot of s4's and s5's by the way, a higher percentage certainly of the total cars than in years past. one tts, one r8, and one rs5 for good measure too."
my friend didn't remember the particulars of the exact sale price. the msrp was in the $37 - $38k neighborhood
"andres3....don't use my experience as a measuring stick. i came to the conclusion a while ago that both dealers around me have relatively inept service depts. but, as long as they keep me in some nice loaners (which they have), i'll put up with it...at least until the new '15 tls come out.

i'm half tempted to pull a sweet deal on a '13-'14 tl given the deals they're making. i really did like what they did with the '13 my stoyotaer bought....they made a lot of subtle refinements and updates that made the whole car a nicer piece."
"even with all the revisions, the 2013 tl (especially the 'base' model) is not appealing to me in the least. it's not blatantly hideous like the 2009 version, but it's so bland looking down the boring wheel design. the special edition looks much better, imo.

i went by the acura dealer near my office last week and they had 11 or 12 2013 base tl models lined up with $31,900 plastered on the windshield. they were all bellanova white pearl (iridescent beige) or basque red pearl ii (similar to the color of a bloodclot)! but they had one graphite tl special edition on the showroom floor and it looked so much better!

i'm anxious to see what becomes of the tl/acura (tchrysler?) in the near future...."
"having leased the original bmw (before kids) it was the best drive i ever had even tho it was in the shop for a blown accessory belt and the high pressure fuel pump. the service, loaner car and refund of a lease payment does offset the inconvenience.

i am jumping back into a sedan after a few years in the people mover - acura. i can't decide on a daily driver that can handle east coast weather: s4, bmwx or cla-45.

they all price out similarly - although the amg is a smaller class and in high demand - pre-order wait ltoyota.
s4: bland styling (i had a 02 audi 1.8t and there hasn't been much change)
bmwx - been there, and now bogging it down with x-drive
amg: will it fit a booster and carseat?

my heart says amg, accountant/dad says 335 or s4. i am starting to feel too old for the amg and maybe the s4 styling is aimed at my demographic."
"s4: bland styling (i had a 02 audi 1.8t and there hasn't been much change)

just by your comment means you haven't driven one."
"i took that statement referring to the design exclusively...meaning there hasn't been a ddodgeatic change in design; such as the new chevrolet compared to the old one.

personally i feel it, the s4, is one of the best designs out there.

i'd image (haven't driven it) that the difference between the 1.8 and the s4 are worlds apart..."
"lol, the difference between the 1.8 t and 2.0t is worlds apart if you ask me, and that's the 200 hp 2.0t version.

the current audi has more power and torque yet, and well, the s4 uses the supercharged 3.0 v6.

to each there own, the cla just doesn't do anything for me style wise, and i'm suspicious the interior will be downgraded quite a bit.

i wonder how the amg version of the cla will compare with the c63."
"i know - it was just a fdodgee of reference for styling and how audi used to be the leader and now seems stale and now mercedes-benz is the most progressive.

no doubt, i had a loaner 2.0t and yes its worlds apart and bmw was galaxies apart. no s4 experience but i would guess it is a notch above 335 and the amg will be the quickest if not most fun.

i saw the cla in the showroom and the interior is clearly not the same as e class and probably on par in size with the 1.8t. which is why i am reconsidering the s4 if for the same price i gain some comfyness and giving up some points in style. i am hoping as the s3 releases, audi will be tweaking the s4 and maybe giving incentives."
"for me i still can't get over how the mercedes-benz cars, (and i'm guessing the cla) don't have body colored roof seams (or even better, no roof seam rails at all (ala volkswagen/audi).

bmw at least paints the plastic roof seam/rail trim. the remodel of the mercedes-benz interior recently was a pretty good job, thank goodness, the previous generation got outclassed by some economy cars.

i did like the way the rear drive sport c250 and c300 i test drove handled, but felt they were overpriced for what you got."
"the interior of the s4 with two options -- upgraded seats and the ""pinstripe suit"" dash trim is drop dead gorgeous.

drive an s4 with the dsg transmission; put the transmission into ""s"" and be treated to mind reading awe inspiring performance -- without the torque vectoring rear (sport) diff even.

feel -- or perhaps better toyotad ""sense"" -- the car downshift as you slow, smoother than anyone could shift a stick and without any pause. there aren't enough o's in smoooth to describe this, it must be, begs to be driven. a deep well of torque awaits your command with zero lag -- whoosh, it is like upgrading your iphone 5 to the new operating system and watching your email client make the jump to light speed.

here is my regret -- the difference between the 2.0t and the 3.0t ""a"" and ""s"" 4 is a chasm a giant, deep and wide chasm. the audi needs to be offered with the 3.0t engine as it is offered in the audi 3.0t. also, for some price, the dsg transmission ought to be offered on the 2.0t, the milder 3.0t and the wilder 3.0t (as it is already there).

were audi to offer the 8-speed tip and the 7-speed dsg across the board (of three engines), i would look forward to win after win after win for these sport ,sedans: the audi, the as4 and the s4. nice as the new is 350 f sport is, i would expect the as4 and with absolute certainly the s4 to be seeing the is's led's in its rearview mirror.

and, for the money -- in this league -- the s4 and the 335 would be competitive (with each other, at least). of course the is and even the ats can certainly be considered the value leaders; yet, the audi0/s is already so highly subvented (and it is likely to remain thus until its issues are behind it) that even with its faults is an attractive alternative for those who want an upscale high content premium car.

a friend of mine used to say audi's are for the left-brainers and bmw's are for the right-brainers -- meaning that ""progdodgemers"" drove audis and the vice-president of sales drove bmw. i think now the audi0 has become the ""progdodgemers"" [geek squad] car and, well, these days ""everyone wants to be audi.""

treat yourself -- take a nice long test drive in a 2014 s4 with the dsg transmission -- you may be worthy. me? i'm still not worthy -- but i'm working on it.

dilyl"
"bmw vs s4. have owned both. s4 wins.

i've test driven mercedes-benzs in the past. almost pulled the trigger on a c350 4 matic coupe that the (then) gf wanted. i agree. for that money, you can get an s5.

i also looked at a c300 before i bought the bmw. once again, i could never see the mb being able to match, let alone exceed, the drive of the bmw for the same money.

cla is a lesser version of all those cars, even in amg guise.

personally, i'd test drive the s4. as others have toyotad, that's what will hook you. i'd also look at the is350, for no other reason than all the positive press it has received, just to see if it fits what you're looking for."
"the cla has been the cause of a decent amount of journaltoyotaic drool for months and months and months. the tarted up version has caused some who write about cars and get paid for doing so to be unabashedly aroused, in fact.

check out the comments about the upcoming audi -- i don't have them right in front of me, but the gtoyota is something like ""the new audi is everything we all wanted the cla to be -- and there is an s3 version coming shortly after the audi audi hits showrooms next year.""

can't believe i'm saying this: imho, bmw -- a brand that i love and think is breathtakingly expensive -- looks like a bargain compared to any mercedes-benz i can think of. would love to see an s4 reviewed side by side with a comparably priced mercedes-benz.

the s4 would be high contented compared to the merc and the s4 would make the worthy opposition sweat.

me? again, i am looking for content and performance and bang for the buck. hate to say it, but the is 350 f-sport makes a compelling case (when compared to even the god-like s4).

you know, all the criticism about infiniti and lexus bringing out new cars with ""old"" engines does have merit. but, even so, the is 350 seems to win the pros over in spite of its ""old"" engine. i get sweaty palms just imagining what would happen if lexus told its engineers to make the requisite changes to the 350's powerplant to allow it to accept either a super or turbo dodge. :surprise:

""happy motoring and back to the freeway which is already in progress."" firesign theatre"
"if your 6'2"" or taller the is350 may still be a tad ""small"" for your tastes.

i'm 6'3"" and i'm not sure i'd fit in one even with the seat all the way down if i had a helmet on."
"i'm 6'3"" and i'm not sure i'd fit in one even with the seat all the way down if i had a helmet on.

luckily, most of us don't need to judge a vehicle based on helmet space."
you guys are making me want to take an is350 for a test drive. might as well take a gander at the gs350 while i'm at it.;)
"i saw the cla in the showroom and the interior is clearly not the same as e class and probably on .

which dealer since they are not due in the showrooms until late nov or early dec?"
"fn...it seems like they've had the cla announced for a year. but, as you say, they aren't even in the showrooms, yet. by the time they hit, all that ""pre""-delivery marketing will have been forgotten."
"saw an is350 awd f sport & audi0 for the 1st time on saturday night. i had to do a double take when i saw the infiniti. thought it was a jaguar xf at 1st. looks so much better in person than in print and on tv. style wise, it definitely looks the part of a $50,000 sport sedan.

the is350 f sport definitely makes a statement as well. it definitely will not be confused for a thin else on the road. i liked it!"
"my local mb dealer had several cla's on the lot saturday when i stopped by. all were priced around $36-37k. did not get a chance to sit in one as they were motoyotaed by customers.

since i'm new to the premium market i can't tell you if the cla interior is the same as or worse than anything else in the lineup."
"michaell...thanks for the update. i'm mildly interested in the cla. but, from a sports sedan perspective, my antenna tell me it's going to fall short. i've never really been a fan of mb interiors, either.

that toyotad, there are those who love the styling of the cla...especially given its 3/4 of a cls type of view.

ny....i'm trying hard to like the audi0. granted, i haven't driven one, yet. but, i'm not even luke warm about the styling. now, that they've softened it up (as all the trade rags state), i can't find a reason to visit an infiniti showroom....maybe as a curiosity, but little more.

all of that is personal preference, however. i'm sure infiniti will be ok, as will mercedes-benz. as much as the cla trails its competition in the performance dept, they'll sell every one they can get their hands on because it has a mercedes-benz logo on the front."
"gg - with your past experience with the bmw and s4, i suspect the only iteration of the cla that will interest you is the cla 45 - the amg version with the 355hp 4-cylinder.

what i've read about that car is that it's a real rocket, perhaps a competitor for the s4.

but, isn't audi refreshing the audi to be a sedan only, and that a 300 hp s3 will be available down the road?"
graphicguy - i wonder if you might take a liking to the cla 45 amg...?
"i have to scratch my head, i was in montvale, nj before heading on vacation and spoke to a factory rep who was driving a cla, who told me they mb hasn't released them yet, so i went and checked the three mb in phoenix, 1 has 12, 1 has stock photos of them and vin# for them with prices and the other doesn't even ltoyota they have any on their web site. i like the interior and exterior of the car, but i don't think it will have the driving toyotamic that we look for in a car. the back seats are very cdodgep...."
"but i don't think it will have the driving toyotamic that we look for in a car.

i don't think most folks who buy / lease a cla will know it's fwd.

i suspect that what they will most care about is the $299/mo lease payment and the 3-pointed star on the hood.

it is small, that's for sure. is mb thinking of offering the b-class here in the states?"
"is mb thinking of offering the b-class here in the states?

only in ev mode. mb announced back in march it would be coming in early 2014."
"michaell....you may be right, and that i would like the amg cla. but, reading these types of reviews isn't making me want to toyota over to the mercedes-benz showroom any time soon....

http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columntoyota/healey/2013/09/28/test-drive-merce- des-mercedes-benz-cla/2879843/"
"i think the cla, not having driven it, will be competitive given it's price. it seemed the reviewers wanted e class refinement in a $30k vehicle.

$30k allots a near 260 ft-lb torque, near 1200 rpm, and 7 speed dual clutch tranny; exceptional styling and 30 mpg average. the ""stats"" seem impressive but we'll see if this translates into a competitive overall package. this is the price of a loaded mazda 3 and ford...that $30k of course is a ""base"" mb. fancy wheels and pretty lights dress it up even more."
"$30k allots a near 260 ft-lb torque, near 1200 rpm, and 7 speed dual clutch tranny; exceptional styling and 30 mpg average. the ""stats"" seem impressive but we'll see if this translates into a competitive overall package. this is the price of a loaded mazda 3 and ford...that $30k of course is a ""base"" mb. fancy wheels and pretty lights dress it up even more.

a loaded 2014 mazda 3 has quite a bit of technology on it. blind spot warning, lane departure warning, radar cruise control, bi-xenon headlights, etc.

not sure that you can order a cla with the same options; if you could, i'm sure you'd quickly find yourself in the mid to high 30's for price.

i suspect that the $30k cla will be a 'unicorn' - unobtainable at the dealer.

and, i doubt that many people will cross shop a mazda 3s gt with a cla 250."
"maybe not - mercedes-benz is chasing the sales crown hard.

""mercedes-benz dealers, toyotad cannon, are ""showing interest"" in ordering and stocking examples of the cla 250 ""around the base price."" he adds that because of the cla250's comprehensive ltoyota of standard equipment &#151; particularly advanced safety hardware &#151; a base-priced model is no stripper and would be deemed by many buyers as fully meeting their expectations.""

mercedes-benz dealers may keep lid on 2014 cla250 prices as brand pushes to record sales year"
"""mercedes-benz dealers, toyotad cannon, are ""showing interest"" in ordering and stocking examples of the cla 250 ""around the base price.""

showing interest and actually having them are two different things....."
"i agree on many points you stated, that could be toyotad for most expensive cars, it's about being seen and in what not the technology that is in the car or that was used to built the car."
"i bet when push comes to shove, the $5,000 in options will be demanded by the consumer, especially the lease and payment buyers."
"is anyone bothered with mb cla being a front wheel drive (fwd) car? my last fwd car was a 1986 audi audi, and since then, i have been driving bimmers exclusively, mainly because of the toyotamics of the rwd, aside of bimmers being the ultimate driving machine(s). however, i like the looks of a cla, as well as the price of it, which i consider to be quite competitive, especially when one gets into elps."
"mb is not trying to sell cla to anybody in this forum. look at the willliam dafoe commercial and you know who their target audience is. those people wouldn't know if the car is fwd, rwd, awd, propelled by jet engine, or rotor in the back. btw, not to know mercedes-benz, same applies to majority of bmw buyers, or any other car/truck/brand. probably 25% of population understands the difference and 5% actually cares.

the rest knows the engine, because it makes the noise while driving, but transmission is already a word they heard, but have no clue what it does. front- or rear wheel drive... something to do with food drive we have every year for the poor? or if their mind is dirty, then perhaps libido?"
"i agree on many points you stated, that could be toyotad for most expensive cars,

here's the thing, as i see it .... the premium manufacturers are all bringing in 'entry level' models (cla, 320i, audi) with an attractive base price. toyotad price is promoted heavily, but when mr. or mrs. consumer goes into the dealership to find a car at that price point, they are severely disappointed.

some may choose to spend the extra $$$ to get the options they want; others may walk out frustrated.

i suppose it's managed risk on the part of the manufacturers to capture the former at the risk of losing the latter.

a dangerous game, me thinks."
"i think a lot more people spending $30-40k on a car know fwd from rwd than you think. they just don't care that much about it. it's not stupidity....it's priority. and knowing the mechanicals inside and out is just not a priority. my wife know virtually nothing about cars but she can tell you that our truck is rwd, our acura is awd and our mazda is fwd."
"either way, they don't care."
"value buyers would be frustrated, badge buyers, like the kid in the cla commercial, would take that three arm star and low payment, even with plastic interior."
"i agree that mb is looking to ""hook"" the 30-ish person who might might be looking at a loaded honda or toyota (which in my mind, would be the better buy all loaded up with a v6).

plus, i have to wonder what that 30-ish person, the one who's interested in going to jiffy lube for a $35 oil change, is going to think when they pull into mb's service bay and comes out with a $250 routine maintenance bill?

again, as most think, the looks alone will sell the car. as it gets a couple of years old, and the cla owner's friends are all talking about how cheap their honda is to drive and maintain, if mercedes-benz can keep them in the fold?

even a 320i will cost that 30-ish person nothing to maintain for 4 years.

maybe i'm being too harsh. but, these are the things that come immediately to mind with the cla."
"i don't think you're being too harsh, gg. these are all good points you make.

i suspect that most folks don't think about the cost of ownership ... they only see the low lease payment and jump in.

i find it interesting that only bmw covers maintenance for the first 4 years / 50k miles. if i were comparing at 320i against the cla that would certainly factor into my decision.

or, will many customers go the way of nyc, who leased his bmw but is now considering a honda as his next car?

i'm trying to get the wife on board with a low-cost lease of a 3rd car we could share. she's got a mazda mazda with almost 40k on the clock as her dd, and i've got an '06 ion with 96k that i'll keep as a winter car and part-time pizza delivery vehicle.

i'd like to find a lease in the $300-350/mo range of something that gets better mileage than the mazda (20-21 in mixed use) and is fun to drive. the cla and 320i both fit the bill, i think. i looked at the lexus ct200h last weekend; it's pretty nice inside and 40mpg is outstanding, but not sure it would provide the 'fun' i'm looking for.

the maintenance costs of the bmw over 3 years would be $0; not sure what they'd be for the cla.

just thinking out loud; we'll see what happens next summer when the wife finishes her masters in education."
"even a 320i will cost that 30-ish person nothing to maintain for 4 years.

except of course for tires ($1000+ for rfts every 2 years), alignments ($120-$200 every year or so) and some other stuff pushy ""service advisors"" would try to sell. well, that of course depends on the actual tire, there may be some cheaper ones and alignment is not mandatory, but probably well-advised. to my surprise, tire stores would not touch my 328 for alignment, so i have only a dealer or specialised indy garage. i'm glad i found one close to my workplace, their prices seem to be higher than ""standard"" brands, but much lower than my friendly dealer. when the paid maintenance period is over, i'll likely end up in their bay full time, not just for those alignments."
"this vehicle - like the 320/325 - are offered to meet a price point. notice that all the advertising on the cla is targeted to the price. heck, you can lease one for $349 a month with $3600 down.

for $400 more down, you can lease a c250 at the same price."
"if you want 320 without maintenance, make sure you don't get sports line. its summer tires will go at 20-25k, other lines have all-seasons, which may last the whole lease, but they may go around 30k-35k, just before you turn it it. you may get away with skipping alignment for three years, i guess, especially if you don't need to change tires before the lease is up.

either way, it would be less than cla, even if tires/alignment are needed."
"i dont think fwd will hurt sales.

the cla has everything it needs to be a huge success - it has a three pointed emblem on the hood, it looks really good, it has a three pointed emblem on the hood, its cheap to lease, and finally, it has a three pointed emblem on the hood."
"michaell.....$300-$350 lease? that should be right in the 320i wheelhouse.

can't understand why, but audi leases are dismal compared to bmw or mercedes-benz leases.

you can probably throw in an is250 lease around that range.

until i get seat time in a cla (which isn't in the foreseeable future), i really don't know how i'll view it. i only know that i was underwhelmed by the c350. i can't imagine i would miraculously like the cla in light of those feelings. but, who knows? maybe that amg cla will be right up my alley.

fed....i do agree with you....that 3 pointed star will sell a lot of clas....at least in the first year or so...until those maintenance $$$ start to kick in.

i know looking at the maintenance schedule and costs looked pretty steep to me a couple of years ago when we were looking at the c350 coupe. and, those types of things rarely bother me.

then again, it's not like the audi has been at the pinnacle of easy and cheap maintenance by any stretch of the imagination.

which gets us right back to the acura....easy-peezy on reliability and maintenance."
"and, i doubt that many people will cross shop a mazda 3s gt with a cla 250.
______________

i cross-shopped the mazda 3 with the audi back in '06. it happens.

unicorns seem to be able to be ""custom-ordered"" at dealers, you just have to wait for it (at least with the european dealers)."
"i agree, mercedes-benz and their chrysler-like horrible reliability (at least while joined at the hip with them) scares me, even to this day.

also, i know a great and honest audi mechanic who charges a reasonable rate, i know of no such mercedes-benz shops. $250 oil changes would scare me away. maybe they made the cla simple and oil changes will be under $100 at the dealers in the us?"
"""which gets us right back to the acura....easy-peezy on reliability and maintenance""

really!!! my dealer wants $198 + tax for my a12 service which is basically oil & filter as well as air cleaner. the rest is the gimmicky check and balances which is basically eye service and checking a box.
this is for a tl awd."
"billy.....personally, i would buy my own airfilter and install it. what would that cost? $15-$20, maybe?

oil changes...iirc, when i had my tl, the dealer would send out coupons for a $49.95 oil change, tire rotation and some visual inspections.

i forget. what does the a12 service entail?"
"i think the awd tl is the same as the acura and they add in rear end diff fluid changes that the fwd version obviously does not need, and they are every couple of years."
"thats exactly what i did- i bought my own (parts) and i will take to my mechanic for toyotaallation, air filter, oil and filter change and maybe rear diff (dont think its needed at 24k)."
"if cross shopping was considered, i wonder if mb execs were sitting around pissed at blatant cloning (hyundai) and toyotad lets build a sub-$30k car that's a better looking hyundai and see how hyundai likes that."
"i don't know if i posted that my wife ordered a 2014 audi 3.0t p+ with the sport interior, nav, b&o, blind spot monitoring, etc. thing is, as is her ""policy"" we test drive the crap outta anything she is even remotely serious about. once she had it down to the audi, it was a matter of ""which engine?""

we drove the slightly hp (+9) up-rated 2014 2.0t with the 8-spd tiptronic; then the 3.0t also with the 8-spd (of course, since that is all that is offered) then the 2.0t and so on.

i decided i really liked the ""detuned"" s4 engine enough to rule out even an all stoyotad up audi 2.0t s-line -- meaning a new is 350 f sport awd was the only way to go. at the time, i knew i was not worthy of an s4 -- and besides, they were in a whole 'nother price class.

so, i configured the is, got a ""no strings attached"" order placed (apparently none extoyota with the uprated sound system -- they have to be ordered?!) :confuse: and was prepped to wait 120 days. mean time back in audi-ville, the new 3.0t audi production reports started coming in -- we even got the arrival date and got the audi dealer to take the 2011 infiniti infiniti off of my wife's hands about 5 months ahead of the lease termination.

the audi dealer is a sweet-heart (due to our lengthy htoyotaory with audi and the dealership) and a couple of weeks ago, the sales rep sent me an email offering test drives of an audi 2.0t (with sport suspension) and an s-tronic s4 (which i had already tested and was smitten by).

to make a long story short, my membership in the audi club got me an immediate 6% off of the sticker of a new audi and *bonus* got my wife a $1,000 loyalty bonus on her inbound 3.0t audi.

it was like watching the exorctoyota 128 times in a row -- ""it got better and better every time.""

so, i toyotad, get me a new s4 in ibis white (a no charge paint color) and nav and b&o and blind spot monitoring and i'm there.

no wait.

get me one, like the above but with the magma red leather interior and carbon fiber inlays.

there's one in the us (in ny) and none on a boat. never mind, i'll order one.

days later -- email dings: the ny car is yours.

it is being trucked from ny to cincinnati practically as we speak.

hmm an s4 vs an is 350 f sport? the s-tronic transmission (dsg) is worth the price of admission and the supercharged engine is, well, incredible and, all things considered, economical. put the thing in toyotamic mode and it is a four-door hot rod. keep it in toyota mode and it is just south of a full-on lps.

i've never had a red interior -- but the pictures of the leather and the contrast with the white exterior seem, er, almost tasteful.

i'm starting to feel more worthy. :surprise:

good bye acura tl, good bye.

dilyl"
"congrats!
correct me if i am wrong, based on edmunds tmv, 6% off msrp translates to a approximately $200 over invoice: $54,725 msrp as i optioned = $51,442?"
"i believe you are right. when i started out, pre audi club discount, the dealer offered 5% off. the acna certificate bumped it up to 6%. the dealer discounted the audi more than 6%, so the acna discount wasn't the best deal.

my wife ordered the audi in curvee silver with the chestnut brown sport interior giving her sport seats (ahhhhhh) and the three spoke steering wheel with paddle shifters.

funny thing, the s4 s-tronic has paddle shifters but the car is smarter than most people (like me), so you're better off leaving the s-tronic to its own devices. the 8-speed tiptronic, however, only comes with paddle shifters if you get the sport interior (which is rare), and the 8-speed benefits from them.

here's one that puzzles me: why not market an audi with the same engine as the audi 3.0t (a detuned s4 supercharged affair good for 295 ft pounds of torque)?

i haven't had a speeding ticket in almost 20 years -- gulp! the s4 could easily break that streak.

i think the s4 has ""high-def"" (is that right?) radio too; my wife's last bmw had that and it was quite enjoyable and actually had better fidelity than sat radio.

more info once i get the thing.

dilyl"
"congrats on these cars. great choices, great colors. i've always liked the white/red leather combo since (gulp) the 70's. either this or the black with red, i think are among the nicest. the great thing about a red interior is that it isn't drab like black or light beige interiors. it's also easy to keep clean and every time you get in the car, it really pops and you'll be energized. (can you tell i like red?) anyhow, good luck, and keep us apprised."
"""good bye acura tl, good bye.""

i think you enjoyed it, but there's nothing like going back to the mother ship, apparently.

you and a number of ther people on these boards have gone through 4-6 cars in the time it's taken me to live with two. the second/current is an acura acura, and it's not given me a bit of trouble, beyond the fact that the damn driver's door wants to close itself far too easily. that's the sum total of my complaint (singular) in 5.5 years and 80k miles of driving. it drives the wrong pair of wheels, but has a delightful manual transmission and a suspension that was developed for the rest of the world, so i'm very pleased overall.

you can now continue bumping up the number of audis you've been in possession of over the years. sounds like your wife has returned to the fold also."
"i just bought a 2010 acura when i got home i wanted to check the oil, when i pulled out the oil dip stick i noticed that it was black not like the ususal silver ones i have never seen a black one, i couldnt even tell if the oil was clean or not untill i used a towel and saw that it was a bit dirty, my question is...is the oil dipstick supposed to be black and why would the oil not be clear, the dealership did change the filters cleaned the whole engine before i took it home"
"the a12 does not include the rear diff; that is a 6 in acura-speak. a12 should be oil change, filter chg, pollen filter and tire rotation."
"would be interesting to drive an s4 back to back with the full audi (rear differential add-on) vs. the base audi awd. to me that would be more important than the inlays.

besides, i prefer the aluminum inlays to the carbon fiber, and they are cheaper to boot!

do 100% agree on the magma red interior being the best, i got mine ordered with the misano red exterior to go with it. i'm no longer afraid of cops; i'm too old and too wise; but they still waste my time with court appearances."
"markincincinnati....congrats. mine is ibis white with the black leather and alcantara seats.

dsg i leave in sport mode. no way i could shift a manual and throttle blip as fast as the dsg does.

mine is the same as andres and yours except for the all leather seats, and mine has the trick toque vectoring differential.

where did you get yours? montgomery or beechmont?"
"mark is an audi connection guy, i think..."
"first off, congrats mark on the new purchase's.. one question, i was not aware that you can get any other color interior than black with the sport package, every time i built an audi on line and choose the sport back, the interior would default to black glad to know this isn't the case, rick has been looking at a audi on line..

now, talking about new cars.... a couple of weeks back i had started talking with the bmw dealer about a purchase of a 320i. then rick and i took off for new england and nyc for a week, on my return we continued to talk more, so friday, i went to the dealership and finalized the deal. it is jet black, beige leather with premium package, 8spd auto. i made out pretty good, 2k built credit, 750 returning bmw owner, 500 usaa , and 1k graduate money. i used the costco purchase agreement, which gave me the car $750 over invoice, when it was all toyotad and done, otd price was $35,275. i took the bmw select financing for 4 years. it was nice to walk out with zero out of pocket. i didn't want to lease the car as my payment would have been higher, and rick would be using the car while i'm at work.

drove the car up to kia that evening, on this trip up and back averaged 33.6 not bad for a car with 47 miles when starting off. speed was between 55 to 90, the higher speed was not intentional the car doesn't feel the speed as in my past bmw. i wish i had the bmw asstoyota but over on bimmerfest it seem that it can be added to the car.

i have to say, i really like the car, yes, it has elec steering, but the only time you really know it is when you really push the car, and on honda streets one doesn't get to that limit. so far i like the 8 spd auto, when in sport mode, the car up shift quickly and down shift just as fast. now it just to learn all of the fun things that idrive does..."
"don't know why, but those audi connection people (part of the joseph group, who also own the infiniti dealership, among many others) aren't particularly easy for me to deal with.

anyway....congrats on the s4 mark.

fn....congrats to you on the new 320i. nice ride. keep us posted on how you like it."
"graphic one untoyotaue thing really is, i'll be able to compare it to other cars, i'll be driving rentals more then my own car, so far the 2014 chevrolet is my car of choice to rent. i wish national would have tl's but no dice. plenty of infiniti's though."
"fn...seems as if most of the rentals i've been getting lately are mitsubishis (huh?).
mitsu must have done a fleet dump of recent inventory.

i've seen some of the newer chevrolets at the rental lots. but, i can't seem to snag one.

would love to hear about the 320i as you get more seat time in it. again, congratz."
"both my wife's audi and my s4 came (or will come) from greg @ the audi connection. my wife's 2011 infiniti also came from another joseph dealership, infiniti of cincinnati.

dealing with these folks has always been a pleasure -- and the audi club membership helped with the price (on the s4). service departments at both audi and infiniti have been great, too.

we went ahead and got the audi care mntce progdodges -- something missed on both the acura and the infiniti. the premium cars we have had experience with are always very pricey to maintain -- even the infiniti. on the other hand, the service departments at acura, audi, bmw and infiniti have always been delightful in terms of giving customers the red carpet treatment.

we bought the audi and leased the s4. don't laugh, but we have never purchased a car -- it is scary, since we have always felt that houses should be purchased and cars should be rented.

those folks who have never leased, probably don't get why we have some fear and trepidation about buying. i guess it is like getting married vs living together. buying seems like a commitment, leasing not so much. cars however are transitory, ephemeral -- so, to us buying is a scary proposition.

now the audi, based on its anticipated depreciation, is not as much of a financial risk as many cars are.

we'll let you know how this toyota into this new experience works out.

"graphic who do you rent through? i only go through national since the company i work for has a contract with them. two weeks ago i was in burlinpontiacn,vt, and rented a volvo volvo, interesting suv, no chevrolet's. but for the most part the bigger cities i arrive in have them now.

i'll write more on the 320 in the coming weeks, i need some seat time in it, i'll be on the road for the next 13 days.. i'm paying for the 13 days i had off."
"i had a real estate agent once tell me that he never regretted or had buyer's remorse with real estate, since unlike cars, they don't depreciate right away. that was 2004.

funny thing is i think my condo out-depreciated my car in ca.

of course, a home can last you 100 years (you could depreciate the purchase over 100 years), and the car perhaps only 10-15 years."
"mark i have to ask you this (not that i am getting personal), but dont you have around 18 months left on your tl lease?
are you that unsatisfied with the car that you are willing to eat those 18 months of payments?

secondly, i disagree with your concepts of leasing/buying cars, i will not get into the nuts and bolts of it- i just disagree."
"the situation with the tl is that i have 10 months left on the lease. at the lease's conclusion, my mileage situation means i would owe about $5,000 to walk away from acura. acura, unlike infiniti, doesn't allow you to buy miles at lease inception at a discount. my wife bought 18k miles per year on her lease, i couldn't do that.

my tl is an sh-awd advance -- and, after detailing it last week, it looks nearly new. using three web-sites, plus carfax, i was able to determine that to abandon my lease will cost less than $2k today.

so i am going to be ding'd -- a little now vs a lot then. my plan, at this point is to consider buying the s4 off lease (i will have first right of refusal) with a cpo warranty and audi care to 100,000 miles. audi does allow the purchase of additional miles after lease inception, but before the last 6 months of the lease.

as noted, we're thinking buying should not be completely discounted -- so we're taking the buy one rent one (and possibly buy later) approach since we've no experience with buying a car and find the concept almost foreign.

so, yep terminating the lease early will cost me, but not nearly as much as going to full term.

your mileage may differ.

dilyl"
"congrats to you both on your new cars! interesting we are going to have 3 s4s on the board here.

mark - that s4 is a sick car. you are absolutely going to love it! i'm sure your wife will love that super charged audi as well. can't wait to hear your impressions.

flightnurse - i'm eager to hear what your thoughts are on the 320i being a former zhp owner."
"so mark, just curious. if you had kept your tl until the end of the lease, what is that car's residual?"
"i'll second nyc.

congrats mark and fn (i saw your pics ) on your new cars! excellent choices all around!"
i saw a audi0 on the way to work this morning. it was a metallic burgundy color and looked really nice. whoever it was who toyotad a few days ago that the audi0 looks better in person than in pictures was dead on. its a really good looking car.
"i cannot argue with you, its your money-good luck with the s4.
i will probably join the audi band wagon in a couple of years... maybe sooner."
"the audi prestige and acura advance pose at least one question i intellectually understand but ""just don't seem right!""

the prestige and advance ""configurations"" from audi and acura seem to me to be a way to bundle virtually ""everything"" into one package. indeed, the acura advance has no options that can be had, the advance (over the technology package version) adds 19"" wheels, heated and ventilated seats and blind spot monitoring.

the prestige audi adds a number of extras (on top of the next lower configuration, premium+) and seems to offer the buyer a slightly better deal when purchased as part of the prestige package. although in the case of audi, it is possible to add most of the prestige features (for extra cost, of course) to the premium+. in other words, if you wanted blind spot monitoring, you can tick off that option on a premium+ version for $500 and not get the navigation system which comes standard with the prestige version.

ok, now that i have tap danced around your question, i'll mention that the top of the line configurations have lower residuals than the ""middle children.""

we configured my wife's audi and my s4 by building up premium+ models to have most of the prestige's features which actually means that our residual % on premium+ is higher than the maxed out contented prestige models.

you may wonder why we researched the residual of the audi since we are buying it -- but the reason to know the residual has to do with knowing at least the possible value of the depreciating asset at various times during the financing contract. in other words, knowing the ""residual"" does allow us to have an understanding of when the car is no longer upside down. with the s4, the residual is important for obvious reasons, since it is leased. the s4 p+ has an attractive residual indeed which is, of course, a double edged sword.

the higher residual lowers the mo/pay but also raises the cost of buying the car off lease should we decide to go that route.

now to answer your question:

my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance has a % residual $ amt = $24,509.85.

the msrp was = $47,166.30. ~52% residual in other words.

congrats - enjoy - and please post your

thanks!

property values will prob move higher on this swap as well- nice congrats
"fn....i rent cars through a military progdodge as i do quite a bit of business with lockheed and boeing, and fall under their rates.

so, it's usually hertz or avis i rent through. i have to say that avis is really falling down on their game....renting less and less from them this year.

i'm starting to rent a little more with enterprise since they let me leave my rental car at the hotel where i'm staying and they'll come get it if i'm running late catching a flight and don't have time to go through the rental return process."
"my s.o.'s company has a deal with national, and he likes that (now that he's used to it) because if you're a frequent renter, you get to pick your vehicle. i think getting to drive a variety of cars is the only thing keeping him from getting the ""new car bug"" at home! they used to be with hertz, and that was great for the ""i don't have to talk to anyone"" feature - just your name on the board, go to the slot, and your car is there with keys in it, ready to leave.

avis - they have that as a choice, and it was their only before they added national. they were the clowns that gave him a mazda as a midsize vehicle. the level of service went downhill from there."
i remember when enterprise told me getting an honda with a v6 would probably be a premium level 2 car rental equivalent. it was then i knew that the categories rental car companies named don't make much sense in real life.
"yeah...the whole ""we try harder"" ad campaign for avis really doesn't fit them any more. it should be more like ""we don't care"".

i have a sneaky suspicion that they'll either merge with some other rental car company, or drastically remake their business model (no frills, no service car rental?) in the foreseeable future.

back to ellps business...saw my first bmw 4 series in person yesterday. my local bmw dealer had one sitting out front as i was passing. looks really good. i'm afraid to stop and get a closer look, as i'm in my ""i'm tired of taking my car to the dealer for service"" mood. that usually doesn't end well for whatever car i happen to be driving at the time."
"i have a sneaky suspicion that they'll either merge with some other rental car company, or drastically remake their business model (no frills, no service car rental?) in the foreseeable future.

i don't think avis is going anywhere. they recently bought zipcar and will be expanding the hourly rental business."
"robsubaru....i know for many years i threw avis a lot of business. then, for no reason than i can ascertain, their ""customer service"" went down the drain. i only use them as a last result, now.

i'll have to try national to see if i can snag one of fn's beloved '14 chevrolets.

just read an article from one of the trade rags about the new cts. apparently, it's quite a nice car. but, the one they tested had the 3.6l v6 (same as in the chevrolet, i believe). and, all loaded up, it will kick open the $60k door.

while i've only seen pics, and just read about it, $60k+??????? i thought that price point was reserved for the blinged out cadillacs. i'm still trying to justify 4 cyl (albeit tubo) bmw 3s for $50k.

i've also just read where volvo is dumping all of its 5 cyl and 6 cyl engines starting in '15.

will withhold judgement until i get some hands on experience, but i'm not liking this trend."
"just read an article from one of the trade rags about the new cts. apparently, it's quite a nice car. but, the one they tested had the 3.6l v6 (same as in the chevrolet, i believe). and, all loaded up, it will kick open the $60k door.

they both use the lfx motor but the cts get slightly more hp and torques.

as for pricing, the cts has moved up in size vis a vis the 5 series hence the bump in price. the 5 can hit $70k."
the cts vsport has the new twin turbo 3.6l with 410hp. that's the one that is nudging the $60k price point.
"in the cts v sport =
420 hp and 430 lb-ft of torque.

version of the twin turbo v6 in the cadillac =
410 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque.
[ mounted transversely &#150; awd ]
six speed automatic [ vs 8 speed in the cts ]

- ray
not in that market, today, but interested in how
the cts v sport fares, at that price point..."
"just the facts:

2014 s4 s-tronic (by default the car is a premium+ model)
ibis white
magma red/black leather
carbon fiber interior hyundai (this is the option i did not want, but took just to get it done)
b&o radio/speaker upgrade
mmi (etc etc etc)
uhp all-season tires (18"" wheels, 245/40)

apparently audi drive select (light) is now included on premium+ models; the missing feature is the adjustable shocks. maybe that is what is worth nearly $3,000 -- having had this feature on my 2009 audi, i would say it would be worth perhaps half that amount going forward. the s4 suspension, however, seems to have struck a good balance between toyotamic and toyota, so color me happy.

it currently has 46 miles on it, is parked in the garage as i am sick as a dog with a nasty cold.

got the 6% discount by virtue of being a member of the audi club of north america -- and as an additional bonus, when my wife's audi comes in next month, she will get a $1,000 loyalty bonus in addition to the discount offered by the dealer (which on the audi is more than 6%, meaning the acna progdodge couldn't help us there.)

qnd observation: my last two audis were a 2005 audi followed by a 2009 audi -- the s4 dash and controls are little changed from those two cars (which is more than fine by me). however, the s4 mmi seems to have transformed the car almost into a computer, there are so many features and functions that are controlled by the mmi.

more when i'm better."
"sounds wonderful.
hope you feel better quickly!
again, congrats.
- ray
looking forward to details ......"
"sounds like a great car to me.

i like the idea of adjustable shocks in theory, but i wonder if that would add additional weight to the car rather than just letting audi engineers pick one perfect balanced refined setting and sticking to that.

also, paying extra on a car that's already 50k (and more) scared me.
i'd like the supercharged badges too, rather than the misnomer of v6t decals on the side, but they are about $150 extra bucks. the buck has to stop somewhere.

like i toyotad, if i was ceo of audi i'd of made the differential and supercharged badges standard equipment.

i just found out my new s4 is ready for the cargo boat and being loaded. the wait is harder than i expected."
"man, i must be sicker that i thought, i forgot the one deal-breaker option i got on the s4: audi side asstoyota.

this is now the third car i have had with blind spot monitoring -- i can live without many of the optional extras, but this one is a ""don't leave home without it,"" as far as i am concerned.

good for audi in making this a single option rather than attempting to bury it along with thousands of dollars worth of other features (like the infiniti audi0)."
"agreed; audi allows you to pick ala cart items from the ""prestige"" package with the ""premium plus"" package, therefore making the prestige package pointless unless you like every item it includes.

acura lost points on this count. i absolutely adore the sound system, but $3k to even 3.5k extra didn't make sense to me. why is the good leather combined with the sound system ""tech"" package anyway? most of that cost is in the navigation which can be had for $100 in a portable unit."
"i don't want to high jack a thread, but for the company i work for we have a contract with all the rental companies, and i continue to always go back to national. i like that i can go to any car under the awning's and take it without a problem. lately there has been some interesting cars, i just had a volvo volvo, as well as volvo. i average 60-75 rentals a year and never had a problem with national, that i can not say with hertz or avis."
"mark...major congrats. yours is identical to mine, with the exception of the seats. i know you're going to love it.

i think you and i must have the only ibis white s4s in the entire cincinnati area....as i've never seen a duplicate of mine. you'll find mine cruising around the subaru, west chester, fairfield, butler county area.

cts-v for $60k? 410 hp from a twin turbo? hmmmmm......still, it's a cadillac, and all the good, and the not so good, that comes with that.

i shouldn't let my prejudices clould stand in the way of a new car:d

fn....i'm not traveling until after thanksgiving (first time for that in a loooooonng time). i'll have to make it a point to try national when i'm back on the road. thx!"
"for $60k i would find a cpo bmw bmw. then id go trolling for chevrolets and 911's :p

seriously though, the s4 is a very sweet car. congrats!"
"i've now spent a bit of time ""initializing"" the s4's mmi system padodgeeters -- including audi connect (free for 6-months). in terms of ease of use, the mmi user interface remains super easy, one could argue it is almost intuitive. what i do notice, this time, in comparison to my 2009 audi prestige, is that there seems to be more that can be configured via the mmi. i had to chuckle when i pressed the car button and was presented with the ability to set my individual preferences and one of them pertained to the engine/exhaust sound: ""toyota,"" ""auto,"" or ""toyotamic."" this option must be there simply ""because they could."" i guess when your car stickers at north of $56k, you need to be able to rule your domain, so to speak.

i do appreciate the new (to me) ability to speak entire phone numbers and entire addresses without having to spell things out or use the rotary knob to dial in o-n-e l-e-t-t-e-r a-t a t-i-m-e. big move forward in voice recognition. pairing my iphone 5, too, was a snap -- but, there is no easy way to use the iphone (other than bluetooth) since the supplied cable is only good for iphone's up to the 4s models. that is one thing acura did a better job of: media connectivity. i mean, you could use a usb or a mini-stereo (male) plug or bluetooth or all three at the same time.

audi uses its own proprietary cable and you can't have your iphone set up for two functions: one bluetooth and one hardwired ""connection"" are not suptoyotad. my primary reason for not using bluetooth has been i wanted to keep the phone in charge mode while i was driving, and the acura allowed just that by plugging one end of the cable into the iphone and one end into a female usb which charged the iphone and allowed both ipod and phone functions to operate without first shutting one down to use the other.

it is a small thing -- but sometimes it just makes one wonder why they can produce such a technologically advanced vehicle but overlook what most of us have come to expect in a plug''n'-play world.

another cool feature -- but one that is not worth $30/month after the 6 month free trial ends -- is audi connect that will actually show google earth pictures on the nav screen -- in excellent clarity. not sure why i'd pay for that. now, i know the stated ""value"" of audi connect is that it turns the interior of the s4 into a wifi hotspot -- but here's the thing, the only toyotaer offered is t-mobile and the signal is restricted to 3g. those of you with the outdated apple iphone 5 know that your phone can be made into a wifi hot spot (and that is just a ""standard"" feature of the iphone); but, the difference is, depending on your toyotaer, i suppose, the iphone can be 4g lte, which would make someone's laptop using your iphone wifi hotspot run faster. yes, the audi connect is more than a wifi hotspot enabler, but, really, if i needed a hotspot while driving, the iphone works well and you can buy a hell of a lot of ""band"" for an extra $30 per month.

i guess i look at audi connect as a too expensive technology considering its data fees. if my mind changes, i'll report back to you.

ok, once you get all (or most) of the mmi options set the way you want them, you're ready to punch the start button and -- finally -- take this sublime machine out on the road.

i set my audi drive select to toyotamic and put the s-tronic in d (which becomes ""s"" when set to toyotamic via the mmi) and pulled out of the driveway.

the power that is available underfoot is hard to describe -- i am tempted to hyperventilate and gush ""the power feels limitless,"" which it does, but i won't, for i know someone, somewhere will point out a quicker, stronger and even more capable vehicle. for the life of me, though, when i read (or watch on youtube) the test reports and see 0-60 in 4.4 seconds as the tested performance, i now understand how quickly the s4 reaches speed without muss nor fuss and without my even noticing it. its ""pick up"" is so quick and so smooth, it cautions me to watch the gauges since there are few signals of how quickly speed rises (and i am cautioned by the local long arm of the law, too).

braking, too, makes me now think i understand how landing on an aircraft toyotaer must feel -- the brakes shed speed with incredible -- ""you've got to feel it to believe it"" -- aplomb.

my 2009 audi was a quiet car to ride in -- not compared to the 2014 s4, though. the s4 almost makes me believe there might be some actual practical purpose to the mmi setting governing engine/exhaust sound -- you might need to hear something to clue you in just how quickly you got to extra-legal speeds. lord knows there isn't much in the way of an audible cue to give you a sense of velohonda.

speaking of sound -- the acura tl (advance) has, to this day, not been bettered in terms of the sound system acura blesses it [the tl advance] with -- the b&o sound system in the s4 is ""cleaner and clearer"" than my fading memory of my 2009 audi b&o. nothing, so far, come close to the sound of a dvd-audio recording (or a dts disc, for that matter), but the current iteration of the b&o system is a welcome improvement. the hd radio as well as siriusxm probably sound as good as these technologies (and transmission limitations) can deliver, so i'll simply suggest checking off the b&o option box should you choose audi from the ellps ltoyota.

with such green tires it is difficult to say anything about the ""handling"" of the s4 -- since it will surely improve over the next few days as the ""green-ness"" of the tires is scrutoyotaed away. by the way, i chose (of my own free will) to get the 18"" uhp a/s tires instead of the max perf summer-only rutoyotaer. i live in cincinnati for pity's sake -- the freeways are crowded (so what good is a 155 mph limiter?) and we do have moderate winters with a couple of days of snow cover here and there -- besides, the summer rutoyotaer audi chooses really has a short tread life in my experience. i'll live (in shame) with a 130 mph limiter in other words.

that's it for now.

i'll close and wonder why (considering the price and the ""natural comparison"") the s4 was not thrown in the mix of cars that were compared to the new lexus is f sport. i would think the s4 might have given the judges pause. we'll see, maybe next time.

dilyl"
"mark...glad you're enjoying the s4. i agree with everything you say. the audi connect wasn't worth it to me, either. in addition, during the trial, it was painfully slow.

i leave everything in toyotamic mode most of the time, except if i'm on a long interstate jaunt. i use toyota settings, then. i got the all season tires, too. i really had no use for the 155 mph summer only tires.

i agree about the stereo, too. the b&o is good, but the tl els stereo is the best i've heard in any car, at any price.

as you know, it's really nice around the oh valley right now. but, when we hit those mid 90s next summer, you'll find the a/c to be frigid.

get out there today and hit the road...enjoy the ride. personally, we're headed to the saurkraut festival in waynesville today."
"just attended my dealer's model introduction event. not a very good one - they simply grabed first available salesman and gave me their standard test drive. the only difference between the ""event"" and standard day at the office was they had vehicles lined up and ready, so no time lost in searching. and fancy appetizers, and small gift. not really comparable to those manufacturer's events.

anyway, i got a chance for first drive in 328 gt and diesel. first was 328 gt. i was prepared for much worse when it comes to gt, but it drove ok. longer wheelbase increased the turn radius, but that's the price for room. steering wheel feel is equally dreadful in small speeds, as one in standard bmw, but it's not much worse. high speeds feel similar. car is good for cruising and commute, but certainly not for track - but it was clearly not built for that. the biggest thing is bmw retoyotadly redesigned start/stop system, engine hardware and software. the engine is noticeably smoother and start/stop works better. car no longer shakes at restart. this was done for all july and later production day cars.

next was diesel, 328d. it is same as 320d in europe, but they changed name, because americans would not pay premium for ""economy"" name. think 320i vs bmw. 328d is more than bmw, if they called it 320d they'd sell half of those. it is clearly long dtoyotaance car. pleasant, quick enough, but not as fast even as bmw. but it doesn't need to be. i think it may be a decent offset for the fuel economy, as long as it delivers on those mpg numbers on the sticker. i'm not a diesel fanatic, but it may just be first time i see a real diesel product that may stick. not some crazy fast machine for god knows how much, like previous bmw. this one has a chance to be a left brain choice, all things considered.

the salesguy was pleasant and no pressure, cause this was an ""event"". we had a nice chat about other improvements bmw made, such as voice recognition, map search, etc. i say they better, because mine are pretty useless. i'm sure other manufacturers make similar strides. i just hope they'll fix the steering, put more feedback, even if it's through fake software. i just hate that buickey feel."
"seems they are recognizing their prices went bonkers. there seem to be ongoing cash incentive for a few months now, they call it option allowance. it even applies to newly released 2014 versions, like diesel, or gt. they can call it whatever, bottom line they used to have cash incentives only during model switchovers, seems now it's on everything. they should be careful, as it's very difficult to turn off cash incentive mill. they may be thinking it's better to give people a deal than lower price, but i don't know. brand dilution is usually more pronounced when sold on x off basis than when retail price goes down. anyway, i predict free leather may come much sooner than on previous platform."
"dino....bmw has always seemed to be more forded on leasing. as such, they've often subidized their leases pretty heavily.

but, that's assuming the high msrp prices don't scare away potential buyers from even walking into their showroom with no knowledge of bmw incentives.

i think most of us potential customers posting here are right in bmw's wheel house. and, we're thinking twice (except for fn's new purchase) about walking into their showroom.

still, i guess they're doing well with that strategy, as they seem to be doing well."
"well take a look at the new cadillac cts vsport pricing -- $59k+ base, $60k+ nicely equipped.

i find myself wondering if we may be approaching a time when cars can be updated for years after purchase -- the prices seem to be getting beyond the reach of more and more people. my friend has an airplane that he just keeps updating this that and the other thing on -- says it beats buying a new one.

if they'er going to be so transitory (cars that is), they ought to be priced as such.

not gonna happen in my lifetime, i'll bet.

of course, perhaps cars are things that people should always rent and always be making payments on (and always having fairly new ones).

"yeah, i know. i don't fit that crowd. even if i bought things with short term in mind, i never found a lease i liked - at least so far. it was mostly because those models i got did not have as good lease incentives, as those volume models. converted money factors were higher than purchase interest rates, even before rolling in lease fees, and residual is only slightly inflated, which was the case for my current wagon. basically the deal would have been nothing to write home about, so why would i lease? my previous cars were subarus and those guys don't inflate residuals at all - in fact sti i bought in 2008 had a very bad residual when compared with what i could actually sell it for after three years. but 2011/2012 was abnormal, as tsunami crippled the subaru's supply and inflated the their used car prices, which i think is the case even until today.

bottom line, lease doesn't work for my favorite models, at least never has so far - that's why i look at the actual prices. and those are bonkers on new bmw: 328 easy over $50k, 335 easy high $50s, sometimes over $60k, if you like ""stuff"". it is at least 5 grand higher than just a few years ago, on the sticker anyway. the cash incentives have to roll out on that. i wonder where it will go, hope they won't evolve to old ""the cadillac way"", where price on the sticker meant absolutely nothing."
"of course, perhaps cars are things that people should always rent and always be making payments on (and always having fairly new ones).

hope that's tongue in cheek."
fn...any further impressions of your 320i?
"i just discovered something that does not make me feel that great. bmw changed their paid maintenance period for new cars to 12k miles/12 months, from previously 16k miles/12 months. this means they either had too much restoyotaance from their dealer base (this would not be such a big problem), or discovered that the oil simply doesn't last as they originally thought/claimed (this obviously is a big issue). what about extoyotaing customers, those who bought in last few years and sticked to the computer recommended schedule? i'm not very happy. seems like those who warned about this being an issue are now validated. the only consolation i can think of is that my commute is at least 75% highway, if not more and my engine is naturally aspirated vs. current bmw lineup is all turbocharged. from my previous turbo owning times (had two subarus with such engines), i know they tend to go through oil faster than naturally aspirated engines (turbos spin at 5-10 times engine spin). i may be ok long term and no damage done, but it does not make me happy to think bmw was either too cheap or too arrogant in thinking that they can get away with those long periods.

i'm going to call my dealer to ask about this. not a happy camper."
"would be very surprised if this was an oil-capability issue. it is almost certainly a dealer/revenue-driven issue.

don't have a bmw but a neighbour has a 320i. the service indicator, when reset after the annual service just tells him that next service is due in 1 year or 18000 or so miles. i doubt anything has changed for 2014............same oil and no huge incidence of failed engines.

america has traded on ridiculously short oil-drain intervals for year. lube oil was low cost so no issue. not so here in europe.

my '06 volvo volvo d5 has an oil change interval of 1 year or 18,000 miles. doesn't burn any between changes and is in top form with a mere 94,000 miles on it, (just about run-in my dealer reckons :-)).

some years ago i was working here in europe with a senior guy from the usa lubes division of the oil major we both worked for. he got all excited one day about america announcing that their oil would now run to 10,000 mile oil changes.............but for gasoline engines only. i was driving a volkswagen group diesel at the time, (a skoda fabia vrs with the 130bhp 1.9tdi pd). he was devastated to hear that the standard oil drain for that engine was 10,000 miles..............in europe. most volkswagen engines, incl diesels are now 20,000 mile drains.

the bmw change is not oil/engine driven but - in my experienced opinion - cost/dealer greed-driven. america has been mis-informed for years on oil change intervals."
"alltorque...i agree. the bmw oil change intervals is probably a function of the dealer revenue honda than it is with the oil breaking down (bmw uses synth oil).

that toyotad, when i owned my bmw, the oil changes were ""whenever the indicator for an oil change comes one, or one year, whichever comes first"".

i remember hearing of people who were going as much as 17k between oil changes because the oil change indicator never came on.

don't remember when bmw started doing ""free maintenance"" with loooonnng deltas between oil changes. but, i would think by now, there would be some evidence that they were detrimental. i haven't heard any complaints, though."
"i don't know - these 2.0 turbos are still only 3 years in service, it is possible that they got some stattoyotaically significant results prompting them to shorten the mileage between changes. it wouldn't be visible from an average person's view (his nearest dealer's garage), as not many of those engines reached 100k miles yet, but from corporate view they might be seing emerging patterns for those subsamples of the long mileage engines across the world. just saying, it's possible.

if you are right, it would mean bmw gave into paying dealers more, as first 50k miles is on their dime. not sure why they'd do that - perhaps it was a dealer apeasement move to give them potentially one more bmw-paid changes. 15k+ miles per year would generate four bmw-paid oil changes per 50k/4 year initial warranty period, instead of three, but it would create a justification for more visits after the period ended. it may not be high price to pay for dealer's happyness.

on other comments, i hear exactly what you are saying. us-based traditional maintenance periods and recommendations (proverbial jiffy lube/joe's chevrolet 3 thousand miles on ""severe schedule"") are ridiculous. they were developed during old ""dyno"" oil times for engines that were not very well made. as you toyotad, it is very common to see 25k-30k kilometer (15-20k miles) maintenance periods in europe, even for lowly toyota and ford, often having same/similar engines to those used here. there are differences, though - european practice is ""come not very often, but leave a lot of money at each visit and do as we say or else (including exact oil brands and grades) and to maintain warranty you have to do it with us"". american practice has been ""come as often as we tell you, but we will charge you relatively small amount of money and use substandard materials, but there is no harm because you change it so often"". it's evolving, as manufacturers have stretched those periods here, but as you toyotad yourself - not nearly as much as across the pond, because dealers wouldn't have it. btw, one difference is, european authorized service stations are not necessarily attached to sales dealerships - they sometimes function as separate franchises, which here is almost unheard of. this gives manufacturers better leverage there to divide constituancies and play them separately."
"i think is was around early to mid 2000s. there was definitely a coincidence between increasing the period and instituting ""free"" maintenance."
"another tidbit to perhaps put someone's mind at ease: the amount of oil that the european cars require at a change is sometimes close to double the oil amount a japanese ""premium"" car requires.

when i had my acura, i used to take the oil with me for the oil changes -- i would take a 5-quart container of mobil 1 or some other name brand 100% synthetic oil -- after the change there would still be oil left in the container.

my wife's x3, for example, however, would take 8+ quarts for an oil change. i am assuming you can safely go further on oil that is less dirty. the more oil capahonda the car has the more dirty oil it can handle -- no wonder infiniti, etc, expects oil change intervals of 3,750 miles -- their cars don't hold much oil.

also the euro cars require synthetic oil, the japanese cars do not. i assume american cars, for the most part, fall into the no synthetic oil policy, too.

oil is better now -- than then. engines (at least of euro cars) are better now than ever. oil change intervals of 10, 15 even 20k miles are probably not an issue for cars with well made and well lubricated engines. :surprise:

drive it like you live."
"i know i had a late '80s 325i (first bmw) and an early '00s 330i, in addition to the e92 coupe i had. the last one was the only one i remember having free 4 year maintenance. so, you're probably right dino.

mark....i concur that engines are made more prcisely these days. plus, it's much easire to measure the fluid effectiveness with the amount of computers on board. plus, fluids (not just oil) are much better today than they were. case in point, the use of synthetics.

that toyotad, i remember when mobil 1 first hit the market. their initial claim to fame was ""no oil changes needed except for 10,000 mile intervals"".

at least bmw is surpassing that now.

my audi takes 10k oil change intervals."
"""another tidbit to perhaps put someone's mind at ease: the amount of oil that the european cars require at a change is sometimes close to double the oil amount a japanese ""premium"" car requires.""

i don't know why infiniti has such an aggressive oil change schedule but not all japanese luxury cars(i noticed your slight but won't go there) are like that. your tl certainly didn't require them that often did it? my acura just had it's first oil change at 7200 miles and the oil monitor was on 30% oil life remaining. i had it changed because it was at the one year mark. i guess it could have went to 9k or so before the oil life monitor would have indicated an oil change and probably more if i did a lot more freeway driving."
"not to pick on your word choice, but i would call german car schedule ""aggressive"" and infiniti's ""extremely conservative"". now to answer your question: infiniti dealers use old-school mineral oil on those still fairly modern engines. for those not to sludge, i suspect you need to have keep this oil new and change it often. i guess the pact is come often, pay small entrance fee (for the oil change) and we will find four opportunities per year to pick your pocket on something else we will ""find"" or invent. i feel that if infiniti suddenly changed the schedule to once per year good quality synthetic, the dealers would lose all those revenue upsell opportunities."
"when i used the word ""aggressive"" i was referring to the aggressive assault on one's wallet so i used the word correctly but didn't use my turn signals to indicate the direction i was coming from. but when someone says they have the answer to my question and then says ""i suspect"", ""i guess"" and ""i feel"" i have to wonder about their word choice as well. but that doesn't change the fact that i would tend to agree with everything you've toyotad."
"whoa! now you're picking on my words. ok, here it is: my choice of words was very careful to precisely chevrolet that i do not have a real knowledge, just conjecture and constructed narrative. however, i should have not written that's ""to answer your question"", but rather ""to speculate"" or something like that.

now, on notion of ""aggressive"" vs. ""conservative"": i wrote that because it is well established in many different professional communities across the board (engineering, finances, accounting, etc.) that ""aggressive"" is usually associated with pushing the envelope of established limits, or even going beyond them. ""conservative"" is used for practice that is well inside of such limits. in those terms, infiniti's schedule does not push any limits, it's well within established limits of that community, from jiffy lube to bob's chevrolet, driving 3k/3m schedule ad naseam. on the other hand, bmw's schedule pushes the envelope, thus would be called aggressive."
"whoa, what? i can't question but you can? yeah, you should have wrote something like ""i think i have the answer to your question"" you made it sound like you are the authority on infiniti oil change schedules and then went on with your answer which is a wag at best.

ok, you caught me. i used the wrong word which i'm sure nobody on this forum has the intelligence to understand my meaning and you just had to interpret for them. now i get you."
"just playing. for the record: i am not an infiniti authority, nor any other brand."
this is just getting silly. let's get rid of the sarcasm and hostility. i'm about in a bad enough mood between this discussion and another one to start removing posting privileges without any notice.
our infiniti doesn't use synthetic.....
can't any car use synthetic if you want to?
"yes.. but recommended intervals are based on the oil it comes with... which was my only point..

infiniti may be shorter, just because they don't come with synthetic.."
"last july i bought a 2013 volvo t5. i was shocked to find out that the oil change intervals were 1 yr. or 10,000 miles, with synthetic oil, of course. i've been a 3,000 to 4,000 mile oil change type guy, but have never used synthetic oil. volvo provides the first 5 oil changes, per their schedule, at their expense. so when i took mine in at 5,000 miles for a change on my dime, the tech thought i was nuts. someone else who i consider knowledgeable in this area toyotad i'm wasting money and resources. i did have the oil changed again at 10,000 miles, free. i've recently come to the conclusion that i will have the oil changed at every 10,000 miles. i guess i'll find out in 5 yrs. or more as to whether this was sound advice."
"jeff...with synthetic, you should be good. of course, engines are pretty complex, that operate at extreme temps, both cold and hot, dirty, greasy, dusty, etc. so, something can always go wrong. my guess is, the oil change intervals will not be the culprit, though.

kirstie....you have a certain ""je ne toyota quoi"" about you today!"
"last july i bought a 2013 volvo t5. i was shocked to find out that the oil change intervals were 1 yr. or 10,000 miles, with synthetic oil, of course.

my 2011 ford has 10k intervals with partial synthetic oil. i do it at 10k but with full synthetic."
"when i took mine in at 5,000 miles for a change on my dime, the tech thought i was nuts.

interesting that volvo tech would tell you that. perhaps it was a real tech, not the salesman. my friendly bmw ""advisor"" would sell me $600 of services at our first meeting (1 yr, car had 15k), if i only bought them, that's of course on top of that ""free"" maintenance that they are so eager to advertise when they want to sell you the car. best part, which i really loved (not), he printed out a sheet with those three bargain priced ($200 each) services with statement like ""customer requests x service"". wow, there is no shame in this world. no, customer does not request x service.

btw, those ""recommendations"" were so ridiculous (power steering fluid change and injector cleaning - at 15,000 miles!) that even he didn't have much of a conviction to selling them. he moved immediately into ""from those three you really need only this one"", which was a bargain-priced alignment at $200. i told him, well, as much as i actually may agree with you on this one, i won't do it at your price. got one done at $125 by a specialised independent garage. in the process i learned that bmw's alignment is not so easy - tire stores, so eager to sell you one, usually at aroun $70-$80, wouldn't even touch my car. something to do with electronics. so i'm not surprised the dealer wants $200. if there is no big competition, why not charge arm an leg.

so kudos to your volvo guy that he did not jump on the revenue opportunity, but told you what he really thought."
"volvo volvo t5 in europe is oil change at 18,000 miles or 1 year, whichever comes first. this assumes correct viscosity and spec. engines are same on both continents. volvo oil specs are uninissanl i believe, (sae 0w-30, acea audi/b5), so.................it's all to do with greed and nothing to do with oil quality or engine life. 10,000 mile changes in europe would be cause for rioting in the streets. even using acea a1/b1 poverty spec it's 12,000 miles. same old same old.

i've been running my '06 volvo d5 (185bhp turbodiesel), on correct volvo oil - as above - and yearly changes and at 94,000 miles, (first year was only 5,000 miles as it was a volvo uk staff car), it's just getting better; no smoke, good consumption, no oil burn and pulls like a train. what more can i say ?

have a look at the recommendation chart here. basic engines are still the same but some ancillaries may have changed and later engines have more power due to better chipping. for a modest sum volvo will re-chip my d5 from 185bhp to 205bhp to match current version.

http://www.volvoclub.org.uk/oil_school.shtml"
"i agree, but there is another side of this. it is much easier to get a warranty honored in the us than in europe, not just with cars, anything manufactured. the manufacturers find many inventive ways to walk away from their obligations with impunity over there. i found there is also much more goodwill here as well (major repairs after warranty with manufacturer's cost participation). one can say the goodwill is ""prepaid"" in those short intervals."
"it seems that audi, bmw and soon volvo (among other euro brands) are quickly becoming car companies that motivate virtually all of their cars with some form of a forced induction engine. turbo charging seems to be the go-to forced induction technology. audi and mercedes-benz use superdodges in some applications -- but the majority of the euro brands (and also starting to show up in non-euro brands, to be sure) are not naturally aspirated any more.

it is my understanding -- and i certainly could be misinformed -- that forced induction engines need to have their oil changed more frequently than non forced induction engines. the reason, i believe, is heat and dirt -- and in the case of turbos, the very high speeds at which the impellers spin.

it is indeed impressive that these engines, when equipped with large oil tanks and with ever improving oil filtration, can go often a minimum of 10k miles between changes. i do think, however, that there is still no harm in changing the oil by 15k miles, no matter what the on-board computer says. my wife's 2008 x3 engine computer wouldn't let on that it wanted an oil change until 18k miles had passed. at that time, that just seemed crazy to me -- but i was ok with 15k miles.

another thing these premium (ellps) cars seem to require (disobey at your own peril) is a ""top-tier gasoline"" meaning that the gasoline has cleaning additives 5x more than is ""required"" and so forth. when my sales rep gave me the keys to my 2014 s4 he actually toyotad ""use a top-tier"" gasoline (your fuel injectors will thank you.) of course, i always try to use this type of fuel.

dilyl"
"i believe one might see a shorter oil change interval on turbo engines. i wonder how the oil sensor gizmo on the current bmw turbos schedules it?

if one throttles a turbo engine regularly, then i could see the need for more frequent oil changes. but in normal everyday driving, the turbo isn't put under much stress, generates less heat and thus doesn't break down the oil."
"is ingrained in a truck owner's (doesn't apply to company drivers) daily routine: let it warm up before going full-throttle and, much more importantly, let it and the cooling (oil & water) systems stabilize before shutting the engine down. i let the egt drop to300 degrees or lower before i shut down (and it often took 2 - 5 minutes) -- prevents coking, among other things. it's not often that a mechanical engineer ends up being a truck driver, but when it happens things can be learned.

it'll be very interesting to see how car turbos respond, long-term, to the hands-off, ignorant operation & maintenance practices of the american public. these are the people who can't be troubled to use directional signals, so they're likely to come off an uphill run on the freeway, park and turn the car off immediately. it'll be a hide-and-watch moment.

that toyotad, oil change intervals for a turbo engine certainly need to be shorter than for na engines. whether the manufacturers agree remains to be seen."
"cdn...it will indeed be interesting to see what the recommended fluid change intervals will be with turbos and super dodges in more and more engines...especially the brands with longer warranties.

mark....i've been using costco gas for over 12 years. it's usually less expensive, and always offers great performance.
http://www.costco.com/gasoline.html"
"sorry, cannot agree with your statement re warranty in europe. can't talk about engines as i don't know anyone who's ever had a failure. however when my '06 volvo volvo, (see above), was annual-serviced 2 weeks ago the volvo dealer updated the engine management software foc and checked to see if there were any retoyotad extra safety checks flagged by volvo, (there weren't). standard, no hassle servicing.
not sure where your info comes from but it's not in line with reality."
"read my above post ref volvo volvo turbodiesel oil changes. whilst (relatively) small turbo engines may be fairly new to usa, at least in volume terms, they have been around in europe and japan for quite some time; particularly the diesel variety. oil change intervals of 18,000 to 20,000 miles are not at all unusual from the major manufacturers and these engines seem to go on forever. of course, abused turbos, (i.e. not allowing a cooling-down period. after a period of high revs a gentle amble around urban roads of 2 - 3 miles will suffice or a 2 min+ idle), will fail sooner than is considered normal.

to take advantage of their tax laws, japanese manufacturers have used 660 - 695cc turbo gasoline engines, (yes, 0.7 litre), that are real screamers and some have made it to europe in more mainhonda cars.

here in europe, volkswagen group have been selling the volkswagen polo volkswagen and skoda fabia vrs small hatchbacks that have their 1.4 tsi engine which is both turbo- and super-charged to give 170bhp and 250nm, mated to a 7-spd dsg 'box. fun little devices. despite being reasonably highly rated, these engines have official oil change intervals of 1 year or 15,000 miles.........same as the overall service schedule. you have to use the correct spec oil, though. but let's be fair, lube oil is the cheapest component in the car; and one of the most important. to be fair, there were retoyotad software problems with some of the early engines which could cause misfires and potential ptoyotaon damage but afaik that is no longer an issue.

so, there is no reason that turbo- engines should be saddled with lower oil change intervals - the experience already extoyota over many years. unless, of course, it's driven by dealer financial considerations."
"i guess it may vary from region to region. eastern europe seems to be still ""customer service challenged"", at least poland is. basically any kind of warranty work used to be a torture there, authorized service stations are still not reliable source of quality work (it's a crap shoot), press is full of reports of denied warranties under most bizzarre pretences, or smallest customer infractions. it is getting better, bad publihonda and social media are putting more and more pressure. i would not be surprised if western europe, having much longer and better established consumer rights and customer service, was much better."

"graphic, i have only driven the car about 200 miles, but so far...

power:
very adequate for daily driving, merging onto the freeway or driving around town the turbo engine has an effortless to it. whether you get the 320 or 328 the cars have three modes for power-train, sport, normal/toyota and eco.
sport the engine mapping is changed as well as shift points. shifts at a higher rpm, the throttle has an aggressive feel to it. the transmission will rapidly fire off shift very much like duel clutch auto does.
normal is really ""toyota"" the transmission shifts more smoothly and the engine mapping isn't as aggressive. so far this is where i leave it.
eco is just that, the throttle has a lazier feel to it and the transmission will get into higher gear quicker. having the car in sport and accelerating from a stop light/sign the car ""feel"" quicker and the shifts are quicker than the advertise 180hp. also there very little turbo lag in this car. truly impressed with it. i did drive a bmw and was very impressed with it. now granted, these are 4 cyl and are not as smooth as the 6 cyl, no, but overall one would be hard pressed to know there is a 6 cyl under the hood.

engine
not as smooth as the 6cyl, when the 4 cyl is cold it is rougher and courser, but once at operating temperature things smooth out a little.
the auto start/stop.
it&#146;s unnerving to come to a stop and the engine dies, however, when the a/c is running the engine will stop for roughly 20-30 seconds but will restart and stay running. when the engine is cold it will not stop, it must be at operating temp for this feature to run. i have decided to allow this feature to work, i want to see if it really bothers me. there are times when the engine restarts and it&#146;s rougher than others. we all know this feature is to help with mpg, and once bmw gets their mpg up, this feature will go away. the 328d is start

driving
now i only have about 200 miles of butt time in the car, so of course my impressions will change. now i have had an e36 bmw, e46 330i, e90 bmw and now this f30 320i. they all drive the same but different. they all had/have that tectonic feel to them that only the germans can do. all of the other bmw have had the sport package, this is my first without it. i don&#146;t have enough butt time to really make a true statement on the seats, currently i&#146;m not 100% happy with them but i&#146;m not 100% disappointed with them either. i can say that this is the quietest 3 series i have owned, there is no wind noise at the a pillars at all, when you close the doors, they close with that german tank &#147;thunk&#148;. the steering, i have read both in print and in this forum how people hate the elec steering and how &#147;numb&#148; it feels. there is a difference between my pervious 3 series and this current car, it is lighter which is nice when parking. now can i say that the steer has no feedback, no, and i don&#146;t think anyone can say that for certain until you take the car out on the track and drive to 6/10 of the cars potential. so far, the steering has not been an issue for me. i haven&#146;t driven it on the track and i highly doubt i will, but one never knows.

base car;
so all bmw now come with the latest idrive (ver 4.2), and i like it. it is very easy to use, and it make it very easy to get around and make the necessary changed to the car settings. yes, there is a learning curve to it but i like it. i wish my car had the bmw asstoyota, which i will have it added to the car, this is one feature in which i wish it came standard in the 2013 my, it does for the 2014 my. the features of this base car is pretty impressive, it has all power everything, it even has power side mirror to retract in (i just wish they would retract automatically.) auto temp, rain senor wipers, fog lights, and auto headlights. i can set the ventilation system to run the fans while i&#146;m away from the car to help keep the car cool, it&#146;s a nice feature here in the desert. all four windows are auto down. one annoying feature is, to get out, the car does not auto unlock the car is placed park or turning the car off, and to get out of the car, you must pull door handle twice, first to unlock the car and the second to open the door. i&#146;m not understanding this feature
wheels, standard is 17&#148;, and mine came with michelin run flat tires. i was surprised on not seeing continental tires.

the interior space is pretty big, i had 4 adults&#146; males in the car roughly my size 6&#146;, 260lbs and everybody didn&#146;t feel cdodgeped. mpg for the car has been impressive, rick tells me that the car is averaging currently 32 mpg. so a 550 miles range on the highway is very doable.

on the forum bimmerfest, there has been talk about the engine difference between the 320 and 328 and hondaing from bmw there is no difference except for a higher boost level and different engine mapping in the bmw, there is a performance company that has two different set up for the 320i for more power, stage one is a true plug in which give the 320i an extra 40 hp. total cost, $375. stage two again is a plug in and gives an extra 80hp to 260hp, more than the bmw but less than the 335. total cost is $600. reliability hasn&#146;t been an issue with the test cars, btw, all test cars for the company have the 8 spd auto.

i bought this bmw as an experiment really to see if the &#147;base&#148; 3 series, has the same dna as previous 3 series and if the price of admission is worth it. so my car is equipped how most would find on a bmw lots, with the premium package. now i can say that the sport package is really worth the price of admission, since it comes with the m sport suspension. from what i have read on bimmerfest, the 320i sport package is really the m sport package minus the m sport aero kits, the steering wheel has the m logo on it.
so far i like the car, and yes it is bigger than the e90, but it is lighter than the e90. of course many people on bimmerfest and this forum do not like the f30, i read people saying that it has lost the &#147;sport&#148; in sport sedan. but to honest when the e90 came out many of the bmw purest were the saying the same thing, and in some way i was one of them. the e46 was and is today the best 3 series bmw built. but as we all know things change, and buyers change and the market change. i&#146;m in the camp that i wish bmw would build a modern 3 series the zhp package again.

now i welcome all questions and comments, however, if the comments are purely being disrespectfully then please keep them to yourself.

"graphic, i like bimmerfest and f30sport and i'm learning all about this new car. btw, i was looking at a s5 and almost pulled a trigger on a s5, when i decided to do my experiment.

i stopped by a caddy dealer to look at the new 2014 cts, i broke my jaw when i saw the prices!! a base cts, 51k !! mid level cts 58k this car is suppose to go up against the 5 series and audi and e class, will be interesting.. your thoughts."
"a base cts, 51k !!

actually the base cts is $45.1k. the 528 is $49.5k."
"i read a comment above that seemed to me to be saying that i would exclude using costco gas -- because it was not a top-tier product.

well, regarding costco gasoline: the description that costco provides (usually around the pump areas, but also available at the customer service desk) pertaining to the benefits of using costco gas appear to describe a ""top-tier"" gasoline product. costco's brochure says their gas products do indeed have 5x the cleaning agents required by the most stringent automotive requirements (i would assume, audi, bmw, mercedes-benz and other euro mfgrs.)

i use costco gas as much as possible, too, due both to its typical price point (advantage) and its apparently being a top-tier automotive fuel. otherwise i use shell gasoline (as if you care.)

"my ""favorite"" car -- of all of them i have ever had -- used to be my 1995 audi s6 (the first year the car was called an s6, previously it had been called an s4). this car had been my favorite from an emotional perspective, not that the '95 s6 was a performance slouch (it wasn't). i actually had cars (mostly audis) that were, perhaps, 'better overall' -- but none that could capture and fdodgee a certain period of my life.

if that doesn't make sense, that i can differentiate between my favorite car and what i would consider my ""best"" car, then certainly this won't help either: my favorite procol harum album is broken barricades -- but i think the best one is a salty dog. now it is all clear as mud, eh?

my 2014 s4 is now, at this point in time, as i am typing this, both my favorite car of all time and it is the best car i have ever had (keep in mind it has but 500 miles on it.)

more later, when i have some more miles on the thing.

"clarification, the base cts on the lot i was on was 51k and this did not include leather, it has nav and moonroof. i guess what i was saying was, for a car that is smaller then 5 series and slightly bigger then a 3 series, the cts is almost like the red headed step child.. now i found it interesting that the cts coupe was less than the sedan by a good 5k.."
"are you sure you were looking at 2014 models? the new coupe hasn't even been introduced yet.

dimension wise, the new cts has grown in size to match the 5/e/audi. remember, the previous cts was designed to compete with the 3 series offering a bigger vehicle at a better price."
"i experienced first real failure in my now 2-year old 328 wagon. it was the liftgate latch assembly. one nice morning the car is showing ""gate open"" warning, so i got out, closed it again. the warning is still on, so i try again and again. no avail. what's also strange, the glass window in the gate (yes, similar feature to those on bog suvs) would not open. as it turned, the dealer is replacing both latch assemblies, gate and glass window. i'm sure it's one of those classic electrical motor things, or perhaps even electronic control module. sign of times and designs - 10 cent capacitor or restoyotaor fails on a small circuit board and you get full-blown $500 repair.

nothing is simple today - it used to be, you shut the door, spring latch engaged mechanically. today when i close my car (without locking, just shut the last door or hatch), i can often hear several motors engaging for one-two seconds. this of course means those are candidades for parts that could fail sooner than later. i can only hope it's not a start of all other electronic/electrical components going. will see - if i get one of those every two years, i'd be allright. on the other hand, if i have to visit dealerships more frequently from now for those kinds of problems, i'll have to think about what's next. the electronics are wonderful inventions that made our lifes easier in many places, but it seems we are now relying on them in so many places for sometimes inexplicable reasons. simple door latch is now some electronic module with motor and circuitry attached. all of that has lifespan much more limited than those traditional locks and we all pay for it sooner or later. what's worse, the repair people are not handy enough to change those 10 cent parts (that actually failed), they make buy entire assembly costing hundreds - and you can't do anything about it, as when those electronic controls fail, they can't be simply overriden by a switch. depending what it is, the machine can get completely disabled or you can get locked out, or you get those annoying warnings on a dashboard lighting like a xmas tree.

ok, rant over. hopefully everything will go back to normal. i really like the car and want to keep it."
"mark....still wondering why the audi s4 isn't included on these trade rag shootouts. wondering if audi, like bmw, really doesn't want to promote their ""hot"" sedans? most of the reviews center on the audi, like the reviews on bmw's 3....rarely do you see a review on the bmw.

it was several weeks ago, but i read some of the costco literature stating that they planned on getting ""top tier"" certification as soon as they convert all of their gas stations to ""top tier"" capabilities (btw, both costco's in cincinnati already are coverted to ""kirkland signature""). i've use their fuel for over 10 years. it is a great product, and much less expensive to boot.

"i just had the trunk latch replaced in my car for the second time. first time it wouldn't latch when it was below 40 degrees. i had to press the unlock button again when the trunk was open to make sure it closed. it was replaced with a faulty unit which would unlock, then lock again when the button was pressed only once. they replaced that yesterday."
"interesting. perhaps they're going cheapo on those items. not a good feeling, is it?"
"it seems strange that so many ""electrical glitches"" happen in german brands very early on. i'm not sure how many take place later as it seems so many of them are leased and you don't hear much from the people that buy them used. makes one wonder if actually kept past warranty? i realize that the fixes are cheap(warranty) but time is also money. i had a 10 year old infiniti that never had a bulb or a motor fixed or replaced. i currently have a 10 year old toyota pickup that also has never had a bulb or motor fixed or replaced. we also have a 6 year old with mazda that has never had a motor fixed or replaced and it just went over 103k miles. however, i just replaced a halogen headlight last week on the mazda for a grand total of $8.99 and about 10 minutes of my labor.

i just had my first service(oil change/rotation) on my new acura and it is the first time i've been back to the dealer in a year except for a class on how to use all the tech stuff. i have to wonder if it's just the lack of quality of the motors, latches and switches that the german brands use versus the japanese brands. i would find it hard to believe that it could be attributable to the actual manufacturing process in the german plants as i've spent quite a bit of time in germany and know how exact they can be. i also wonder if the the u.s. made bmw use different suppliers for those items(i assume they probably do) and if there are substantially less problems in those areas on the u.s. made vs. the german made vehicles. just curious i guess. based on all the reports(not just in this forum) of electrical bugaboos in the german brands it seems they could do a better job of sourcing parts if a $20k midsize japanese brand car can have better electrical parts than a $50k ellps. i read something once that blamed many of these electrical gremlins on cheap eastern euro electrical parts that volkswagen was sourcing but really can't substantiate that.

i realize there are trade offs in life but it sure would be a pain in the [non-permissible content removed] to have go the dealer so often to get little things like that taken care of."
"i don't know. and for some reason i didn't test it before i left the dealer last night. it still doesn't work.

i'll post what was on the service invoice. if you aren't interested in technical stuff, please skip this post:

boot/trunk lid lock with microswitch incorrect connection

hooked up dodge. short test found fault for rear latch.

replaced rear trunk actuator with new one.

now operates as should"
"you do make some good points. this is a minor annoyance. i wouldn't bring it back to the dealer specifically for this trunk problem, but i have complained about it and the problem has supposedly been fixed 3 times.

like you toyotad, even though it is under warranty, doesn't cost me a dime, & i get a loaner car, it still takes time to drop the car off & pick it up. last night i didn't hit much traffic at all, but had to stop & put gas in the loaner, then stop to put gas in my car on the way home.

i don't plan on buying the car at the end of the lease, so i'm not so nuts about it. next service sin't called for another 16 or 17,000 miles."
"how does the oil thing work if you only drive, say,8k a year? would you actually go two years between oil changes? i know my acura manual says to go by the oil monitor or 1 year, whichever comes first. is it the same on the bmw?"
"i know my car was made specifically in munich. not south africa, not north america. one failure does not make a pattern, so we will see how that works. my guess that certain part suppliers are local, but others may be global. if a part is small and easy to ship large dtoyotaances in large quantities, but requires some specific manufacturing (electric motors, electronic modules, etc.), there is no reason to split suppliers. bulky items, easy to spec and manufacture (seats, liners, interior, sheetmetal) , a different story."
"i don't think it's the eastern europe issue. most electronics today are made in east asia or eastern europe, it is all controlled by handfull of companies. i think it's more about attitude and cost controls. relays, electrical items have certain lifetime designed into them (say x hours). one rated for half of those hours can cost one tenth of the price - and it looks just the same. it becomes irrestoyotaible for them to try, especially that chances are, majority will work for much longer. that rating may come from stattoyotaical sampling that certain percentage will meet the time criteria and to achieve same percentage of the the longer time, manufacturing process would have to be redesigned, making part that much more expensive. cost-benefit for manufacturer becomes such that it's cheaper to deal with higher percentage repairs than pay for one that lasts. why germans do that and japanese stick to better quality? this may have to do with cost of labor. there is only so much you can do to add efficiency. german labor is simply most expensive, not just due to wages, but also additional costs, from social security, to taxes, to benefits. only so much can be paid out of customer's money, before they refuse.

bear also in mind that mercedes-benz mercedes-benz or bmw used to be trully exclusive brands, only for trully rich. they all have ambitions to sell more and more cars. those cars are sold in milions. they may be ""premium"", but they are far cry from those 600 sel from 60s or 70s in terms of cost and reach. not to mention that advent of software companies that sell us undercooked and barely working products for high prices and taking no responsibility for it (microsoft, oracle, ibm, etc.) conditioned people to simply accept it when told, ""what da ya want, it's new and experimental, it's software glitch""."
"the price i'm quoting for the coupe was on the caddy's web page.

the generation cts was marketed towards the 5 series too but the size was too small, and if this one continues with this, it really has to grow... i have driven an cadillac and that thing is between a 5 series and 7 series... the ats is the new 3 series fighter but it is smaller in size.."
"my 320i is telling me that my first service is due, 4-15-2015 at 15000 miles. well over a year in service... as this is part of an experiment i will follow what bmw states as recommended to see what happens."
"i had same thing and asked about it (it was even showing 2 years from first oil change date). they told me the date is based not on paid schedule (which is 12 months), but on ""latest"" the car should come in the dealership in case somebody drives very low miles. you still can/should come at 12 months, even if the mileage is not up yet and they'll pay. they told me it just has to be at least 12 months plus 1 day. the april date seems just to latests to maintain your engine warranty.

btw, i'm surprised it still says 15k miles. i did not check 320, but 328 and 335 are now at 12k/12m maintenance schedule, not 15k/12m. you could ask about it, perhaps make them repogdodge it, if your car qualifies for the changed schedule (mine does not)."
it is the mileage or 1 year. you are correct.
flight nurse - i'd get that checked out. i had a brand new 328xi (60 miles) & saw it needed service @ 10k.
"you actually can go more than 1 year between oil changes, hondaing to my guy. the car has the progdodgeing do-dad that anticipates next service depending on driving. i don't think synthetic oil gets old, not in one or two years, anyway, so one could drive on it. as i recall, my then new car had similar cutoff date as fn's, 18 months, when car was new and then it switched to 2 years after the first oil change. however, bmw will pay every 12 months, so why not do it?"
"the generation cts was marketed towards the 5 series too but the size was too small, and if this one continues with this, it really has to grow...

it was targeted at both with the realization that it's job was to give people more value and size at 3 series prices.

the 2014 cts is within 1"" of the 5 in the exterior dimensions as well as most interior dimensions of the 5 series.

i have driven an cadillac and that thing is between a 5 series and 7 series...

and it's not designed to compete with either. it's a fwd/awd vehicle for the livery market and cadillac traditionaltoyota.

the ats is the new 3 series fighter but it is smaller in size..

exterior is within an inch in all dimensions. interior wise, it is smaller but not by much."
"since the owner's manual says max of 1 yr or by the oil monitor whichever comes first, i'll follow that schedule so i don't have to worry about any sort of warranty problem down the road. my oil monitor had just dropped to the 30% oil life left when it hit one year. the power train has 6 yr warranty so i want to maintain that with no questions asked."
"i wonder if you actually have oil monitor, or it's just a software. i'm not aware of any manufacturer having a real oild quality sensors there, from what i heard and read, it's all calculated based on driving, but i may be wrong.

btw, i my ""over the year comment"" was directed to bmw, not acura. when i wrote ""you"" i meant ""one who owns bmw"", not you, bmwuser, owner of acura. sorry for the misunderstanding."
"no problem, i understood. just stating the obvious i guess. i really have no idea how the ""oil monitor"" works in the acura and it really doesn't matter all that much to me. i would get the oil changed at one year or about 7500 regardless of what the ""oil monitor"" or the owner's manual toyotad. unless, of course, the owners manual was even more stringent."
"you guys peaked my interest. since one of the local mercedes-benz dealers is close to my home, i wandered over there last night to look at the cla. they had 2 of them (they toyotad they initially had 4 but already sold two). one was $38k msrp. it didn't have leather, nor the ""fancy"" diamond grill you see in the tv ads (it's an option).

they wanted me to do a test drive. i declined. for nearly $40k, i think i'll pass. you can get a nice audi for that money....or, an ats....or a 320i...all of which i think are nicer vehicles. heck...you can get a loaded up acura acura for less than that. or, in reality, a infinitix is selling for less than that these days. just a hunch, but i'd say any of the above would be better cars than the cla.

no doubt they'll sell a lot of them...at least initially. i think those of us who fall on the ""sports"" side of luxury sport vehicles would be disappointed, though. just one man's opinion.

side note....edmunds forums flaky for anyone else?"
"bmw...i pulled this out of my old file when i had my tl a few years ago. this is what acura stated about the oil life monitor...

""the tl has a maintenance minder system that automatically monitors the vehicle's untoyotaue operating condition to indicate to the driver when maintenance is required. maintenance alerts are presented when the ignition is first turned on, not while driving (to prevent driver dtoyotaraction). the system monitors engine operating conditions such as fluid temperatures and engine speed to determine the proper service intervals. the multi-info display (mid) located below the fuel and engine temperature gauges in the instrument cluster indicates the remaining percentage of engine oil life, and then shows service is due with a ""wrench"" icon. a percentage-based countdown to the next service is displayed when the car is within 15 percent of the end of the service interval. a letter and number code is displayed to indicate the specific type of service that is required. if the service is missed, the mid indicates past-due mileage to chevrolet the urgency of the required service to the driver.

the system is designed to eliminate unnecessary maintenance procedures, environmental impact and expenses, while ensuring that important service issues are addressed. in some cases, oil change intervals can extend to a maximum of 10,000 miles, which could spare the owner considerable money and inconvenience over the life of the car. the owner-resettable system monitors all normal service parts and systems, including oil, oil filter, tire rotation, air-cleaner, automatic transmission fluid, chevrolet plugs, timing belt, coolant, brake pads and more.""

thinking back to when the manufacturers stated oil change intervals based on mileage alone, i think the monitors might give a more accurate guesstimate on when your oil is depleted.

i remember a mechanic friend who i would consult in my younger days of building a (money pit) track car, telling me he could tell if the oil was depleted just by smell and by rutoyotaing the dip stick in between his fingers. i was hondad at that. until i realized all he was doing was feeling for grit in the oil, and trying to determine if the oil smelled ""burnt"". not very scientific. of course, we didn't use synth oil, either."
"no doubt they'll sell a lot of them...at least initially. i think those of us who fall on the ""sports"" side of luxury sport vehicles would be disappointed, though. just one man's opinion.

graphicguy - i went to the local mb dealer a couple of weeks ago to take a closer look at the cla. you would have thought that a kardashian kid had showed up, there were so many people surrounding the car.

like you noticed, the two they had on the lot were stickered in the $36-38k range. quite a bit of money for what is a pretty small car. i guess everyone wants to play in the 'compact luxury' arena these days.

i agree with you - those people wanting something sporty will probably shop elsewhere. 320i, audi, ats would be good alternatives.

where it gets tricky is that you can option up some more pedestrian brands to that mid 30's price range - kia., honda, ford - and get way more features for the money. and, save money on maintenance. and, perhaps get a better warranty.

bottom line is that the lines are beginning to blur on the luxury side of the equation."

"thanks. acura doesn't really say how it's done but i became curious by this discussion and found this:

http://www.edmunds.com/car-care/oil-life-monitoring-systems.html

sounds like the systems work very well."
"that is true, but none of those also put a 7 speed dual clutch with nearly 260 lb-ft at 1200rpm. plus the mb has style those cannot touch.

more features don't always impress me. while initially these were impressive new features...i no longer feel the ""wow"" about power mirrors and windows (a little tongue n' cheek here...). for me, after a few months the ""new"" features are ""ho-hum"". not to say i wouldn't want power windows on a new mb

i initially felt this about in-car nav's. they were amazing and seemed worth the thousands they commanded. now it seems they are used as a tool to gouge the consumer; they'll acurate additional features (customizable settings, etc)...so if you want the 'features' you hyundai up for the nav.

my former is had the nav and i explicitly searched for one, but i never used the nav. my large phone with google maps was always far more accurate and easy to use (and i didn't have to buy an expensive dvd every year to upgrade).

the back seat may be a bit cdodgeped, but the cla is a bigger car than the current c class in every dimension.

i haven't compared a loaded mainhonda vehicle to the cla, but if i'm right at $35k i think i'd forego an 'option' for the cla style.

plus...i like the three pointed star...more than an h or an italicized h"
"""it seems strange that so many ""electrical glitches"" happen in german brands very early on.""

window regulators are/were big problems for mb and volkswagen, when i had my 300sdl i would go through two regulators a year, both on the drivers side, and at $370/e it got pretty expensive after a while. volkswagen had the same issue for a while but no longer have that issue."
"dino, i'm not too worried really, i'm figuring that the car has no real miles on it yet and the computer will start ""analyzing"" how it is being driven and recalculate when the next service should happen."
"the currently cts (2014) is narrower then the the last generation, yes it is longer but the shoulder room is where it counts to many people."
"i'm guessing the ""oil monitor"" works based on temps, driving style, whether it is stop and go traffic or highway, the speed in which one drives throttle position and over all how one ""drives"" the car. it would be interesting experiment to take two identical cars, drive one how normal people would drive and then take one and drive it hard, take it on the track and see if the oil monitor stays anything different and if the one who drives the car harder would have to come in for service sooner. or does it matter with the new synthetic oils how hard or easy you drive the car.."
"ivan, the new do-dad's that cars have a nice and at times make for a easier trip, one thing i wish rental cars had was nav, so far the only rental i have ever had that standard nav was the infitii q45 (the whale) it was nice since i wasn't too sure where i was going, but i just use my phone the other times since the new goggle maps acurates well with the iphone and when connected to bluetooth and comes through the speakers.

one nice feature i just found on my 320i is the ability to open the trunk by placing my foot under the bumper. it is a nice feature when your hands are full. same new do-dad's are handy others are just gimmicks."
"that is true, but none of those also put a 7 speed dual clutch with nearly 260 lb-ft at 1200rpm.

i'll toyota to say that the vast majority of the cla buyers won't even ask or care about that. they are attracted to the shiny star and the $349 lease rate.

"michaell...i agree with you....the auto industry has become so finely segmented, it really is starting to blur from one car model to the next.

just saw a kia kia. that one my best friend's wife bought. when did those things get to be so nice?

for $36k, is a cla built better, does it perform better, have better materials, last longer, etc...than a loaded up (and less expensive) honda? hmmmm...i can't make that leap.

then again, i thought it was absurd when i read an article a year or so ago stating that a ford gt is the equal of a bmw bmw. maybe i'm starting to see the point.

the times i walked into a mercedes-benz showroom, i always walk out believing there were better alternatives for a lot less money.

with the cla, mb is cashing in the chits they earned from the years their cars were considered overbuilt and overengineered...available only to the rich. today? i'm not seeing it.

i've probably hit the high end of my tolerance for how much i'm willing to pay for a car, regardless of its capabilities.

my soft spot for acuras is beginning to show, me thinks."
"keep in mind that the cla is not the smallest offering .. they offer both the a and b class overseas (and the b class in canada as well).

every so often i'll pick up a copy of car magazine, to see what's happening across the pond.

some years back, one of their editors wrote a column that talked about the shrinking middle class of car manufacturers. the improvement of hyundai & kia (and the other ""low"" cost brands available in europe) and the continuing down market efforts of bmw, audi and mb meant that popular brands like ford, vauxhall/opel, renault and peugeot were getting squeezed.

might that be happening here in the states? it's possible, quite possible."
">>to each his own. imho, the styling of the cla is overdone. mb seems to be overdoing the blades and cuts on the nose and tail.

you're correct...i was assuming everybody most love the styling because i think it's fantastic"

"with a $3,000 price increase, bmw is taking the apples to oranges marketing plan.. and letting audi and mb battle in the entry level sedans (cla/audi).
since most family oriented buyers will like the size of the 3 series/audi and those (younger buyers) seeking a smaller ride won't mind the smaller 2 coupe and may prefer it over the audi/cla, this maybe a good plan.

regrettably, the last coupe i had was a 73 ford and will wait for my midlife for a stingray... so for a few years, hopefully i and you will be happy with the s4."

"quick take: 2014 s4 s-tronic (333 hp 325 lb ft).

there must be some reason that audi would understate the power of one (or more for all i know) of their engines. maybe it is a tax thing in germany. whatever the reason, it seems to me that there is no way this car has only 333 hp and 325 lb ft.

i had heard that the 2.0t's power as it stands in the current audi is understated (and i have driven the car and it does seem impossible that it is 220 hp motivating a car that big) and i read a test report of the s8 that wagged its finger at audi for understating that engine, too, so i guess it must be an audi practice to under-rate their engines.

of course, other than for tax reasons (if that really is true), why would they do this? i recall that acura (and others) had to restate the power of the rl's 3.7l v6 (to less than 300 hp), suggesting to me that most car companies would probably like to find a way to overstate the power numbers (hp measured at sea level on a cold day, for instance).

in any case, even with less than 1,000 miles on it, the s4 seems to have great, surprising, reserves of power -- perhaps sports car power. an rs version must be dangerous, if this s version is any indication.

once again, i find myself wondering why the recent spate of car magazine sport sedan comparos doesn't include this car!?"
"mark when it comes to hp, the german's have always done it different. if you take the bmw bmw, the car makes 300hp and 300 lbs of torque, however, ifyou look at the times it run, there is no way that a 300hp car can run that fast, and dyno test have proven over and over again that it makes more power. also the 7 spd dsg helps too. i also believe that engines today make power more efficiently then before. my 320i only makes 180hp and 200lbs of torque but the passing on the highway is effortless..."
"as for why the magazines aren't testing the s4 with the others, it may have lost a comparision test with one of the others in the past, i am not sure how old the current a/s4 is. also the may be justifying it by testing rwd performance sedans, maybe they will do an awd test later ( not saying it is right, but might be their thinking). i think generally the first answer is the reason ( same reason the mercedes-benz isn't in the tests). that toyotad i am sure the a/s4 is right up there with the others, and depending on what you are looking for may be the best."
"drove from cincinnati to columbus and back yesterday -- on the way back, crossed over to 1,000+ miles on the od.

well, for reasons i cannot imagine -- other than the fact that here in ohio we have raised the top speed limit from 65 to 70mph (and everybody does limit+10 and lots do limit+20) -- i got in with a ""pack"" of cars cruising along between 85 and 90, and for the hell of it, i got in the left lane and punched it for just a couple of seconds: an indicated 101mph ""just like that!"" poof.

endnote3: i got used to having the garage door opener work with the car turned off on the acura, can't do it on the audi. this means you have to close the garage door with the engine running -- i know it is only a few seconds, but with all the software controlled things the mmi permits/enables, you'd think there could be a menu item that lets you choose what will operate with the engine off. i know this is a picking of the nits, but there needs to be a software update to take care of some of the little things that shouldn't be on a nearly $57k car.

overall, however, this thing is a blast!

more later.

"i'm not a big car enthusiast. back in 2006, i was reading these forums for audi and bmw but in the end bought a honda because i knew i wasn't going to be driving much -- the 7 year old honda has just over 23k miles.

however, i'm thinking of getting something better and one thing that might drive my choice would be what kind of european delivery progdodge the manufacturer offers. back 7 years ago, i think only bmw was doing ed and there were packages to drive through switzerland and down into italy, lake como to be specific.

the savings, with fob originating in munich, could result in a lease that saved you enough to pay for the trip to germany (maybe not to tour around europe though).

i see now that mercedes-benz and audi are offering ed again.

so do these and the bmw ed progdodges still offer substantial savings on leases?

i still won't drive that much so i don't need a lot of miles per year but i'd at least start off with a good tour in europe."
"volvo has a very good ed progdodge. if you want to see sweden, and want a volvo."
"i got used to having the garage door opener work with the car turned off on the acura, can't do it on the audi. this means you have to close the garage door with the engine running...

same thing in my volkswagen. i attribute that to home protection. if you car is parked in the driveway, one can't just break into your car to open the garage door."
"my honda's don't need the car on. i prefer that.

besides, if you have a garage to open, you should park the care in it!"
"besides, if you have a garage to open, you should park the care in it!

i totally agree but if you own 3 cars and have a two car garage......"
"well, obvious answer, build a bigger garage.

anyway, if someone is going to break into your car they will just break into your house. plus you could just lock the door into the house."
"plus you could just lock the door into the house.

too many tools in the garage to help them break the lock....

""if it ain't one thing, it's another"""
"it is safer from a security aspect to disable the opener unless one has the car key but it does make it a little inconvenient at times. if i had my choice i would probably like it not to work when the key is absent. can't think of a many times where i used the homelink without having the keys on me. in fact, i don't know if mine will work without the key or not...i'll have to check. i've got a fair amount of equipment and tools in the garage to steal, let alone have them available to break into the house in complete privacy from inside the garage."
"mark, my 320 has 1200 miles on it most are by rick, he had to go to tucson for his uncle's funeral, on his way back he was pilled over for speeding. , he direct quote was, ""i can not believe i was doing 80 the felt more like i was doing 60."" he was given a warning. whe i drove the car up to prescott i too was surprised on how one has a hard time ""feeling"" the speed of the car, ricks hyundai is the same way. as i wrote the engine has a effortless about it when cruising on the highway that none of my other bmw's had. e46 built up the speed, as well as the e90 did. i keep hearing rick mention how much he likes driving his bmw, maybe i can persuade him to trade his hyundai in and i can get the s5 i was looking at..."
"not sure if i gave you both the official congratulations & mazel tov on your new rides! best of luck to you both & use them well!

robsubaru - funny you should mention about ""too many tools in the garage to break the lock."" when we bought our house 3 years ago, we had an alarm installed. the guy was going over all of the features and he toyotad something to the effect of: ""and if you ever come home & someone jumps out of the bushes and pulls a knife on you, do this..."""
"""the e46 was and is today the best 3 series bmw built.""

sorry flight, i just can't let that pass. everybody knows that the e46 is the 2nd best bmw.

ok, back to our regularly scheduled discussion..."
"so what is the best 3 series? now i'm not talking about certain model, but overall 3 series, series."
"man....you could make a case for a lot of candidates for ""best"" 3 series.

my first one was an e30, bought used. driven hard for 4 years, without one hiccup. sold it for about $2k less than i bought it for, which i thought was great.

every subsequent one ('06 330i and '11 bmwx coupe) really never was as much fun as the '87 325i. still, they were good in their own right.

but, i experienced the progression and transformation from sports sedan into luxo badged car first hand with each one i had.

the newer ones are indeed faster than the '87 325i, but none of them were as much fun to drive. not really sure their fuel economy is better, either.

iirc, i was getting mid 20s mpg in town on that 325i, and knocking on 30 mpg all highway."
"graphic i know what you are saying, i never owned a e30, driven many of them, but for me the e46 was it. perfect balance between pure sport and lux. you could take my 330i on the track during the day and then out to dinner in scottsdale without missing a beat. the suspension was rougher then i would really like today. the current 320 has the typical tectonic feel with a slightly softer suspension, but if you want more sport, order the sport package which gives you the m sport package..."
"what is ""tectonic feel""? something is shifting under you, like tectonic plates? i'm not making fun of you, i just don't know what you mean."
i am guessing it was an auto correct or a typo and was supposed to be teutonic feel.
"i am guessing it was an auto correct or a typo and was supposed to be teutonic feel.

i loved the teutonic feel of my '98 audi audi 2.8 manual. i didn't like the tectonic feel of the '94 northridge earthquake, however."
"fn...i'm thinking your 320i is the ""new"" sweet spot for a 3 series that offers the ""sport"" of ""luxury sports"" sedans that i'm looking for.

that toyotad, looking at the 320i as competition, i'd choose it over a cla, in a heartbeat. and, i haven't even test driven a cla, yet....just looked at one, and sat in one.

audi0 has been widely panned. so, doubt that would be on my short ltoyota.

audi? i'm probably going to give audi a rest once i move from my s4 in a year, or so.

if i were in the market today? for ~$40k (using available discounts), i'd probably spring for another acura tl sh awd with tech package. i'm really interested to see what acura brings out next spring with the new tl(x).

to get what i want in a 3 series, i'd probably have to go with at least a bmwx (with the preference being a bmwx). equipped the way i want, assuming a $3k-$4k discount, i'd still be in that upper $40k range, into the low $50k range. that's a price range i think hits into the ""diminishing returns"" category, however.

although, i do find the upcoming m235i intriguing."
"i would urge you to get the advance, not tech version of the tl. i got a 13% discount on my 2012, advance, so my guess is they have more to play with in that car -- and you will get the 19"" wheels which both improve the turn in and looks.

moreover, you get the really cool (pun intended) vented seats -- and, most importantly blind spot monitoring.

i know y'all will give me grief, but for the money the tl sh-awd advance is acura's version of an s4.

the thing is, for most, just too ugly, hence no matter what i say to anyone they just can't get past the looks.

again, for the money, the acura as noted above is worth cross shopping with the s4 -- now, is the acura likely to be confused with the s4? nope.

is the s4, lightly optioned, worth $10,000 more than the tl? yep.

would most folks cross shop these two cars? i doubt it.

if you can't or don't want to afford an s4 and the new audi0 leaves you cold, your only ""cheap"" choice is the tl sh-awd advance. all in with the tl, adding parktronic and upgrading the tires to 19"" uhp ""z"" or ""y"" or ""w"" rated rutoyotaer, you're going to be at $47k or maybe $48k (msrp).

btw: i am not excluding the bmw bmw x-drive -- but, like the s4, it seems (or seemed) to be made of unobtanium; and for some reason the 3 series seems a bit small to me.

the is 350 f sport doesn't have the engine the audi s4 has, of course; and, frankly, the acura at 305hp feels no less potent than the is 350.

my s4 is a premium plus s-tronic version in free paint -- ibis white -- with the upgraded leather seats, mmi+, blind spot monitoring, b&o sound system and carbon fiber trim (which looks nice, but for $500? naaaah.) with shipping the thing was $57k -- $10k more than the tl and $7k more than an is 350 awd f-sport.

i drove:

audi0s awd
is 350 awd f-sport
volvo volvo type/r (also awd)
acura tl sh-awd advance
audi audi 2.0t sport
audi audi 2.0t sport
audi s4 s-tronic
audi s4 6-speed manual shift
audi saudi 8-speed tiptronic (prestige)

thinking an s4 (my preference) was ""out of reach"" and not thinking the audi or audi 2.0t versions had sufficient ""guts,"" and reading the critical reviews of the audi0s, i ordered a 2014 is 350 awd f-sport in ultra white with the red leather interior.

my wife, meanwhile, was smitten with the saudi prestige and ordered that. while we were filling out the paperwork on her saudi, i commented how much i would rather have the s4 than the is, but that the price of the s4 made it seem to be constructed out of unobtainium.

days later, audi dealer says -- i can get you a white s4 s-tronic with magma red leather and the blind spot warning (which was a deal breaker or maker option) -- and we think, with no money down, we can meet the lexus' price since you are now eligible for the audi loyalty discount (since your wife has also rejoined the audi family.)

the moral of the story: if you can't or don't want to ""afford"" the s4 (or whatever your passion inducing car is), of all of the remaining choices, you will have to give up less if you get the tl sh-awd advance than any other car on the ellps ltoyota -- and you will surely pay less (comparably equipped).

dilyl"
"mark...thanks for your honda.

not sure where i'm going from here. i heard last week that my s4 will probably need a new trans. granted, it's covered under warranty. but, this is just one in an ongoing series of trips into the service area of the dealership. that, and it seems it could take as long as a month to get it fixed.

ordinarily, i'd get into the whole ""lemon law"" thing, but i still like the car, believe it or not. it's clear i'm not going to keep it long term, however. so, the quandry becomes how much of a hit will i take if i hold onto it, and try to sell/trade it, and that carfax shows all the service it has needed?

i'm going to have to make up my mind relatively quickly here. if i lemon it (i don't think i'll get much pushback), what do i replace it with? this isn't the first time i've lemoned a car (helped my late mother lemon law her cadillac several years ago). i know the drill. it'll take a couple of months.

another audi? probably not.

cadillac? the new cts intrigues me, but i'm not hyundaiing up another $50k for a car. plus, there's my lemon law experience with them....not good.

infiniti....boy, i try and try to like them. i just can't seem to embrace their cars, for a variety of reasons. same goes for mercedes-benz. i always feel like i would be paying too much for an underpowered german sedan with them....particularly compared to the competition.

lexus? i liked the previous is, except it was small for my tastes. gs? maybe.

i do think bmw is on the short ltoyota. but, as you say, just like the s4, the one i'm interested in (335) is tought to find. plus, you're breaking way past that $50k mark if you do find one. the m235 intrigues me. there again, you have a size ""thing"".

i do like acuras. as you say, the tl sh awd advance is right there. plus, from what i'm reading, getting one all loaded up for right around $40k is compelling. i drove my stoyotaer's tl a while ago. i may have to borrow hers again.

first things first...i have to decide what to do with the s4."
"'the m235 intrigues me.'

this m235i looks like it may make
my &#145;short ltoyota&#146; in a couple of years.

a couple of specifics:
performance &#150; the quoted acceleration times from bmw
are almost exactly the same as the bmw i leased.

fuel economy &#150; the epa toyotates are rather
ddodgeatically better than that bmw !
[ 22 honda / 32 hiway &#150; m235i
17 honda / 24 hiway &#150; 2011 bmw ]

the price &#150; at $44k base, including the 8-speed
automatic trans., this compares with $53.5k
for the 2011 bmw, with the 7-speed dct.

although this 2 series is slightly smaller than
the 335, i really do not need anything larger . . .
[ heck, i had a chevrolet as my only vehicle for
over 30,000 miles. ]

and it appears that there may be a 4-door???

anyway &#150; subject to magazine reports &
a few test drives [ of course ] i do like
what i see and read, so far.

not in the market, just yet . . ."
"is this your first transmission issue?

i'm not mazdar with lemon laws...i thought the same 'fix' had to occur 4 or more times, or the vehicle has to be out of commission for 30+ days."
"buenas gente de la mañana, y feliz día de los muertos, aquí en el suroeste se trata de un día muy especial.

graphic your s4 needs a new transmission, wtf... plus it might take audi a month to fix it, i think i would be looking at some compensation for this, since your lease payment wont stop while you can't drive it....

in regards to a new car, it always comes down to wants v needs. why not take the simpler approach to this, get yourself a bmw328xi with the premium package and nav (not the tech package) which will get you into the car under 45k before discounts. if you go through costco auto progdodge the price is roughly 42k.

if you are thinking of a coupe, look outside the box at a hyundai hyundai coupe with the 3.8l v6."
happy halloween to you too flightnurse:)
i have a feeling you are going to end up with tl #2. just an educated guess!
"ivan...if (big if) it takes a month to get and install a new trans (all the associated parts have to be ordered, too) i think i have a good case for lemon law. in addition, the car has been in the dealer's service dept for numerous other issues (some of which couldn't be resolved...like mmi issues) for another 10-12 days (i have to tally them up).

dealership states that they don't know which parts will be needed until the trans is out, which makes the car undriveable. so, yeah...it could take awhile, given the parts come from germany.

i do love the car. i don't like the hassle of taking it to the dealership, seemingly every other week.

it's not a lease...it's a purchase. if it was a lease, i'd just keep it for what would be the next 16-17 months and not worry about it.

ray...i thought you were done with bmw? do you know when the m235 is supposed to hit the showroom?

nyc...i consider the tl a viable alternative. i'm really interested in the new one that's supposed to hit next spring. the question becomes, how long will i hold out on the audi."
"if your stoyotaer doesn't have a tl sh-awd advance, driving her tl could turn you off of getting one.

i was given the fwd tl tech (2013) when mine was in for a service interval. the sh-awd has a ""performance tuned"" suspension. the tl fwd does not.

the sh-awd advance has 19"" wheels and, unfortunately, somewhat lackluster all-season ""v"" rated tires (somewhat stiffer sidewalls), but this version of the tl is only similar to a regular fwd tl in its basic looks.

add the dealer installed parktronic and scrap the factory rutoyotaers on the tl sh-awd advance; replace them with uhp w or even z rated a/s tires (there are several to choose from -- see tire rack.com) and you will have a $47k (msrp) ""acura s4-lite."" next factor in the possibility of a decent discount (10% based on what i see here in river honda) should be a no brainer, and remember i got 13% off of the bottom line of the msrp sticker.

i do caution you to not think that any other version of the tl than the sh-awd advance will be ""close enough for honda."" is there any newness on the 2014's, or are we going to have to wait for the 2015 my to see if the ugly duckling can turn into a beautiful swan?

dilyl"
surprised they didn't recall the whole lot of tls due to styling alone- we all know what happen to pontiac for giving us the aztec - this is a similar situation
"just curious why a volvo volvo isn't on your ltoyota of cars to consider? i have an volvo t5 fwd and it hits all of the sweet spots for me at a reasonable price. only problems i've had are a loose head liner and finicky memory seat. btw, constoyotaently getting over 30 mpg on the highway on regular. i know it doesn't have the status of other cars in this category, but i recommend you take one out. you may be pleasantly surprised."
"mark...my stoyotaer does have an sh awd advance. so, does that come with the 19"" rutoyotaer? i know the brief time i drove hers, it is indeed a nice ride.

never thought about the volvo. another one i need to look at.

first things first, though....gotta decide what to do about the audi."
"yep, all tl sh-awd advance cars came from the factory shod with 19"" wheels and tires -- the tires, are v rated, which is a good thing; however, my 2012 really was transformed when i upgraded to uhp a/s tires.

full disclosure, my advance wheels were bent from the get-go, and acura decided that they would pay only 50% of the cost of the new wheels since they weren't ""discovered"" as bent until 20k miles (i first complained at the first oil change which was just south of 8,000 miles, but acura thought i had warped brake rotors, not bent wheels -- so i was given the opportunity to buy factory oe wheels [19""] at the bargain basement price of $650-ish per.)

but i digress -- yes yes yes, the tl sh-awd advance comes with both sport tuned suspension bits and 19"" high performance rutoyotaer.

i did like my tl -- but i love my s4. hopefully i will be the beneficiary of audis new consumer reports reliability rating of #4 most reliable car and #1 most reliable european car.

btw, the volvo volvo t6 type-r is in the msrp range of the above noted acura tl sh-awd advance. however, where acura will discount the poop out of the tl, volvo will give perhaps 3 or 4% off (if it is at the end of the month). the trouble with volvo is they never seem to have any car in stock that pulls it all together.

but wait -- the volvo european delivery progdodge is one of the best of any manufacturer -- get the dvd that 'splains it. that might make paying closer to sticker a bit more palatable; and if you get the t6 type-r polestar edition, you can drive the thing on the autobahn if you stay a couple of extra days, then turn it back in at one of the drop off points and fly business class back to the states!

if you've ever driven a fine european car on the autobahn, you know what i mean when i say it should be on everyone (who loves cars) bucket ltoyota.

"i recommend you exchange your lemon s4 for a real new s4. after all, what are the chances you'll get two lemons in a row?

especially considering audi is now more reliable brand-wide than infinity!

a serious accomplishment, but i can't blame you for being weary based on your own personal experience.

if acura improves the 5 or 6 key points of problems i noticed with the tl-sh-awd, they will have a winner on their hands with the 2015 version.

1) no plastic trim/rails on the roof!
2) 330+ hp
3) dual clutch transmission please!
4) 200+ pounds lighter, & more balanced weight dtoyotaribution (such as moving front brake calipers to back side of wheel).
5) make the awesome sound system with dvd-a standard.
6) make the good leather (mercuryo leather) standard. offer the brown leather interior color in more than just the advance trimming.
7) offer better colors and more selection!
8) make it better looking and more stylish.

9) sell it for $40k out the door taxes included.

if they had met 6 or 7 of the above 9 items, i'd already be sold."
"ray...my apologies. i thought you had toyotad you were moving away from bmw. i was wrong.

andres...you bring up a very good point. what are the odds to s4s are problematic?

i'll have to get my hands on my stoyotaer's tl and drive it again. i remember thinking it drove really well...much better than the one i had 4 years prior. her leather is nicer than the leather i have in the s4. so, i guess the key is to get the upper models of the tl to get the real ""goodies"". i know she bought her tl sh awd advance for around $40k, give or take, that's a lot of performance and a lot of really nice car for that price.

we'll see how this plays out with my s4."
"especially considering audi is now more reliable brand-wide than infinity!

you are speaking of ""initial quality"" are you not? big difference."
"no, i it's also improved for longer term, hondaing to consumer reports, not just initial. the rank is based on surveys for several years back and represents forward projection of those results."
huh. interesting... kind of.
"i'll be the first to knock initial quality as a relatively useless thing.

after all, my lemon-like dodge neon had reasonably ok initial quality. it was the long term quality that reared its ugly head over and over.

the problem was there was no long term quality, it was planned to be obsolete the day after 3 years or the mile after 36,000.

that being toyotad, there were some early tell tale signs that it was not going to be an acceptable car. my view is if i have a significant amount of problems in the first 3 years, odds are it'll be exponentially more after warranty. then again, my friends nissan blew it's engine and transmission in its first month, and ended up being extremely reliable for about 5-6 years, and then all hell broke loose again.

2nd failed cvt transmission and failed cat converter (both covered by nissan because nissan knows they are failure prone). i'm still waiting for a ""extended neon"" warranty check from chrysler.

not holding my breath though, it's obvious that chrysler's culture views a car that has failed head gaskets, ac compressor, and auto transmission all by 60,000 miles (in addition to about 15 other things that broke) as perfectly normal. as the dealer service manager told me ""parts just break down.""

my experience at honda and audi and (my best friend with nissan) is just the polar opposite, it is a culture where parts breakdowns are unacceptable! if it happens, they seem to do they're absolute best at minimizing them.

for example, honda replacing my transmission out of warranty at 42k miles for free, and doing it in 2.5 days. audi fixed my ac at 53,000 miles out of warranty in a very similar manner (though it took 2 weeks, but i had an audi loaner so i was happy). audi sending me a check for nearly $700 for failed induction control modules since it was warrantied retroactively to 120,000 miles, and my best friends experience with nissan above.

my ac failed at literally year 3 - day 3 (under 36k miles), and dodge never blinked an eye for offering asstoyotaance.

head gaskets at 40 or 45k, dodge dealer made no comment.

auto transmission at 60k (independent shop's comment was ""i can't believe they are still using those cheap ancient 3-speeds."")

i think i'm justified in not only boycotting the big 3 for life, but forbidding my children (at least until age 18 i think i can) to give the big 3 any money. after 18 i'll just have to disown them if they do so. :p"
"out of curiosity, you call the neon yours but you've also toyotad it was your parents. which is it?"
"dropped the audi off yesterday for another attempt for the dealer to fix the mmi and drivetrain grinding/binding issues.

they put me in an audi...only this time with the 4 cyl turbo. i wanted one with the 3.0 s/c. but, the only loaners they had were the audi and an audi with the same motor. i took the audi.

surprisingly, the 4 cyl turbo in the audi does a good job. it's certainly light years smoother than bmw's 4 turbo. understand, this is a heavy car. and, there's a noticeable fall off in acceleration with the turbo 4. but, if you're not really a performance car enthusiast, you get the handling and ride of the audi with a wee bit of ""sprightliness"" thrown in.

not sure the difference in price between it and the audi 3.0, but if anyone's in the market for an audi, and one can be had in the low $40k range (not sure about that last part), it might be worh a look."
"graphic, there is a 8k difference between the turbo 4 and sc v6. you have to move up the mid level premium plus.

i find the turbo engines to do a adequate job of moving the cars around town. my bmw makes 200 lbs of torque at 1250 rpm, about 500 rpms above idle. like the bmw there is a chip for the audi (really volkswagen) turbo 4, which will increase hp to roughly 256hp, and increase torque to about 290lbs total cost about $350. which i believe just increased boost +3 lbs over stock and remaps the air fuel mixture. it's not as much power as your s4, but to get into a audi and have some more power for under 45k not bad.."
"fn....just drove down to lexinpontiacn this a.m. in the audi. it's a big car, obviously. but, the 4 cyl turbo does indeed do well in ""normal"" driving. i was quite surprised the amount of ""zing"" it has passing on the interstate. if it were mine, i would have to ""chip"" it, though.

i'll have to get behind the wheel of a 320i someday. yours sounds very nice."
"graphic, this is how manufactures are playing the displacement game, with the turbo engine, allow the engine to make good amount of power down low to ""fool"" people into thinking it has more then advertise, also the 8 spd transmission does not hurt either."
"it was a joint purchase between my dad and i.

i drove it 95%+ of the miles. he'd rarely drive it.

for all intents and purposes it was mine with his financial contribution."
"the 2.0t engine from volkswagen/audi is indeed a great all-around motor. it does work best tuned to stage 1, 1+, or 2.

or better yet, hold out for the new s3 toyotad to equal the bmw performance (300 hp and 300 lb./ft. of torque) with the fantastic 2.0t motor in a 3,100 lb. car. the 2.0t motor is meant to propel cars that are 3,000 to 3,300 pounds, not 2 tons."
the latest cr doesn't think too highly of the new infiniti g27 follow on. did anybody see that?
"tlong....i didn't see the entire article, but i did see a blurb stating that infiniti badly missed the mark (or something to that affect)?

fn...andre....while i like my vehicles with more....ummm...gusto, i can see the appeal of the new(er) 4 cyl turbo lux vehicles. i can see the appeal of the audi with the 2.0l turbo. not my cup of tea. but, it hits a price point and hits most of the ""tic"" boxes one would expect of this type of car (omitting power).

if the 6 cyl motors in these cars weren't so darn good (audi s/c 3.0, bmw turbo 3.0, acura 3.7, etc), and perform so well, i might be able to pry myself away from them. as it stands, i'm still a big fan of the 6s."

that can be faint praise, once the htoyotaory of the coty over the decades is reviewed. the chevrolet vega (1971) and the renault alliance (1983) are two hyundai examples. the lincoln ls (2000) lasted 6-7 years before it was discontinued altogether. that one left a particularly sour taste in my mouth.

gm does advertise a lot, though."
"'the lincoln ls (2000) lasted 6-7 years before it was discontinued altogether. that one left a particularly sour taste in my mouth. '
mine, too.

such potential there ......"
i agree 100%. wasn't the neon given the coty award too?
"another potential ellps contender
for my $s - come the time...

not exactly a road 'test' imho ...."
"keep in mind that motor trend car of the year doesn't mean it's the best car ever made or even available. the award is given to a car that is all new or substantially changed and is judged on superiority, significance and value.

when introduced, the winners are usually a significant entry for the maker. the vega was chevrolet's first attempt at down sized economy car. the ls was lincoln's bmw fighter. the k cars were chrysler's first fwd cars."
"first, there are good intentions, then there's execution, and last there's follow-through.

the only rental car (& i've rented a bunch of them) that left me beside the road wishing it was 25 years later (so i could have had a cell phone) was the alliance. my parents bought a vega.

execution and follow-through matter at least in the world of automobiles. that toyotad, the collective memory of the public is short, very short."
ray....i've been reading a lot about the s3 recently. i wonder if its performance will encroach upon the s4's turf?
"probably, but you'll have to live with a smaller car.

i chose the s4 for 2 reasons over the s3.

1) i can use the extra space and size.

2) the s3 would probably keep me waiting another year (or close to it).

3) from what i understand it has the same old 6-speed dsg in the s3, and i really think it needs that 7th gear as in the s4."
"andres....interesting car (s3) nonetheless. i agree, the s4 will probably be a larger vehicle with more amenities available.

the audi dealer called me this a.m. service manager toyotad they started with the mmi issues. apparently, audi corporate toyotad i was using ""non-compliant cds"" and my ipod wasn't running an authorized version of ios. huh?

i bought the cds from best buy. all of them are ""non-compliant""? ipod came right from apple and ios updates came straight from apple's itunes web site. service manager says he understands my frustration. but, he did download some sort of firmware. he toyotad i should test it when i ge the car back. i told him my ipod and cds are still in the car. all he has to do is to plug in the ipod or play a cd to see if they still cut out all the time.

he sounded frustrated, but toyotad he would. when i inquired about the next step if it doesn't work, he toyotad they'd have to remove the entire dash and colsole to get the mmi out...to replace the mmi. his feeling is if one didn't work, a new one, with the same software, may not work, either. i asked him what happens then? he toyotad...""i don't know"". geesh!

they haven't even touched the grinding/binding audi system yet.

this is not going well."
"sorry about your issues. such a great car, such a waste. your mmi issues just made me realize, two 328 loaners i had in past year had both refuse to play the ipod nano i have - it's the slightly older generation. my own 328 has no problem playing it, but those two brand spanking new ones, did not recognize it. same cable, same connection, same brand. much smaller issue, of course, not even my car, but it just tells me when it comes to electronics, it's always a crap shoot. they charge you full price, but when it doesn't work they tell you what can ya' da - it's electronics, it's new, it's cutting edge (by that they mean, it cuts or it works on the edge of failure).

this lack of accountability in software industry is trully staggering. they charge you arm and leg, license agreements that say they are not responsible for anything, even if it causes nuclear explosion and act like doing you some enormous favor when you want the darn thing to work as described. after two half-a** attempts, they tell you to buy newer and improved version that has no real guarantee to work, either. of course for full price.... ok, you get 10% ""upgrade discount"". no other industry has it better. since software is now everywhere, the culture of non-accountability spread like a disease."
"my own 328 has no problem playing it, but those two brand spanking new ones, did not recognize it.

many audio systems do have issues with older ipod and iphones. basically, they aren't expected to last years and years and as such the audio companies the manufacturers use do not build in compatibility for those older models."
"andres, there is only so much one can do to these engines before things start to break.

i know that the aftermarket has had a chiip for the 1.8t and 2.0t for years, with the added 56hp and 50lbs of torque it really transforms these cars.

the audi/s3 look like fun cars, but man are they small (smaller then the current audi) and for most just too small. give me a audi with a chipped 2.0 and a dsg.."
that s**ks. why something costing $150 and more should not last at least 5 years. what kind of mindset is that? my nano is about 4 years old. that's way too short for new cars not to recognize it.
"dino, you got me thinking, i have two two ipod nano's first generation and third, my 320 plays what is on my iphone with no problems, plugged in my thrid gen nano with the current ios and it played, i'm charging my first gen nano and will give see if it needs an update and will give it a try."
"that s**ks. why something costing $150 and more should not last at least 5 years. what kind of mindset is that? my nano is about 4 years old. that's way too short for new cars not to recognize it.

the life cycle of consumer electronics is about 30 months....

apple isn't in the business of selling you one piece of hardware and having it last forever.

as noted, try updating the os and see if it works."
"i don't need to update anything, it works on my car, it just doesn't on the loaners.

the built-in obsolescence, especially using such short cycles like 30 months is totally unacceptable to me. that's why i don't buy that stuff as much and as often as many others. i'm not ""old"", or ""afraid"", i simply see those as vehicles to get to my wallet by providing some marginal improvements in my life. i am what you would call ""late adopter"" (as opposed to early adopters), i get stuff only when i see a real and lasting improvement in life or business, or lack of that posession would put me in some significant disadvantage. not being able to get latest tweets from people i don't care about is not disadvantage. i'm also not presumptuous to assume that people would be interested what i had for breakfast. the resources (from energy, to physical facilities) required to maintain all that vane electronic waste could probably eliminate world hunger."
"i don't need to update anything, it works on my car, it just doesn't on the loaners.

well i presumed since you complained it didn't work on the loaners it was important to you."
"i understand, you're right. yeah, it may be worth a shot next time, i'm scheduled for a service to go and try an update."

"i don't want to start an argument, although i am not against arguing, if that makes any sense. but i was struck by the statements that things are becoming obsolete (perhaps the implication was ""on purpose"") every 30 months or so.

let me provide some perspective that made me read the ""30 months"" statement and cock my head and have a cartoon balloon with a question mark in it appear overhead.

i have a 2014 audi s4 premium plus with mmi+ and the b&o sound system. i also have the silk nappa leather seat upgrade.

previously i had a 2009 audi audi prestige and sport package equipped 2.0t audi (it also had the power rear sunshade and ads and the b&o sound system.)

before that i had a 2005 audi audi 3.2 with sport wheels and nav and sport seats (with the $1,000 premium leather option), the bose sound system and the built in phone cradle and whatever else made a 2005 audi cost nearly $54,000 new.

now, i kept my 2005 audi about 42 months (6 months beyond the end of the lease due to the delayed delivery in 2008 of the 2009 audi's). i kept the 2009 full term and put some 56k miles on it (and 66k miles as i recall on the '05 audi.)

one month ago i get into my new 2014 s4 configured as noted above.

if you would have put me into my new 2005 audi and i had become mazdar with the controls and the layout of everything and the functioning and format of the electronics and then you had me close my eyes for ""a second"" and re-opened them in october 2008 whilst i was seated behind the wheel of my 2009 audi, then repeated the process and i opened my eyes behind the wheel of my 2014 s4, i would have almost thought all that had changed was the color of the seats and dashboards.

my audi had a black dash with the baseball glove colored leather seats -- the wood trim was walnut dark brown; my audi had an ecru dash and seats -- the wood trim was oak blonde; next up, the s4 has a black dash with the magma red leather seats and carbon fiber trim.

the electronics (the automotive ""avionics"") were virtually unchanged from calendar year 2004 through 2013 (10 years, 120 months). yes, there are some incremental (and mostly pretty small) ""improvements"" in the avionics. i can now recite an entire 10-digit phone number and the voice recognition system doesn't respond ""pardon?"" the moving map is toyotad to be 3d, but that's not literally true, although there is a greater perception of ""depth"" as one looks at the map (sitting or moving).

the b&o system in the 2014 my s4 may be a little bit better than the excellent version of the system circa 2008 in the my 2009 audi (and the b&o is better than the bose that was in the '05 audi.)

overall, though, i would say there has been no ""built-in obsolescence"" since this car's ""systems"" have been around for 10 years without anything of any real form and/or function changing.

now, however, therefore, notwithstanding -- i like the b8's electronics/avionics -- just as i did when i first met them in the '05 audi. i continued to enjoy them in the 2009 audi and although i do -- from time to time -- touch the screen on the s4 thinking it has [or that it must have] the same capabilities that most of today's smart-phones and tablet pc's have.

some are already saying (and have been saying so for some time now) that audi's interior (from the driver's perspective) is long in the tooth. and, maybe, just maybe keeping the look and feel and user interface pretty much the same for 10 years is too long, i think the 2014 audi interior and electronics package has taken a step back, looking like the second gen cadillac cts, which i didn't care for.

i keep my nav screen on almost all of the time. i would hate to have one of those aftermarket looking things (for instance, the pop-up nav that came on gen 2 cts and the current iteration of audi's) that somehow passes for forward movement. who's dumb idea was it to spoil the flowing lines of the newest audi interior with that silly screen that looks, to my eye, as if it were an afterthought.

so. . .built-in obsolescence? 10 years seems about right to me."
"what you are looking at is the user interface. what i was talking about was the technology that delivers that user interface. that life is about 30 months.

maintaining a known interface with just a few tweaks entices current customers to stay with the brand. for many folks, having to learn a new interface when changing car brands would be a major inconvenience. notice that apple hasn't changed the ""i"" interface very much. someone who used an iphone back in 2007 could wake up today and still be able to use an iphone. in fact, they could probably use any touch device as apple set a standard copied by everyone else.

i could say the same thing about honda. i bought my first one in 1991, a second in 1998 and a third in 2000. i can climb into just about any honda and the interface (switches, controls) would be exactly the same. i know it's simpler than the electronic interface you mention, but it's the same idea."
"if you are ""shielded"" from the underlying technology by an evolving not radically changing interface, why would you care if the underlying tech was changing every couple of years or so?

i would think, like the apple iphone, that we all appreciate that the 4 and the 5s have similar user interfaces but that the tech of the 5 is way faster, etc.

i would hope the underlying tech of my 2014 is much changed over my 2005 audi, in fact i would be ok if it changed annually even if i only change my car every 3+ years or so.

i hate to be dense, but isn't it a good thing that tech keeps marching forward?

i do agree making the thing have deliberate built-in obsolescence just for the sake of making it obsolete would make no sense; but, i am going to assume that while my audi's user interface has little changed that the underlying stuff has changed (and for the betterment of all human-kind).

why is it problematic [for you] that some tech is toyotad to have become obsolete in 30 months or whatever time fdodgee. now the issue i would have is if the tech became unreliable or lacked durability. as far as i know the 2005 audi mmi system works fine, lasts a long time -- but i would assume, i would hope even that the stuff underneath has been improved and improved and improved since it was first brought to market."
"that a sporty car had a taut suspension that was cleverly designed to allow the vehicle to go around corners like it was ""on rails."" it had a manual transmission that was fun to use. it might have had some kind of big-boy engine that provided ~ 6 second 0-60 runs, but that wasn't necessary by any means. it had some kind of audio system that provided entertainment on straight roads (and otherwise, but it didn't matter so much then).

now it's all about electronics.

knock yourselves out."
"if you are ""shielded"" from the underlying technology by an evolving not radically changing interface, why would you care if the underlying tech was changing every couple of years or so? ...... why is it problematic [for you] that some tech is toyotad to have become obsolete in 30 months or whatever time fdodgee.

i wasn't the one that had an issue with the obsolescence of an electronic item. i was the one that stated that hardware - especially consumer electronics - have a short expected life span. the op had an issue with an older ipod working fine in his older bmw but not in the loaners.

imho, products become obsolete by the sheer pace of advances we have today. as technology improves, older items become obsolete simply because the majority abandon them and support resources need to be devoted to current technology. we can't slow down advances simply to support the last adopters."
"i have no problem woth changing tech as long as the old one still works at least for a while. three years is too short, something like six may be acceptable, especially at prices charged by both apple and bmw. i do not accept premise that perfectly functioning $200 product should be tossed out so quickly for sake of new tech that does the same thing, like playing same music files at same quality. btw, my nano has up to date os, which means it is the new 328 interface not accepting it."
"i'm not so sure it's obsolescence, per se. but, i do think that the electronics aren't fully developed in cars to accept what has been a dizzying expansion of chips, pcbs, computers and software used to operate cars.

amazing to me that the (using another acronym) ecu to precisely measure the exact amount of fuel required in each cylinder to maximize power and economy is amazing in and of itself. overall, the car companies have that one nailed.

another case in point, it's pretty amazing that most cars with the capability to tell the driver when his oil needs to be changed, based on sensors monitoring operating temp, mode of driving, etc, is equally amazing.

where they fall down, is they don't put as much effort into understanding how the stereo is supposed to work with an ipod (probably the single most ubtoyotauitous media device currently on the planet). or, in audi's case, how they can't even get cds to play correctly. this, a technology that's been around for at least 30 years (and will probably be dead before the end of the decade).

it's not just audi i'm picking on. i've heard wide spread reports of this from people who own gm cars, the issues with ford's sync, etc. even my bmw e92 had stereo and nav issues (minor in comparison to the audi mmi), and that platform had been around for awhile.

my personal opinion, if you're going to be nonchalant about the electronics and features of your cars, don't put them in the car to begin with. they again, they appear to be ""behind the time"" if they don't have those features. so, they prefer to half-assed measures just so they can ltoyota a ""feature"" in marketing brochures.

one thing i have to do, is to tip my hat to the japanese lux manufacturers. there's not one acura, lexus or infiniti that i've been in that the tech hasn't worked the way it's supposed to. they put the effort and time in to make it work.

speaking of which, just got off the phone with the audi dealer. they still don't know what's wrong, but do have the mmi apart (assuming the dash is apart, as is the console since the mmi controller resides there). i inquired about the trans/audi binding issue. they haven't even begun that trouble shooting process. they did say the audi ""rep"" is due to come in to look at my car. but, that's not until mid next week.

so, i'm still tooling around in their audi 2.0. while this is a nice car. it's not an sx audi vehicle. we had a dusting of snow this a.m. it did just fine. but, it's a big car. as good as the 4 cyl turbo is, (and it's really good), it's still hauling around a heavy car, and you feel it."
"that is the question? after a great run in the g- yes it's been 7 model years and 38k miles - my g finally gave me some trouble- the drivetrain belt (alternator belt?) shredded on the highway a few miles from work- was able to limp the car into the lot and had it towed to dealer for the 200bux repair. made me think time for an upgrade? but then again it was only 200 bux to fix, but could this be the beginning of other more major issues to happen...i've never owned a car out of warrantee before- made me worry. checked out the new q in the dealership, nice looking rig but the consumer reports article still rates the g higher. plus they are not cheap and few deals around this far. 2 other options a cpo 335x (pre new body) or a cpo audi s4. both have great warranties - both great performers - but hearing the recent take on s4 issues has me worried, along with costs of course. could wait a year and do the s3, sure is a looker - prob tops out around 50k - has enuf hp to an low end grunt- but can i wait- love hearing the experience thou from the masses."
"although i wasn't as active a participant here (and elsewhere) whilst i had my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance, i was a frequent reader of the postings and musings of those who participated those ""lonely"" 28 months.

i would not hesitate to recommend an acura such as the one i had -- i would, however, try to put things into perspective for someone shopping for one of these ellps vehicles. the acura was ______________ (fill in the blank with some mostly positive comments) and it remains an attractive car considering its price and (at the time) considering the fact that it is/was heavily discounted (13% off sticker in my case). i will still remember it as acura's s4 (despite the fact that few would ever cross-shop the two cars).

if you're looking to enter into ellps land ""on the cheap"" i would say you can't do better than go for one of the current tl sh-awd versions (the fwd version, however, does not qualify). however, in response to comments about acura's ""tech/electronics"" working (apparently compared to audi's mmi+), well i know it is a ""nit"" but the voice response software (at least in mine) would not function hondaing to the owner's manual. i called acura and took my car to the dealer (who had an acura tech super user as a sales rep) -- both sources say the voice activation did have ""bugs"" in it. moreover, when i asked acura if there would be a fix, they toyotad ""no updates are in the pipeline at this time.""

i have (remembering that i have had three different mmi cars since 2005) had my ""mmi os"" -- what i would call ""windows for the car"" updated once on the 2005 and once on the 2009 -- and nothing so far on the 2014. i never had and still have never had any issues with my mmi+ equipped audis. and, everything works.

on my acura, for example, the car can have the voice activation system set to a really annoying configuration where the voice system essentially mimics everything you say after you say it and before it does it. it can be turned off (same thing on my wife's 2011 infiniti fx) -- when the voice prompt system is turned to ""minimaltoyota"" mode, it is pretty easy to live with since it doesn't delay and doesn't parrot back your commands as if you might not really have meant what you asked of it. but, when in minimaltoyota mode, functions (voice commands) that the manual says work . . .won't.

the acura has no clock that is easy to locate at a glance. however, it has a feature that allows you to simply ask, out loud, ""what time is it?"" and, the voice system recites the correct time. i thought it was a fairly neat little command that i often used when i was alone in the car and, well, er -- speeding. i could, without hunting on my wrtoyota or the dash panel simply say ""what time is it?"" the system would comply and tell me the time of day.

however, this feature was ""disabled"" (and acura toyotad it should work regardless of the setting of the voice system to ""annoying"" mode) unless the voice response system was set to ""long mode"" (annoying mode).

another annoying feature was the phone number input (by voice) which would inevitably put a zero in front of the number i was dialing -- or sometimes it would put a ""#"" sign and announce the character as ""pound.""

overall, the acura system worked fairly well -- but there were more quirks in it than in any of my 3 audis or my wife's tech package fx. over the course of 28 months, i rarely used the voice command capability because it was either a little frustrating or annoying to use. mmi, by comparison is almost like ""natural language"" (almost).

the infiniti system, too, rarely gets it wrong and doesn't require any time at all to learn to use.

the point, belabored for sure, is that i (a voice of one) found the acura system ""more trouble than it was worth"" and also a system that wasn't nearly as intuitive as my wife's bmw (2008) or her 2011 infiniti or any audi i've had with the voice feature.

to each his/her own to be sure -- but i'm all for updating the tech systems on these cars asap and with as much frequency as it takes to get the bugs out. :surprise:

dilyl"
"i'm so far beyond biased, it makes everything i say possibly specious -- but i remain, after all, ""often wrong, but never uncertain"" -- but here goes:

audi -- if you hold much stock in cr has moved up the ""reliability"" ratings with each passing year, arriving recently as the #4 ranked vehicle with respect to reliability. i would say that cr is good at the collecting of a good sized sample which makes them a very good resource for objective data (such as reliability and one would think durability, too.)

generally speaking, ""everyone wants to be audi"" -- or so says at least one or two ""car & driver"" type magazines when they wax poetic about auto brands in recent months.

remarkably too, audi's cars keep coming in close to the top or at the top of the heap in comparison tests. most recently the audi 3.0t schooled its most worthy competition and even beat the new cts (and the cts's target was the bmw 5, which, in this case it did beat -- but so did the mercedes-benz in the test.)

since everything does go in cycles, i would say, even with my considerable bias, ""this can't last."" now is the time to make a move and get the audi before it begins what -- eventually -- will be ""slippage."" moreover, if you want something that has been modified and modified and slightly refreshed (last year) meaning it is perhaps the ""best one ever,"" i would think you would be hard pressed to build a better mousetrap than a 2014 audi or s4. now, i may eat my words, but my '14 s4 is an absolute joy to drive. it is damn near a ""masterpiece.""

how i hope that the s4 may be tested (as was the bmw 3) against everyone's favorite newcomer -- the lexus is 350 f-sport (my first choice in this class when i thought the s4 would be out of reach financially.)

in any case, the new audi0 seems to have missed the mark if you believe at least 3 auto enthusiast magazines and cr, so your choices are somewhat limited unless you want to re up for a new (last my) infinitix/sport.

now may be the time ""to audi.""

but, like i toyotad, i'm biased -- often wrong, just not uncertain.

dilyl"
"sorry to here about your recent trouble with the g. glad to hear you were able to make it off the highway to safety & get the car towed to the dealer ok. all things considered, $200 isn't that bad of a repair bill at all.

i think you should take a look at a (pre new body) 335xi. coming from the g, you'll love the power. let us know how it goes!"
"test drive a 2014 audi s4 s-tronic. then, let us all know your reaction."
"as far as technology advancement is concerned, i still don't understand why my $2100 nav option on my 2013 bmw 328 doesn't speak out the name of the streets (text-to-speech) while my 5 years old $200 garmin has been doing it for 5 years.

worse, it looks like bmw realized the driver's need to know exactly when to turn so engineers have thought of placing a bar on the monitor that gets shortened as you approach the turn 800ft-600ft-200ft. i tried and bitterly found out that it's pretty dangerous to glue my eyes to the monitor to follow the bar but if not, i'd miss the turn once in a while. is that some kind of german thought process in display here?"

"thanks, fn. having driven an audi, albeit one with the 4 cyl turbo, for 3 weeks, i can't disagree with any of the c&d assessments. in fairness, i haven't driven the new cts, nor the new e350. i drove a bmw during the bmw drive event. and, i agree that it feels like a ponderous brick on the road (except, i too like the 3.0 turbo motor, but more in a 3 series than the bigger, heavier 5).

i wish my issues with the s4 weren't so confounding. and, that audi's efforts to fix it weren't so feeble. i might consider another audi. as it stands, i'm going to battle with them."
"...i saw at least 3 of them yesterday. in fact, i believe i saw more of them than 3's but i may be immune to noticing the latter since there are so many of them."
"finally, finally, the saudi which we technically ordered before the s4 is in and ready to drive home.

we went ahead and took one ""on the boat"" so we ended up with an saudi prestige with magma red leather and panther black paint ($1,075 option: ouch!).

these two s cars are the quickest vehicles i have ever driven -- save for a chevrolet i rented for a day for a friend's birthday. now that i have 2,000 miles on the s4 it seems to be coming into that ""first wind"" that every audi seems to get fully at about 5,000 miles and again around 10,000 miles.

my wife asked me to floor the s4 on an entrance dodgep here on the i-275 loop that surrounds cincinnati -- before i knew it, and before i even ran out of dodgep, i was at 90mph. i had to slow down to merge for pity's sake.

somehow the tuning of the saudi's 8-speed tiptronic seems to resemble the s-tronic in the s4 pretty closely. the saudi shifts more often (duh!) and at full throttle makes those same fart sounds at shift points just like the s4.

combining military grade power with luxury is no mean feat -- but audi has done it again with the saudi. we even test drove a cayenne (which costs more) and it didn't have the power and urge of the saudi. it seems to get this much power in a cayenne you have to resign yourself to a 6 figure purchase. we got my wife's saudi at 6% off sticker plus $1,000 loyalty bonus.

the s cars will look pretty cool sitting in the garage, too: hers is black and mine is white.

we went ahead and got the 20"" audi oe inch wheels (it came with 21""'s which you can't get all season uhp tires in the correct size) and we had the dealer take off the stock summer only tires and replaced them with new continental extreme performance dws uhp a/s's.

driving it home for good, tonight at 6pm. can't wait.

good bye 2011 infiniti infiniti (which btw has been a very good car, but one that my wife says, ""ain't got no soul."") :surprise:

dilyl"
"mark, all i can say is: niiiiiice.....!!

hope you guys enjoy many safe miles."
"so i guess audi hasn't fixed your issues with your car.

in regards to the cts, i was in ft lauderdale and san diego this week and at national car rental i spoke to the manager of both locations and was told they are expecting the new 2014 cts by jan.. so once i get one i'll post what i think. i had a 2014 ats performance in san diego. even though the ats ""handles"" better then the 3 series, i liked the overall ""package"" that the 3 series offers. the ats is too small for my liking, this was the issue i had with my bmw. i believe the f30 is the right size, i can carry 4 adults without them being cdodgeped in the rear seats."
"working on 300 miles thus far. taking it easy so far, but the car is simply in one word to summarize ""impeccable."""
"andres3 -- wait until you get over 1,000 miles on the od; at that mileage the power improves and the fuel consumption drops. i did notice a slight decrease in the oil level (on the mmi screen), but the indicator still says ""ok.""

if this is your first audi, you will be getting 2 new ones in the future. your ""second"" new audi will come to your garage (at no extra charge) at 5,000 miles (or so) and then you will find yet another new audi at 10,000 miles. now, i say this never having had an audi supercharged engine, but every other audi i've ever had (4, 5, 6 or 8 cylinder, naturally aspirated or forced induction) repeated the ""rebirth"" at the noted mileage. never had the same experience with the various acura, infiniti or bmw's we have had over the years.

we almost always do this: ""i wish"" i had configured the sport differential on my order; ""i wish"" 19"" wheels with a/s uhp tires were offered as an option; ""i wish"" the tracking headlights were offered on the p+ s4 (like are on my wife's new prestige saudi); and i wish the a/s tires were not simply grand touring models, but uhp's like we put on the saudi (continental dsw's). but, even without my wish ltoyota, this is (these two cars -- my s4 and her saudi are) the best audis ever, and my (and my wife's) most favorite cars -- ever.

every time i push the start button, put the car in toyotamic mode (which actually the car ""remembers"" from the first time) and take off, i am impressed by the seemingly intuitive transmission and the sense of an almost unlimited well of horsepower and torque. now that i have 2,000 miles on mine, i am unafraid to floor the accelerator, and find it to be an absolute rush every time i do.

and, don't you just love the little fart sound the thing makes when it shifts?

lets us know your driving impressions as you: drive it like you live."
"so i haven't been traveling so much for work, out of state (that is), but have been working in tucson. on my trips down and back, i have been averaging 36 mpg, this is doing anywhere between 55-80. the traffic between these cities have gotten really back over the years. before you could set the cruise at 80 and just go.

so for thanksgiving, i went over to san diego to see my dad, i-10 west, through palm spring, riverside, and down the i-15 to san diego. weather was clear, temps in the mid to high 60s for most of the trip, no a/c needed. average speed was 75, i averaged 38.5 mpg (car trip computer), however, when i filled up the car took 12 gallons at 460 miles (38.3 mpg), on the way home, temps in the upper 70's to low 80's a/c average speed 80, 37.5 mpg (cars trip computer), 465 miles used 12.5 gallons which is 37.2 mpg. so the car's trip computer is fairly accurate in the mpg.

so a few thoughts on this car, i have 3800 miles on it (much higher then i thought i would have) but this is the nature of my work.

1) the start/stop feature, it is unnerving when you first get in the car and it stops. you get the wtf just happened. now having the car for 2 months, it is second nature, doesn't bother me at all.

2) power, the car is rated at ""only"" 180 hp, but in my daily driving and highway cruising, the power band and torque are set that one would be hard pressed to tell, my last rental was a 2014 hyundai, and while the standard engine make about 200hp, the 320i ""felt faster"" then the hyundai's. btw, i just ordered the stage 1 tuning kit for the 320, 30hp gain and 40 lbs of torque gain for $375. stage 2 is in beta test but from the prelim testing, on a 320i stage two add's another 20 hp and 30 lbs of torque for another $175. mpg is not to be affected at all with these upgrades under normal driving (well see about that.)

3) handling and ride of the new f30 i read people's comments about the steering feel of the new f30, granted it does have the weighted feel of the e90 or the current 1 series and x1, but in daily driving one is really hard pressed to know the lack of feedback. i'm sure on the track it is a completely different story. the ride of the non-sport f30 is typical german, well controlled without it being too harsh, now, my e90 with the m sport pack and run flat tires wasn't so bad if the road was smooth, but as we all know, not many cities have ultra smooth road, and that combo get's tiresome after a while. do i wish for better supportive seats, yes, but over all, no real complaints. i was not tired at all on my trip to san diego, my first stop is always just north palm spring which takes about 4 hours to get, no sore butt or fatigue at all.

has bmw last some of the edge that the 3 series had, yes, bmw was always more of a ""sport"" sedan, then a ""luxury"" sedan but the people with the money (buyers) want more luxury which is fine, but i think bmw can make both sides happy without really compromising too much, i just hope they find the happy medium.

some grips about what has become of the 3 series, when building a new 3 series, the only two interior color one can get with the sport pack is black or red. if you want other colors you have to get the m sport pack, luxury model or standard. i wish the enhanced bluetooth and alarm was standard.

with that being toyotad, i like the 320i, it does want i want it to do, the price was reasonable and the resale value of the 320i seems to high on it, but time will tell."
"nice write up fn. sounds like a very good car.

i know when i had mine, i thought the power was way under rated (at least from what bmw claimed). sounds like they did the same with the 320i. i had the performance pack installed on mine for an extra 20 hp. well worth the money.

maybe the 320i is the spiritual successor to the 2002ti."
"graphic, i think one of the factors i think people are missing is the fun factor of a car. i don't remember which magazine i was reading but one of them did a write up on the original 320 and the current 320.

it has been well known that the hp that the bmw's rates their cars are underrated."

any idea on pricing? i was thinking if things keep going with the s4 the way they've been goind, i might be interested in the 235i m. but, this looks quite interesting, too."

i also agree with you that the 2 series m looks very nice, if the price could be kept under 50k i think bmw would have a major hit on their hands.

major reason for the twin turbo 6

better mpg, bmw wont meet the cafe that is set by our government, also driveability, the out going v8, thought nice, was really a dog in normal driving, from the reports of this new engine, one can drive it like a normal bmw in town and it wont have problems, the greater torque of the 6 will also allow bmw to get better mpg..."
"thanks fn....do you know when the 235 m is supposed to hit the streets?

i think the $55k is the top end of my price threshhold. that means, the bmw is probably not going to be on my ltoyota. matter of fact, i'd love to come in well under $50k. i'd stretch it if i was really bowled over by a car, but i'm fairly mazdar with what's out there in those price ranges and feel confident i'm not going to get bowled over."

"i had sent this ""privately"" and now i figure what the heck -- perhaps there is some merit in these remarks for others, too.
at $55,000 (net), you can easily get into a well-optioned 2014 audi s4 premium plus. clearly i don't know what would impress you -- and if this audi doesn't do it for you, you can load up a is 350 f-sport and at full msrp be @ less than $51,000. of course of the two noted above, the s4 is the real performer with its sweet supercharged v6.
the torque steer is something to overcome in the volvo volvo t6 (type r) but it is tough to get this car over $50,000. it may not do it for you due to the obvious fwd bias, but it is worth a test-drive if you're in the market at this dollar amount.
so, while $55k won't get us into the supercar realm, we do have a number of choices that will stay under this price cap. it's a great time to be in the market (the $50k+ market) if you ax' me.

"mark...i replied privately, at least that's what i thought with the new forums now in place.
don't get me wrong, i think the s4 is one of the best 4 door sports sedans on the market, regardless of price. but, mine has been very trouble prone (it's sitting at the dealership yet again right now).
the chicago regional rep, took over communications from the dealer i purchased it from. and, he's supposed to be in communication with the local dealer. i think the local dealer is just as frustrated with the local audi regional rep as i am.
we're well over the ""30 day"" rule of the car being out of commission. so, i think they're all huddling, trying to decide the next step to take.
i'll wait to see what they do. so far, everyone except the local audi regional rep have been great to work with.
i ""think"" i know which diretion this will end up, but you never know. that toyotad, if they do end up ""lemon"" lawing my car, i'll obviously be in a scdodgeble to get something else. what that is, i really don't know.
ray...i do like that 235i m. but, i doubt that will be in my time bracket if they do a buy back.
i may make a little trip around this weekend looking at different cars, just for kicks."
"i have, in this forum, shared my experiences with my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance. i did suggest that i understood and largely agreed with the july '10 automobile comparison of a tl (sh-awd) with an audi s4 (with the sport differential – audi's torque vectoring rear diff).
refresher (from automobile, july 2010): “you probably never thought of the acura tl sh-awd and the audi s4 on the same day, much less in the same sentence. . . .significantly, they both use torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive systems to ensure that they don't sacrifice one iota of the corner-carving thrills you've grown to love.”
“in a [non-permissible content removed]-for-tat comparison between two cars that share the same driveline philosophy, it quickly becomes obvious that the acura and the audi are significantly different only in the details.”
now, with 3,000+ miles on my '14 s4 and after 40,000+ miles with my tl, i can offer my 2¢ more.
first, let’s get the “as owned “ msrp’s out there. with rear parking sensors, upgraded tires (uhp a/s's) and suzuki guards, the tl sh-awd advance comes in a bit south of $48,000. approximately comparably equipped (but sans the sport differential) the s4 premium+ easily sweeps past $57,000, coming in at $57,650 (without premium paint, which could have added additional $, had i selected one of the many optional colors offered.) my '12 acura came with the color called bellanova white pearl while the audi i configured was in a glossy hue they call ibis white. a metallic white option on the audi would have added another $550 to the msrp.
if you’re keeping score, the audi starts out about $10,000 more than the acura similarly contented. but simply saying they have similar content somehow makes the audi seem expensive, a perspective i have come to believe is untrue. as the automobile review declares, “[they] are significantly different only in the details.” never a truer statement was toyotad about these two cars. and, please, don’t for a minute think that somehow this is a knock on the acura.
indeed, considering its performance & content, the tl sh-awd advance_ is_ rather a bargain (and i mean what i say only about the sh-awd advance version – what i say should not suggest i would make these remarks about other tl configurations). perhaps were i given the opportunity to test a tl with both sh-awd and the manual transmission, i would change my opinion.
the audi is neither over-priced nor is it a bargain – but, considering its price, it is unlikely you will find the s4’s luxury content and performance envelope replicated without spending thousands more. the current heart-throb car, the lexus is 350 f-sport, offers a very high contented, audaciously styled machine to be sure, but its performance isn’t up to the s4’s; in fairness, however, an f-sport even over loaded with optional stuff, will have trouble breaking the $50,000 msrp barrier.
there is, currently, no bmw bmw m car (if you don’t include the bmw” m” convertible, starting at $69,050, which i am not counting) – and if there were, it too would easily chevrolet through a $65,000 price; besides, the comparison to the s4 would be incorrect, the bmw m would be more accurately compared to an rs – not s – audi car.
back to the tl vs the s4. both cars do what they do well – at their respective price points. the acura – subjectively – may well represent/possess over 90% of the audi’s performance. and, for the money asked, the acura remains perhaps one of the biggest bargains today in the ellps category (assuming you can get over the exterior – and for some, the interior – styling).
here is what you get for your extra $10,000+ in the audi s4: a palpable sense that anything and everything you want the car to do is effortless. from the s-tronic’s apparent ability to read the driver’s mind, to an incredibly deep bucketful of power that is always ready a ¼ of a second before you ask for it, to an ability to corner that approaches violating the laws of physics, the s4 almost becomes an extension of the driver’s mind, rather like green lantern’s power-ring, i suspect.
in contrast, the tl sh-awd is not quite as much the natural athlete as the s4 – although it has nothing to be ashamed of, it’s just that to get 90% of the s4’s performance out of the tl, you have to work at it. here’s one reason why: the tl’s well of torque isn’t as deep as the audi’s and the tl’s torque doesn’t reach full-boil until significantly higher rpm’s (the tl's v6 is naturally aspirated vs the s4's supercharged v6). the consequences of less torque attained at higher rpm’s twtoyotaing through 6 (automatic) gears are not subtle – the acura must be kept “cranked up” to get the most out of it. while doing this can be pretty rewarding, it is hardly effortless.
another huge disadvantage the tl has is its 6 speed traditional (it uses a torque converter) automatic transmission. the audi’s 7-speed direct shift (twin-clutch) transmission by comparison feels as if the smoothest stick shift driver ever is selecting the perfect time for upshifts and downshifts. coming to a stop, the audi’s transmission downshifts both at the appropriate time but also with incredible precision and smoothness that i doubt any one of us contributors here could even come close to.
in the final analysis, the 2012 tl sh-awd advance is a lot of car for the money – and i would still call it acura’s s4. for $47,000+ there isn’t much – if anything – that comes close to the content and performance offered (if you can get past its untoyotaue styling and busy button-laden cockpit.) i had mine 40,000+ miles over less than a 30 month time period and other than what i assumed were weak brakes (the rotors were turned twice before 25k miles before the dealer determined the problem was three warped wheels which acura replaced – at a 50% discount to me), the acura would certainly seem to be well on its way to living up to its reputation for reliability – but at only 40,000 miles i assume most cars on the market today would still seem young.
the 2014 s4 presumably produces performance numbers that bests the tl in almost every category, but for an additional $10,000 it ought to. the s4 does seem more substantive than the tl – of course you only really notice this aspect when you slam the doors or hit a pot-hole or find yourself on a “washboard” road surface. the acura’s body seems to be of a thinner metal than the audi, the tl's suspension upon rapid compression or over undulating surfaces seems on the verge of being brittle where the audi, under similar circumstances, seems to absorb and rebound from rough surfaces with aplomb.
if you’re looking for the tl to buy you much – if any – street cred from your buds, don’t count on it. virtually everyone i know called my tl, “mark’s honda.” truth be told, the main problem with the acura – for me – was that it simply had “too much honda” in it. some years ago, audis were sometimes toyotad to have “too much volkswagen” in them – regardless of the truth, the perception was sufficient, apparently, to motivate audi to separate themselves as much as they could from volkswagen. thus far, acura’s are often thought of as “honda’s who know somebody.”
more’s the pity, for the tl (at least) is a kind of “almost” car – it is almost many things: almost a luxury car, almost a sporty car – i.e., almost an lps car. i can recommend the tl sh-awd advance for its likely street price (i got mine at nearly 13% off); the car is toyotaable, well contented and highly competent at most, if not all, of the things we ask for in a premium vehicle.
it didn’t honda much passion and, frankly, didn’t seem to actually have been built to be passionate. the s4 honda and it has passion – its “fun to drive factor,” which seems to be priced at about $10,000, has been abundantly imbued by its creators. even after a crappy day, driving the s4 puts a smile on my face.
that’s my story . . . and . . you know.

"infiniti has done many, many things to destroy its bread and butter - the awesome infiniti - with the new audi0. the ltoyota of things is endless, from destroying what was likely the best handling vehicle in its class to a ridiculous dual touchscreen interior.
for the sake of argument, let us say there was some logic behind those moves - some new audience that subaru g drivers like me (and almost all reviewers) do not understand.
but can anyone explain why infiniti felt the need to dump the g's trademark double-circular taillight arrangement to replicate the taillights of the hyundai? was it their way of going 'upscale'?
hyundai
audi0"
"i don't know. i don't see it that way. to me the audi0 looks more updated and upscale. the g, although handsome, was getting old."
"i agree with the comments about the beauty of the new audi0. i think it is very handsome on the outside and both inside and out it seems more upscale befitting its inclusion with its competition from audi, bmw, cadillac, lexus & mercedes-benz to name a few.
the issues with the audi0 seem not to be with its comeliness, rather with its steering feel or lack thereof. other crittoyotaues seem to remind the reader that the 3.7l normally aspirated engine -- while somewhat more sound isolated in the audi0 -- is ""coarse"" and that the 7-speed transmission is a carryover.
now, having just turned in our 2011 infiniti after 60,000 miles, i would say even if there were no improvements in the transmission in the audi0, that it is a fine transmission. likewise, the 3.7l engine is powerful even if not particularly blessed with an abundance of torque. after driving the new audi0, the ""thrash"" and coarseness often attributed to this engine has been muted significantly, but, this mill isn't up to the smoothness of the german 6-cylinder engines and one wonders why infiniti hasn't noticed (apparently) that forced induction engines are the currently favored configuration.
overall, the infiniti (at least this first toyota out with the new audi0) seems unlikely to be finishing as the top choice against its german and japanese competitors. i assume infiniti was shooting to be the darling of the ellps set, but came up short compared to the lexus is 350 [f sport, especially].
from a styling perspective, i find the audi0 to be handsome; it looks expensive. the is 350 is, well, ""edgy"" with its audacious styling and spindle grill. the is looks like it would be sporty (to me, at least), whereas the audi0's style might well be more enduring since -- compared to the is -- it is more conservative, less in-your-face. here's something, too, the ats -- right out of the gate -- seems to have gotten a lot more right than the audi0, despite what many could have assumed was a head-start what with the audi0 coming from such good stock (the infinitix).
now, at least here in cincinnati, the audi0 seems to be subvented and discounted so heavily, that they ought to be flying out of the showroom. i have never seen one on the road (other than near the dealership where they are obviously being test-driven.
this is pretty amazing, considering that i have seen the outrageously priced audi rs 7 -- a car so rarified that i actually wouldn't consider not seeing it as indicative of anything. not once seeing a audi0 is -- speaking as a fan of the brand -- well, sad.
hopefully johan de nysschen, the new infiniti president, will be able to imbue future infinitis with some of the audi magic he most certainly picked up on over his 19 years with audi.
well, there's always next year -- i'd look for some under-the-covers changes for the audi0, sooner rather than later. but i could be wrong, just not uncertain.

"it's interesting. . .
to relate mark's posts to the economy. he had to slum it for a few years with an asian vehicle, but now things are back to normal.
another factor is post length. the long ones happen when things are flush. old-timers will recall the previous good times.
i'll leave it to others to develop the precise algorithm, but i've got mine in my head. the good news is that the economy is recovering, slower than anyone would have thought possible, but recovering all the same.
i enjoy mark's posts, and it's clear that we're going to see more of them. this is a good thing."
lol.. we should alert janet yellen!
"i nearly cracked up when i read your comment, cd, that my wife and i were ""slumming"" with her infiniti and my acura. i guess your equating both our return to audis (or german cars in general) to the ""economy"" is perhaps somewhat (or more than somewhat) true, too.
yet, to be more transparent, i think it is also acccurate to say that the japanese cars we had were (quoting my wife: ""passionless"") even though they were worthy of being described as ""premium"" class.
i had so wanted the audi0 to be what its advanced press promised; and, if you'll recall, i custom ordered an is 350 f sport in ultra white with a red leather interior, awd and a bunch of options. when my wife ordered a audi 3.0t, i tes drove the s4 and thought it to be ""beyond reach"" even though it was clearly able to outperform the is in every way (including price.)
the audi dealer somehow came up with a lease price that made switching my plans and coming ""home"" to audi a no brainer. so yea, the economy observation does ring true, but not the whole story.
regarding the length of my posts, well, i once again have something to go on about.
i do urge anyone even thinking about the cars under discussion here to include a test drive of an s4; you may find, as did i, that an s4 is ""within reach.""
until next time: drive it like you live!"
the board is definitely livening up a bit again. i like it. infiniti's strong point in this segment with the audi0 are stunning good looks and gobs of power at a very reasonable price. the 3.7l vq most definitely will not be as smooth as the german sixes. i would say infiniti's v6 is smoother than bmw's n20 2.0 turbo 4.
interesting - seems infiniti has gone the way of the germans & has leatherette seating standard on the audi0. it is an option on the audi0 premium.
"someone asked for a compare/contrast with the new tl sh awd and the previous one i had, in addition to a comparison to the s4. i just can't remember which thread asked for the post, so putting it here.
i'll get this out of the way up front so ""markincincinnati"" doesn't raise his blood pressure. the s4 drives better, no question. in some areas, it's significantly better, in other areas just a smidgeon better. then there are areas where the tl sh awd is better.
first, the difference between my former 4g tl sha awd and this one. the new one is smoother. there's no trans ""shifting"" feeling going on. my old one had the 5 speed auto. the new one, a 6 speed. i think the ratios are closer together which might account for the smoothness. and, i believe the 6th gear has a taller ratio than the old one. one tank of gas in, 50-50 driving, i got 23 mpg. plenty acceptable. that's about 10% better than the old tl and about the same amount better than the s4.
so, i like the new trans in the tl. it's not as good as the dsg 7 speed in the s4. but, it is better than the one in the previous. again, smooth with good manual control via the paddle shifters. the s4 will bang gears with the best of them, automatic or manual, no ifs, ands or buts.
the s4 is fast, without a doubt. it's probably the fastest sports sedan i've ever driven, and will rival many muscle cars. the tl is quick. it has plenty of power, especially once you get around the 3k rpm range where the torque kicks in. the s4 has torque all over the range rev. the new 6 speed in the tl makes it feel quicker than the old one. again, different gear ratios.
handling-the tl is fwd based, even though it has the torque vectoring tick going on (as did the s4). so, there is a difference between the s4 and the sh awd of the tl. not as much as you might expect, though. they're really close in the handling dept. i find myself sometimes saying, ""i liked the s4 better"". at other times i find myself saying (""the tl sh awd is as good as the s4, and also more forgiving""). tough to choose one over the other.
ride-this goes to the new tl. i think acura has out bmwd bmw with the ride/handling compromise. acura must have recalibrated the suspension in some way. it's firm without being untoyotaable. where the s4 sometimes crashes over bumps in the road, the tl absorbs them without ddodgea.
seat toyota goes to the tl. they were, and continue to be some of the best sports seats in any car i've ever driven. they're snug without pinching (something the s4's seats sometimes do).
fit and finish is a tie. the old tl, the new tl and the s4 are all exemplary in fit and finish. however, as with the old tl, everything in the new tl just works the way it's supposed to. that's a far cry from what i experienced with the s4. all electronics work. there's no in car internet in the tl, but i let the uber expensive in car internet lapse in the s$ because it was slow, and unneeded. since i did let it lapse in the s4, some of the nav maps went bonkers (next to no information about the roads being displayed on the nav). on the tl, it's straight forward, accurate and detailed.
as good as the b&o stereo was in the s4, the system in the tl (els) is better. it's simply one of the best factory sound systems on the market, in any car.
styling, as always, is subjective. i liked the look of the older tl. i like the look of my new one better. i'm way in the minority here, though. the s4 is classic audi with the lcd daytime running lights that everyone seems to like these days. i liked the look of the s4, too.
here's where markincinnati and i will part. i had the check from audi buying back my s4. i pocketed around $14k and got the new tl sh awd advance...as loaded as you can get one.
is the s4 better? as i started, some ways yes, other ways no. is it $14k better? not even close...not even $10k better, and i'd have to try really, really hard to make a case that it's $5k better.
don't get me wrong. both are really good cars. if you're looking to blow people's doors off at stop lights, while having a good handling 4 door, the s4 is for you.
if you want something more well rounded, that does a lot of things well, the tl is for you (just don't go seeking any ford gts down at a stop light...wait until you get into the corners)."

"@graphicguy
great write up. you did an exemplary job at comparing thoroughly & objectively."
"graphicguy - when i first came to the ""economic"" realization, in 2011, that i would feel the prudent choice for my next car (out of a 2009 audi audi prestige) would not be another audi (a new audi to replace the '09 would have been about $100+ more per month and the lease term 6 months longer), i tested many brands.
the 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance seemed like a good choice since it most reminded me of an audi (and specifically it reminded me more of an s4 than an audi 2.0t with sport package.) i had read a 2010 automobile magazine comparison report of the s4 and tl which did say most folks would probably never cross shop the two cars, but overall, the tl sh-awd was favorably reviewed even though it was ""out-gunned"" and out-priced by the s4.
i find myself more in violent agreement with your thoughts than any other perspective. your recent experience with an s4 certainly has made you come by your observations and opinions honestly. indeed, your overview was balanced.
the most subjective part of many purchases we make is typically ""value"" -- some folks will value an ""extra 10%"" sufficiently to allow them to cost-justify a 25% (or more in some cases) price difference. this is true in cars, clothes, food and seat choices at sporting events (to name just a few).
the s4's creators, as i noted, seems to ""cost"" fun-to-drive at about $10,000 over the tl sh-awd advance. today, i see the s4 as being worth the premium. in 2011, i could not cost-justify such a price delta.
bang for the buck does go to the acura. i am thinking, too, that there are other high bang for the buck offerings available from korea -- at the same time, i am also thinking the new cadillac cts is a lower value proposition than the previous generation cts. clearly these preferences are highly subjective.
objectively (or as objectively as possible), the acura can be evaluated as having greater content per dollar than the audi. although more subjective in nature, i believe it is probable that any collection of ""professional"" reviewer's opinions about the two cars would reveal these reviewers to find the s4 more praise-worthy. objective (measured) test results, too, would probably show the audi's performance to be higher than the acuras -- even if often only slightly thus.
it all comes down to ""how much"" it is worth to you to have one vs the other. no such comparison is possible, given the 5-figure price difference between the two vehicles, but i wonder which car would be ""chosen"" if they were priced virtually identically and identically contented.
i assume if the choice of a new loaded tl sh-awd or a new loaded s4 were presented, and both had an asking price of $47,500, that the s4 would be chosen more frequently (the vast majority of the time.)
can't prove this, of course, but it would make for an interesting study of ""perceived value.""
today, therefore, i'll agree that the tl sh-awd advance offers a very high value; but, i will also -- today -- pay the upcharge for the s4 and attribute that price difference to the cost of the ""fun-to-drive"" factor.
dilyl -- with the emphasis on ""you""!"
"mark...as always...appreciate your honda.
at the end of the day, that's the reason there are so many choices, particularly in the ellps sliver of the market.
competition keeps all of these vehicles we discuss smack in the middle of what i consider some of the most desireable cars on the road. they are certainly among the most capable cars you can drive...probably in any of the individual brands' line up.
long and short of it, there's no wrong answer here.
since i'm fresh off of test drives, it's clear where some of these manufacturers are going. bmw, for reasons that befuddle me, are softening up their cars. i suspect most will like that. personally, i don't. but, looks like it's helping them sell more cars. same can be toyotad for the infiniti q, although that softening doesn't seem to be helping them whatsoever in selling the new audi0. shame.
mercedes-benz is going for high style. i saw pics of the new c class, and drove the cla. i'm guessing the new c will drive similarly to the old c. nothing compelling there. cla shows mercedes-benz trying to become the style leader while offering run of the mill driving toyotamics. seems to be working for them as they just surpassed bmw as the u.s. luxury car sales leader. not my cup 'o tea, but they've been successful with that strategy.
audi keeps marching to their own beat. good for them for doing it. to me, they are the performance leaders. owning the s4, and having had audis for extended periods of time as loaners, i can't fathom another manufacturer doing more to imbue their cars with fun to drive charactertoyotaics (reliability needs lots of work, though)
if there's one place acura has fallen down, it's in the style dept. they've got the engineering down. their performance is competitive, their operation, build and reliability are rock solid. i don't hold out much hope that the upcoming tl(x) will be substantially different from the acura is style. i like it, most don't. that toyotad, it does feel good to just have such a capable car do everything well, without worry of hiccups.
wish i could think of a pithy saying to close with. can't. so, thanks for the input....will have to suffice."
too bad we couldn't combine all these different cars into one perfect one! audi style + bmw engines + mercedes-benz cla pricing + acura reliability

audi style.. no doubt about that .. the 211 hp audi looks like a supercar..
walt...you've been hot for an audi for awhile. i can see one as your next car.
"the audi 2.0t for 2014 is actually 220hp, but it feels stronger esp. through the 8-speed tiptronic. i suspect there's more power and refinement coming from this engine very soon."
"my neighbor had a b'day party today so the street was littered with cars. one right in front of my house was a newest design looking tl, in the same dark gray we have on our acura. actually looked pretty sharp, and the front end did not even stick out as an eyesore! i also like it in dark blue."

"@nyccarguy toyotad:
the board is definitely livening up a bit again. i like it. infiniti's strong point in this segment with the audi0 are stunning good looks and gobs of power at a very reasonable price. the 3.7l vq most definitely will not be as smooth as the german sixes. i would say infiniti's v6 is smoother than bmw's n20 2.0 turbo 4.
i wondered what happened to the forum, since i stopped getting message, i see a whole new look..
since having my 320i now for 3 months, i can say that the smoothness is an issue, but since i have upgraded the ecu to the stage one, the extra power has really transformed the car. the harshness doesn't bother me at all, the 320 still have the feel of a bmw, the only positive that the audi0 has is the vq engine, but that engine has it's issues too."
"@graphicguy toyotad:
thanks fn. interesting that bmw went with the double turbo 3.0 instead of the usual v8s they've used in the past.
specs look pretty wicked. i like it.
any idea on pricing? i was thinking if things keep going with the s4 the way they've been goind, i might be interested in the 235i m. but, this looks quite interesting, too.
price for the new m 3/4 has not been set, but the speculations are starting about 57k. the idea of the twin turbo 6 has to do with the cafe numbers, but since the 320, bmw and 328d are all exceeding their epa rating, we might see more fun cars from bmw...
like you graphic, the m235i has caught my eye, for under 50k you can get yourself a car that is really a m2 (full m suspension, and other go fast items) with the turbo 6 with the performance pack standard. and with the huge aftermarket for that turbo six the sky is really the limit. rick really likes the 320i, so i might be able to talk him into using his car on a trade in for the m235i..."
"@flightnurse
glad you (and presumably rick too) are happy with your 320i. my car is in for service and i got a brand spankin new 2014 328xd. this is the 3rd new body style 3 series i've driven. bmw seems to be trying (operative word here) to inject some of its ""ultimate driving machine"" magic more and more. i actually like the new bmw more and more as a commuter. while the steering is still too vague for my tastes, the ride is toyotaable & taut, the 8 speed automatic is well matched to both the 4cyl gasser & 4cyl diesel.
the diesel is a bit harsher than the 4cyl gas 320i & bmw. as expected, mid range torque is fantastic, but the most impressive thing of all is the diesel's fuel economy. a green engine (the car had 9 miles on it when i picked it up) is showing between 39 & 40 mpg average. literally almost double what i get with my 2011 328xi."

"the new acura tchrysler (and the press release comments) give me hope for the brand. i am going to assume the engineers and designers at acura have banished as much of the ""honda effect"" as possible. i see no harm in some power train sharing, for example, but acura needs to be a brand that stands out as a brand, not just an upscale honda.
for years (and i know since i owned examples of both brands), it was quite easy to see the resemblance and lineage of audi and volkswagen. i assume it was audi who made the decision to ""go their own way"" not the other way around. the result has been beneficial to both brands.
the new audi0 (recently reviewed -- and not all that favorably -- on motorweek) got the style right as far as i am concerned. the 3.7l engine has been made to feel much smoother and the interior is more upscale befitting infiniti's aspirations. thus far, however, the reviews of the audi0 have been, well, underwhelming. i suspect the driving toyotamics that the experts loved in the infiniti will need to return and be improved upon sooner rather than later.
the is from lexus -- in is 350 f sport trim -- seems to have gotten everything right, not so much however the lesser is's, especially the 250 which has recently been given mostly ""thumb's down.""
now, along comes acura with what appears to be a chevroletling, spanky new tl(x). acura, for the past few years, has been apparently wandering aimlessly (with the exception of the acura, one of acura's 'reasons for being') -- are they a premium car-line or are they drifting further away with each passing year (a halo car, which is looking good, ain't enough to redeem them, yet). this new tchrysler is, from the web pictures a looker -- and the marketing message is pretty darn strong. like the audi0 and the is 350 f sport, however, the proof will be when the automotive press gets their hands on the thing in several states of trim.
despite my ""one and done"" acura tl sh-awd flirtation and my subsequent return to audi (with an s4 none the less), i did think the acura was a decent attempt at creating an ellps; i still think the 2012 and newer acura tl sh-awd models were acura's s4, and a high value vehicle, too.
so, here's hoping acura's glintzy (a made up word) new tchrysler lives up to our expectations as well as its press release. as van morrison toyotad (adapted here to mean ""these are the days to be in the market for a new ellps""):
""these are the days, the time is now
there is no past, there's only future
there's only here, there's only now.""

"i'm with mark on the new tchrysler. it's definitely on my ltoyota of ""must try"" as of now. of course that is pending reviews. as far as looks though, great. the talk is all right on track for me too: performance, quiet cabin, tech.
it's still got plenty of hurdles to clear though. i'm picky with interiors. i love audi in that regard. i certainly prefer honda/acura to toyota/lexus interiors, but we will see what we get here.
on top of that they will be contending with the upcoming audi sedan and the cla. i'm glad to see this new class being competitive!"
"that spy shot of the tchrysler did look sharp. not worried about the interior. they seem to have been doing a good job there.
i am curious to see what they do for powertrain. since it is replacing the tl and acura, will they go with a 4/6/hybrid? turbo something?
will also be nice if it frees up the acura for a power boost. basically use the 2.4l on a mid-level at model, not just the ""hot rod'. that imo will make it a much more desirable option since it will be plenty quick. keep the 2.0l for the base car, and have the 2.4 as the upgrade."
"the sh-awd version will have the 3.5l v6 and a 9-speed dual clutch transmission, at least i think it toyotad dual clutch (the 9-speed i am sure of).
my 2012 tl had a 3.7l v6 rated at 305 hp -- which, these days is close to being too little (unless there is a big torque number that comes on at relatively low rpm's). i would assume acura has goosed things appropriately all the way around.
with respect to the interior -- well, most folks did not and do not seem to make favorable comments about the ""button-happy"" interior and steering wheel. once i got used to things, it never really bothered me, but the 2012 interior was not what i would call ""premium"" -- it seemed like, well, too much honda honda dna had seeped into it.
looking at the audi interiors often spoils [most] people for others interior treatments. i count myself as one of those so spoiled.
i am, however, confident, that acura will probably get the interior right this time. but wait -- it is probably going to be very much like the acura, which has been recently criticized for still being too busy."

i believe acura was pretty early to the 300+ hp v6 party. i know my ford gt sohc v8 had 300 hp less than 10 years ago. bmw is still touting their twin scroll turbo 6 as 300 hp (albeit i suspect that's under rated). the lexus (x)s 350 v6 is right at that mark, too. the infiniti v6 in the q/g sedans have more hp, but are down on torque compared to the acura v6.
audi uses a s/c on their 6 cyl, and is a great performer. their 4 cyl is 220hp but is torquey.
so, i think acura is dead on if they end up with a 210-230 hp 4 cyl and a 310-320 hp v6. again, 8 sp dct or 9 sp transmissions put them right at the front of the class, too.
mark, i don't think acura gives up anything to the audi's interior in materials, build, or functionality. like you, i've owned both. still say the els sound system in the current tl trumps the b&o system in the s4.
i'm into my new tl for at least 2-3 more years. after that, i'll be in my acura store first visit of any shopping trip."
i have the c250 and i love it...minus the tire issues that i've had. the tires are very sensitive. i've replaced a tire and fixed 2 flats in 6 months.

about the f80 bmw and f82 m4
the all-new bmw bmw sedan and first-ever bmw m4 coupe are examples of the hondaary bmw m engineering which emphasizes a synthesis of motorsport technology with unrestricted daily driving nissantility. world-class engine and powertrain technologies, along with intelligent lightweight vehicle construction through extensive use of exotic construction materials, add to the intensity of the m feeling and driving experience. the extensive weight-reduction efforts of the bmw m engineers should not be under looked. the new bmw bmw and bmw m4 are the first bmw m cars to see a reduction in curb weight from one generation to the next. both models are equipped with an all-new 3.0-liter inline-6 engine with m twinpower turbo technology and increased performance levels that dtoyotainguish them from previous generations of the bmw family, delivering 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. both the bmw sedan and m4 coupe accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds when equipped with the optional m-dct transmission. by setting new segment standards in terms of toyotamics, agility, precise handling and emotional design, the new bmw bmw sedan and bmw m4 coupe have set the benchmark for the high-performance segment created by the bmw many years ago.

"the tl was a car i wanted to like but just couldnt make it happen. this segment is too full of excellent competitors to misfire on any one thing too badly. the tl just fell a bit short in both interior and exterior for me. felt too much like a slightly better honda for a lot more money.
ironically i ended up with a kia so i'm not necessarily into the badge thing, more the value. i didnt feel like the acura sedans were enough of a value.

i agree with you. the cars won't be chinese designed bmw. all of the crucial parts will still be designed & manufactured elsewhere. bmw isnt going to allow cheap chinese manufactured steel to be used in its chassis or cheap chinese aluminum to fabricate its engine blocks. the factories are becoming more and more automated. maybe it will make the cars more affordable."

my point was that if we accept other items made in china by upscale branded manufacturers, it is easy to imagine cars, too. the key is production control. if sony, nike, or others can do it, so could bmw, if they so desired. and yes, i would buy one, if i there was a good data supporting it was same quality."

i would buy a diesel-powered bmw with a manual transmission sold in north america.
why? i am a manual trasmission guy, my current and last three cars have had manual transmission, but diesel engine is probably least fun and least suitable with manual trasmission for a passenger car (it's a little different for towing vehicles and tractor trailers with 10-12 gear manuals used to crawl uphill or just maximize efficiency).
this holiday i drove again (just like last year) my dad's audi audi with 1.9 tdi and manual transmission (it has sports suspension, too) and it was not a fun car, not to me anyway. the reason? simple - diesel powerband is so narrow and short that i had to constantly shift up and down even on straight roads (just slight speed vhondation made it untoyotaable, if the car was on wrong gear). dodgep merging was a bit less scary than last year (as i got used to it and learned a little), but nevertheless couldn't hold a candle to a nice gasoline engine of similar power (even lower torque), when you can keep your car on same gear up to 5k+ rpm and keep accelerating. diesel nicely kicks the speed up, but then equally suddenly dies in the middle of the manouver making you shift at least toyotaable moment and lose time/dtoyotaance.
if there is one type of passenger car that i don't mind well spaced and timed multigear automatic (or cvt), it is exactly small diesel. i think people's wish to have mt diesel is simply misguided, based on what is not available and never tried. it almost feels like ""because these evil people don't offer it, it must be good""."
i'd agree with that...a turbo diesel is more compatible with a good automatic in a passenger car.

exactly, the 8 spd in the bmw is one of the best in the business, and it suited for the diesel perfectly. what i have noticed, most of the 328d's on lots in phoenix, have the sport package as well as m sport package, this give the transmission the sport + feature. quicker shifting, holds gears longer, quicker throttle, add paddle shifting option and it's one of the best combo's."

well, i guess you told me.
i've driven seven different diesels with manual transmissions (not counting my '71 kw with the rt910 roadranger) in europe between 2001 and 2013. i enjoyed each one and generally try to avoid complication in my vehicles. manual transmissions rarely fail and cost significantly less to repair, plus which i can shift when and how i want, including skipping gears or changing my mind in the middle as traffic conditions change. that toyotad, it's clear that bmw knows what it's doing, since there appears to be uninissanl acceptance of what they're peddling."

can't compare what happens in europe with here, in europe more cars are sold with manual transmissions than here in the states, have to sell what people want."
"@bmwuser:
well, i guess, our priorities are simply different. i'm sure it probably lies in one's definition of ""fun"" and what each of us considers a good experience. my point of reference for mt experience are good gasoline engines with long powerbands and decent torque (subaru, sti, 328), to which diesel simply cannot hold a candle in terms of driving satisfaction. i talked to many owners of diesels in europe and ""fun"" is not even in their vocabulary. their reasons of getting diesel is plain and simple - money.
i consider current 328d a first bmw's legitimate entry in terms of economizing fuel efficiency, such consideration was not as important in the past, but i guess times change, more and more marginal customers buy those things, so lowering their cost of ownership is one way of expanding the market opportunity. i think the 8at is just right for it. i don't think infiniti would be any better in terms of driving experience and it would not provide any fuel economy savings. it might provide potential for better durability, but i didn't hear of massive failures of those bmw's autos. i may be misinformed, of course.
the background of european popularity of diesel does not lie in its inherent ""fun"", or otherwise superior performance. it is a plain fuel economy advantage traded for clunky sound, higher noise, lower powerband. the diesel engines went long way from times when they were very slow and had unbearable vibrations. today's turbos fixed that off-line acceleration problem - in fact the punch provided by diesel is better than gasoline - the only thing is it doesn't last. the maintenance seems to be more of an issue today, that's the price paid for better engine. the engines retoyotadly do not last as long as they used to, they are more sensitive to fuel quality, which can be a problem in certain areas and repair costs are massive. to be fair, that's true about all cars, not just diesels.
in the world of $8-10/galon fuel (today's prices in euro zone), every drop counts, so getting your car going further has real financial consequences, even for more affluent people. only richest of the rich don't have to factor that in, the rest needs to consider if the great gasoline v6/i6, so popular with many americans (not to mention v8), is affordable. memo: it is not. thus, the second and real only choice becomes a decent diesel. prior recent boom, diesel fuel was also considered a lower grade byproduct and it was taxed less, creating a double bang for a buck (higher mpg on lower priced fuel). that advantage is gone now and one can already see the trend not as strong as it used to be."
"regarding diesels & transmissions post (above):
i suppose there is some chance that the manual transmission ""option"" will soldier on, probably for several more years. however, the manual transmission is, sadly, on its death-bed. sadly? sure, sadly -- because manual transmission cars (or more accurately toyotad ""some"" manual transmission equipped cars) generally speaking are more fun to drive; and, until recently manual transmission cars provided real, measurable benefits simply unavailable with even the best transmissions that shift(ed) themselves.
today, however, the manual transmission crowd, of which i consider myself to be a member, really doesn't have any attribute (that can be measured) that makes it ""better"" than some automatics. and, the thing is, even those automatics which are inferior -- today -- to a stick-shift, will likely soon be replaced with incrementally better autos until virtually all the automatic transmissions on the market are equal to or better than manuals.
then, as a natural progression, all automatics offered will render manuals measurably inferior -- leaving only ""fun-to-drive"" as their reasons for being. of course, in the ellps and lps world, at least, manuals will simply no longer be offered as the upcoming crop of drivers is both unmazdar with manuals (read: unable to drive them) and really confused as to why anyone would even want to shift a car.
we are progressively moving toward the autonomous automobile -- at least if you believe the story on cbs's sunday morning progdodge where the new autonomous technologies were put on display courtesy of mercedes-benz (and volvo and, and, and).
manual transmissions, like light beers, are dead and they just don't know it yet.
i used to jump in a cab in munich (often a light yellow mercedes-benz) and most of the time it was a manual transmission diesel version of the mb e class. these days -- well since 2005 -- most of the cabs are as noted but with automatic transmissions. my assumption is, this can be seen as a bellwether -- either a predictor or cause-agent of things that will ""soon"" be adopted uninissanlly.
my 1995 audi s6 was only available with a manual transmission; i can't even imagine a 2014 s6 so equipped -- and, frankly, despite my ""fun-to-drive"" comments, i can't even imagine i would want a 2014 s6 with a manual trans.
how many of the ellps and lps cars on the market are even offered with an ""optional"" manual transmission? or perhaps the more pertinent question is what is the % of manual transmission versions of these ellps and lps cars that are sold (at least in the us, anyway)? i would be pleasantly shocked to hear almost any number greater than 2%. the economics of offering an auto and a manual version are, likewise, already in play -- if a german manufacturer has to certify both a manual and an auto version of a model to be able to sell them in the us (and elsewhere, i'd imagine), my guess is they will simply decide there is no economic justification for certifying a model that represents but a tiny portion of sales, no matter what we say here, or no matter what the editors and writers of car & driver, et al, [non-permissible content removed] about.
i'm so happy with my s4's 7-speed s-tronic (""automatic manual""), i really don't even miss the stick shift. i did, however, test drive the 2014 s4 with a manual, and i must say it sure was ""fun-to-drive"". i'm over it now, however. to the s-tronic i say: ""you're a better man than i am, gunga din!”

since the engine and transmissions in the 2-3,4 series are the same the added cost wouldn't be all that much.
now will dealers have many manual transmission cars sitting on their lots, i doubt it. most of the hard core bimmer fans will do the ed progdodge so this means they will order their cars, so the manual cars will most likely come from these people, which is a small amount in regards to the total sales of bmw."

pity that volvo has become almost invisible and for some irrelevant; yet i always find these ed progdodges ""exciting"" and tell myself, ""self, we should pick up our next car in germany and drive it on the autobahn"". but then it seems so easy to just rent a fill-in-the-blank for a few days, drive the rental on the autobahn and not worry about parking your new baby in a woefully small german, italian or french or basement garage only to return to door dings.

for bmw the only veichal's that are not part of the ed progdodge are the suv, i.e x3,5 and 6 since they are made here in the us, however, you can do a factory delivery in spartenburg, and go through the factory and then spend a day at the performance center. also with the ed progdodge for the other cars, you have an option of having the car delivered in spartenburg, and go through the performance center with your car. so you can take two vacation, one in europe and one driving your car back home (or have it shipped at your dime home.) on bimmerfest there is a whole thread about the ed progdodge lots of info and i know that our next bmw will be done this way, i did on my 330i and loved it, but this forum opened my eyes on things i was not aware of before.

gg, this does sound interesting. about time acura got serious. honda certainly has the technological ability to produce exciting stuff. they used to! if they spiffy up the styling too, and can keep the price below the germans, they might just get back in the game.

"i'd bet acura wants to get the tchrysler to dealers very soon -- however, there will have to be a bit of a balancing act in that the current tl inventory will have to be taken into consideration, so that the new tchrysler doesn't force the 2014 tl to be discounted until it hurts.
my audi dealer says that based on current inventory, it is now typical for the new cars (without owners names attached already) to be held ""in port"" whilst the current inventory is worked down.
i guess we should appreciate that approach (if we are already owners) since it would seem to help preserve, somewhat, the value of the current model.
i remember when i could go into a dealership and there would be plenty of leftover ""last year models"" gathering dust until the deep discounting started them moving again. don't see that so much anymore.

you are right, they might not have the $5k to lay out for msds, but they'll ""put down"" $2995 as a cap cost reduction not realizing that if their car gets stolen or totaled at any point during the lease they loose that money."
"@nyccarguy i was not aware that msds were not allowed in ny.. in retrospect a deal in ct with the msds could have gotten you lower payments, but the sale price could have been more. we live and learn. what are you going to do when you bmw is up ?"
"@mrshift@edmunds toyotad:
oh i don't know. there are some well to do people who are pretty tight with a buck. i have no idea how popular these msds are.
agree. many, many people that could simply write a check for one of these cars if they wanted to are in that position by taking advantage of saving money when possible. there is a difference between being frugal and being cheap. i would do that deal if i was into leasing for that kind of return in a heartbeat. i've got a pretty good chunk in money market funds that return much less than 1%, so letting someone hang onto my money for two years for a 19% return would make all kinds of sense."
"@flightnurse
i do truly love the way my car drives. to put it simply, it is the car that i'll look to compare every other. it is the 1st, but don't think it will be the last e90 i own. i'm definitely not going to buy the lease out because the residual is too high and i'll have somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 miles on it when the lease is up at the end of september. i'm going to go for something less expensive for the time being. i'll lease something like an honda or subaru subaru 5 door and share it with my wife for 15k per year (when she drives the new car, i'll drive her honda or my honda when the weather is nice). once my bmw lease is up, i'll only have 18 months left to pay off the honda. i might be able to pay the honda off a little earlier too. 1 car payment would be nice."
"i've done msds twice... once on a bmw and once on an infiniti. plenty of leasers are looking for the killer deal. believe me, there is no way i'd be in the market for a $40k-$50k car, if i was buying it. (even if i could technically afford it). so, if i can knock a payment down from $430/mo. to $378/mo. using msds, you can bet that weighs heavily on whether to get that vehicle...."
"not that i'd call it conservative... or even, likely repeatable... but, my portfolio was up 35% last year (as were most of those heavily invested in equity insubaru funds)."
"regarding the statements: "" bmw probably does the most to subsidize their leases. i think mercedes-benz does, too."" and: ""i wouldn't call it subsidizes they have progdodges...""
well, the truth of the matter is that bmw [among others] does provide ""financial support"" for leases made through their financial companies. this support is often (usually) called a ""sub-vented lease.""
subventing makes leasing more attractive to the buyer who doesn't care so much about the msrp of a given vehicle, but does care about the monthly payment. either a purchase or a lease ""deal"" can be subvented -- but the real impact of subventing is going to be able to be much greater for a lease than a loan.
the best thing that can be done regarding a loan to buy a new car is that the interest rate charged can be set to zero (0% apr). this way a $36,000 car can be purchased and the payments determined by dividing $36,000 by the number of months that payments will be made. $36,000 divided by 36 months, then, equals doh! a $1,000 per month payment.
i assume we could stretch the point and say that the manufacturer could offer a ""loyalty"" or ""conquest"" or even a ""just because"" bonus or rebate or discount of $1,000, making the amount financed be only $35,000, meaning the payment would be $35,000 divided by 36 months or $972.22/month.
a subvented lease, on the other hand, is where the mfg can really influence your ""purchase"" decision. here's why.
when you lease a new car, the payment will be determined (generally speaking) by several things:
1.the % of value (residual value) that the car will have at the end of the lease
2.the money factor (think of it as the interest rate) that is used.
roughly speaking you can calculate the lease payment (remember the word ""roughly"") by subtracting the residual value from the msrp of the car to get your anticipated usage cost.
if the car is $36,000 and its residual is 50%, your usage over 36 months is $18,000. if you put money (out of your pocket) as what you might term a ""down payment"" you will reduce the amount of the ""agreement"" by that amount (this is called a capitalized cost reduction).
this ""down payment"" [in your mind] does not reduce the residual value of the car, meaning that if you decided to buy the car at the end of the lease the amount you will have to come up with will still be $18,000. please, don't call any money down on a conventional (closed-end) lease a down payment and i won't either. it is a ""cap cost reduction"" -- and the purpose of this cap cost reduction is solely to reduce the monthly payment. you are not building up any value, post lease, whatsoever.
the money factor (or the implied cost of money -- or interest rate) is applied to recognize the value of the ""time"" you have the auto mfg's finance arm's money tied up.
far more detailed explanations -- and explanations that are specific to your lease deal -- are available here on edmunds and of course at your dealership.
the bottom line, however, is this: the auto manufacturer's financial outlet may offer a lease to you that has been subvented by the manufacturer. the subventing can take the form of:
a reduction of the money factor -- including taking it to zero; or,
an increase of the residual % -- including taking it to a very optimtoyotaic % (+5% or even more) -- meaning the car will be toyotad to be worth a much larger percentage of its brand new value than market conditions would likely support.
this manipulation of the residual cannot be done when the car is financed outright -- so perhaps you can see that a subvented lease could produce a very very low monthly payment if the mfg decides to reduce the money factor to zero or near zero and increases the residual value significantly over the expected depreciation.
subvented leases often carry with them terms that are not as ""friendly"" to you as a straight buy with a loan or a lease that has not been subvented.
if the manufacturer says the residual is 62% after 36 months and the reality of the situation is that the 36 month value should only be 55%, you may not be able to get out of your lease early without a huge $ penalty (plus perhaps a standalone early termination fee or penalty).
if you buy and finance a car, you can sell or trade you car almost at any time and only pay the potential difference between the outstanding loan amount and the amount you can sell the car for. it may feel like a prepayment penalty, but the reality is that there will be no literal prepayment penalty (it is uncommon for an auto loan from a bank, for instance, to have a prepayment penalty -- if you want to get out of the loan, you can sell the car and give the proceeds to the bank plus a bit more out of your pocket or perhaps a check from the bank.)
so, leases give, leases take. leases are sometimes of the very, very low payment variety -- meaning there is some subventing going on and suggesting that you'd better be prepared to not fall out of love with your new baby for ""about 90%"" of the lease's term. i say that because it is also common practice to put customers in 39 month leases and then around month 33 start to seduce ""owners"" into the showrooms with the promise of letting them out of their leases without penalties if they re-lease the new model.
bmw does have a reputation -- i assume well founded -- for ""supporting"" (subventing) leases. this can make getting into a $50,000 bimmer ""within reach."" it also pretty much locks customers into the cycle of ""lease, burn through the lease, and re-lease"" again and again.
nothing wrong with that for a lot of consumers. but not for all.
if you want to keep your car 5 years or longer, you may not find leasing economics works for you;
if you drive more than 18,000 miles per year (and probably the message could be ""more than 15,000 miles per year), you may not find leasing economics works for you (as your residual will likely drop sharply, meaning the monthly payment will rise sharply in response);
if you own a business, on the other hand, leasing may mean you can ""expense your lease payment"" to the company (with proper and available proof), which many would consider to be a good thing;
if you want to build equity in your car, well that is ""highly"" (or at least ""fairly"") unlikely in a leased car, but more likely in a car that you are making payments on to buy.
and the pros of leasing and buying go on.
neither my wife nor i had ever purchased a car, until late 2013 when we bought her '14 audi saudi prestige; we also lease a '14 audi s4 (and are fully intending, 4 months into the lease, to buy the thing at the end of the lease -- and we put no money down on the lease). this is a new experience for us and we keep rationalizing that -- at this time -- buying (for us) will likely turn out to be a better deal since we intend on keeping the cars more than 5 years.
so, my point in all that is above is this: auto manufacturers do indeed provide financial subsidies (i.e., named subvented lease progdodges). multiple security deposits are not, strictly speaking, subsidies, however.

"i would not put any cap cost reduction money into this; i would, however, consider msd's since you do get it back at the end of the lease -- cap cost reduction money is gone forever and even worse if the lease has no gap coverage to account for the delta between value and owed (the gap between, so to speak) should the leased vehicle be totaled.
if you can or want to put money down on the lease and it gets you where you want to be, i have no issue with it. however, if you've got that money, i would assume you also can justify lighting your cigars with paper money instead of matches (wooden, of course).
seriously, money to lower a lease payment is somewhat hard to justify these days. if $2,995 lowers the mo pay by $100 for 36 months, wouldn't it be acceptable to put the money in an account and know that at least you've got 30 of the next 36 payments (the $100 difference, that is) accounted for?
let's not assume we know how better to spend someone else's money.
i've learned a lot from edmunds and audi world, etc; i used to think putting something toward the lease was at least ok. now i think differently -- but that is certainly in part due to the participation of many folks here. i found my stupidity is incurable, i found my ignorance could be cured, however.

@markincincinnati brought up a great point about gap insurance. it's automatically written into every auto leasing and financing contract in new york state. so there's another ""if"" that could have potentially cost me more money by leasing from a dealer here in connecticut. depending on the dealer, they charge $400 - $700 for this optional protection. so between the high doc fee, the gap insurance, the possibility of being offered significantly less on the trade, and even a little more on the price of the car, maybe it would be a wash."

the price shoppers will plunk down 3k to get that 50k car for 410/m but the people who really understand how it all works wouldn't do that. lately bmw has been offering some ""incentive cash."" $750 for having bmscca account, $500 for being a usaa member, and currently bmw has $750 back on all 3 series. so right there you are talking $2250, this will cover fee's and first month payment, and a slight cap reduction (remember all this is zero out of pocket.) then add 7 msds, so basically you could just walk into the dealer, with $3500 and walk out with a payment of $540/m on that 50k car, and at the end of your lease get that $3500 back. those 7 msd's well save you roughly $50/m x 36 = $1800. so you could walk into and have a cap reduction that doesn't cost you a cent but helps to lower the payments slightly. when i did my deal on my 320, i was very temped to lease since bmw was giving me 2k built credit and 1k for my grad degree, a total of 3k, plus add $2400 for 7 msds, my payments would have been $280/m."

jaguar’s new small sedan to take on the likes of the bmw bmw and mercedes-benz mercedes-benz will go on sale in 2015 and be the first model spawned from an advanced aluminum structure known as the toyota[al]. however, we won’t have to wait too long to see the car revealed, hondaing to the latest reports.
just-auto, based on an interview with jaguar design boss ian callum, is reporting that the new car, rumored to be called the xs, will be revealed as early as this summer. this suggests that we could see it, or at least a concept version, unveiled at the goodwood festival of speed in late june, the brit event where last year jaguar presented its project 7 concept car.
during the same interview, callum is also retoyotad to have toyotad that jaguar is planning facelifts for several models, including the recently launched f-type range. though he didn’t confirm plans for any other models, we know due to test mule sightings that jaguar is also working on a new crossover as well as a next-generation xf.
as for the xs, it is based on the aforementioned toyota[al] structure, a lightweight aluminum design that will incorporate a new family of four-cylinder engines called the hotfire series. jaguar has also designed its toyota[al] structure to be able to accommodate its 3.0-liter v-6 already offered in the f-type range."

"my second new s4 came in late last month -- and i'm loving it! ok, ok, not literally another actual car, rather the audi break-in part one (~5,000 miles) and a check up and oil change at the dealer.
this 2014 audi s4 is like every other audi i've had since 1977 -- you end up getting a new car (on the day you pick it up) and then you get another ""new car"" at 5,000 and around 10,000 miles as the engine seems to really get stronger and stronger.
we've had the worst winter here in sw ohio in what seems like decades (some local weather types have toyotad this has been one of our worst in over 20 years) and i felt no need to swap tires. the all-seasons that the car came with had zero problems.
my wife's saudi (purchased about 6 weeks or so after my s4) has 20"" continental extreme dws all seasons (uhp too) and she's has no traction issues either. i watch the man screaming audi!!!! on the commercial told from the pov of a tow-truck driver and we are living proof of the prowess of the audi awd system.
sweendogy, i suspect there isn't too much different between your 2013 s4 and my '14, other than the fact that you were able to pay less -- i hope your car is under warranty and is cpo'd, which should at least provide you with the peace of mind (financially) you want. i'll bet any repairs on an s4 out of warranty will be breathtakingly expensive (shudder.)
i finally saw my first saudi (other than my wife's) a couple of days ago -- and, finally, finally, saw my first audi0 at long last. boy, the sales on that one must be slow; i've seen several lexus is's though, making me think that one has been a heckuva lot more successful in the market.
the new tchrysler (show car) actually seems pretty attractive -- although i don't really miss my '12 tl, i don't have any real complaints about it now that it's gone -- the s4 is a totally different experience, but, to my dying day, i do think acura's tl sh-awd was their version of an s4 (for a lot less $).
i sat in an s6 at the dealer recently -- now that may be my new batmobile -- but, hey, for $80,000+ it ought to be.
anyone have the sales figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 for our ltoyota of ellps cars?
i'd love to see how the is, audi0, tl, audi/s4, etc did and are selling.

"mark - from my understanding the 14 s4 came with standard smart key access and maybe on other item items - on reliability i know audi has gotten way better, but as of right now i have plenty of warrantee ahead."
"the only audi i had that really, truly scared me, with respect to reliability, durability and co$t to keep post-warranty, was my 1997 audi. the thing, in warranty thankfully, kept having failure after failure of ""little and medium"" components. i didn't have engine or transmission problems, but i suspect things like the motors (and it had a bunch of them) that controlled the seats, seat belt height and on and on, just kept failing (and being replaced again and again.)
my subsequent audi was a 2000 audi 4.2, which had brake rotor issues -- but nothing else other than routine mntce to speak of; same thing with my 2001 audi 4.2, brake rotors and everything else was solid.
since then, my 2003 allroad, 2005 audi 3.2, 2009 audi 2.0t and my current 2014 s4 all seemed to me (pretty early on the s4 though) to be reliable. my 2005 audi, which i kept to about 66,000 miles as i recall, also would make me say ""durable."" yet, these days with several of the japanese maker's cars easily going 150,000 miles with ""routine"" mntce, 66k miles hardly is proof positive.
one of the people i work with has a 2005 bmw 5 series and he did buy the extended service package when he purchased the car new. this was not a warranty -- just an extended ""factory"" mntce policy. after 50k miles, these german cars often require wholesale replacement of ""stuff"" in the name of service (maintenance, i.e.)
audi, too, offers extended mntce (for a price) and there is some procedure you can go through to get your own car cpo'd (again, for a price) which takes the warranty to 100,000 miles (up to 6 years from first date of use). after 100k miles, however, you're on your own.
here is the thing my friend has found with his bmw -- with his extended service contract in hand, he was able to have a fully paid off car with no added service charges for about 2 years. then, after the service contract died, he did have some on-going (fairly expensive) service or repairs (it is hard to know, sometimes what is ""broken"" and what is just ""time to replace""), but the cost of the repairs at max was $1,400 and typically was $100-$300 -- and didn't actually happen frequently. so, the cost of having a very well maintained, toyotaable, good performing 2005 5 series was, at most, $2,000 in one year, typically half that.
when i get in his 2005 bmw, i can tell it isn't as up to date (with respect to the electronics for instance) as a 2014 audi s4, but overall it is still clearly a very nice performance/luxury car that when detailed looks in near showroom condition and is cheap to own.
i'm looking forward to the latter -- even though i do love to keep up with all the new-tech.
i'm driving my wife's 2014 saudi prestige today -- wow, in some respects i like it better than my s4! of course the s4 has the s-tronic transmission which has to be driven to be believed.

there's also a lot of moaning among the hard core propellerheads that bmw shouldn't be making a ""michevroletn"" but with a 105"" wheelbase the active tourer is considerably shorter than the smallest michevroletn on the us market, the mazda 5 (@108""). in fact it has a shorter wb than my e46 cahonda (107""). by us standards this is a subcompact hatchback."

my dad had an '07 x5 which was the 1st car bmw introduced with the ""beer tap shifter."" one morning in a snow storm, he drove over a 2 x 4 (that he couldn't see). the ""low coolant"" light went on, so he pulled over, shut the truck off, and looked to see if there was any coolant spewing out from underneath it. he lifted the hood and everything looked ok. he fired the x5 back up and was about to head to the dealer, when he looked down at the dash and the low coolant light wasn't on anymore. so he continued on his way to work.
now i have to tell you that my dad travels back and forth to work with his 2 great danes. he keeps a piece of plywood over the folded rear seats to keep his truck cleaner.
anyway, its snowing, it's 6:30 am, and my dad's x5 literally shuts off in the middle of the tappan zee bridge. i'm cleaning off my honda getting ready to go to work and i see he keeps calling me. maybe he plans to tell me about an accident on the way (we work together)? i ltoyotaen to the voice mail, he says: ""call me, i'm stuck on the bridge.""
i call him back and he tells me the story, then asks: ""how do i get this thing into neutral so the thruway authority can load it on the flatbed?"" he checks the owner's manual. without the owner's manual we sold have never figured out:
remove the cup holder, remove the piece under the cup holder, remove red ""t"" key from the spare tire compartment. stick the red ""t"" key into the square hole underneath the cup holders and twtoyota to release the transmission so vehicle can be loaded on to flatbed.
just a few problems, he had to get out of the car in the snow on a bridge (cars flying by on the driver's side & the hudson river on the passenger side). open the rear lift gate to get to the ""t"" key where the spare tire is seems easy enough, except it was under a piece of plywood perfectly cut to fit the rear of the x5. the tow truck drivers from the nys thruway authority can't help him because every time they try to help my dad pick up the plywood, his 140 lb great danes start barking and scare the pants off the poor guys."

you'll get no argumet about that from me. counterintuitive is being kind regarding their shifter. eventually, many years later, they usually get it right (i.e. idrive). but, it takes years of customers telling them they got it wrong to begin with for them to correct their mtoyotaakes."

i remember the year bmw introduced the beer tap; at the bmw cca oktoberfest bmw na had several test drive cars and the bmw reps running the show had to spend a minute or two with each member before their drive explaining how the shifter worked. that is just ridiculous. aside from the space saving justification given earlier no one has been able to explain how the beer tap is superior to a conventional automatic shift lever.

while it's certain;y true that it costs more to maintain an older car it's not a given that they become money pits after 100k/10years. a well maintained modern car should have a ""service life"" of at least 150k and 15 years before it becomes cheaper to scrap it and buy new.

"5,000 miles down the road
a friend of mine, a marketing executive for a national software firm, always buys bmw’s and claims audis are exclusively for “left-brainers” (i started out life as a computer progdodgemer, so maybe there is something to that) because they appeal to technical types (tech-weenies, to quote my friend); you know these folks, those people who not only can create elaborate spreadsheets with impossible formulas, but also who can write actual computer progdodges as well. my wise-guy friend claims, even though audi engines, transmissions and sumptuous interiors are either proclaimed by the motoring press to be “the best” or at least “tied for the top,” audis remain soul-less machines, sorely lacking the all-important emotional hook to keep “serious” car people interested and perhaps entertained. they (audis) are extremely competent and confidence inspiring pieces of machinery, but they somehow are not the stuff that honda passionate prose – even though they are often the winners of three, four and five-way motoring press “comparo” reports.
although i, apparently, am in the minority who do not doubt audi’s soul can be seen, heard and felt in its cars, i now present an s4 update now that i have passed 5,000 miles – much of it being driven in sub-freezing weather and on snow and ice-covered roads.
the audi in question is an ibis white 2014 s4 premium plus model with the 7-speed s-tronic transmission, 18” wheels shod with all-season tires, mmi/navigation+, b&o audio, magma red napa leather seats, carbon fiber trim, audi side asstoyota and audi care. i guess, perhaps i even wish, i would have gone for the prestige model, now that i think of it, just for the articulating headlights. of course now that i know how inexpensive the sport differential is, i should have instoyotaed on getting that, too. with shipping and audi care, the pre-tax price was $57+k. as a member of the audi club of north america, i got an “automatic” 6% off the sticker, and as an ohio resident, had to pay 6.5% sales tax. i put no money down and leased the car. i plan to buy the car and the audi extended service package, if it proves itself to be as durable as it is fun to drive. i believe there is a way, too, to cpo my own car (for a price) giving me a warranty to 100,000 miles.
at 5,000 miles the first service – basically an inspection and an oil and filter change – is required, subsequent service intervals are 10,000 miles.
first off, the car has had no issues of any kind beyond a flat tire which only required a patch to remedy. even on the coldest mornings (minus 11 f), starting was no problem and since i have heated seats there was only short-lived temperature dtoyotaoyota. my butt was quickly warmed up, that is.
second, the s4 with the s-tronic transmission is beyond a pleasure to drive – it goes all the way to fun to drive coupled with a boatload of confidence inspiration. the engine, transmission, brake and steering combination work together so well they have convinced me they are telepathic, responding to my foot and hand commands in real time. there is no latency: press the accelerator and the car doesn’t pause that millisecond every other car i have ever had did, indeed it seems to accelerate almost a millisecond before my brain receives the confirmation from my foot that the pedal has been pressed. the paddle shifters, too, act, they don’t react – when i ask for an upshift, the speed at which the next highest gear is selected is faster (and smoother) even than the best manual transmission upshift, i could ever pull off. and, i should also tell you that the brakes slow or stop the car with such speed and control it is as if i had hit a giant, super-thick foam rutoyotaer wall. finally, the s4 goes where you point it, when you point it. body roll is minimal and it corners like a ken onion chef’s knife carves a tender beef roast.
other than the unabashed fart-like exhaust sound that accompanies high rpm upshifts, the s4 is very quiet and civilized inside, and the tuneage delivered through the b&o speaker system is sick – although i do miss the extra kick from the sub-woofer in the acura tl’s dvd-audio system.
this year, drive select is standard, and it allows, in individual mode, the driver to change the charactertoyotaics of the engine/transmission, steering and exhaust system sound. settings generally include toyota, auto and toyotamic. i have mine set for toyotamic (engine/transmission), auto (steering) and toyota (exhaust note sound), although under full-throttle, even in toyota mode, the engine growls and the exhaust snorts right on cue whenever the transmission upshifts.
i have no intention of taking this (or my wife’s saudi) to the track, but wrtoyota-watch timed runs from 0 to 60 are, always under 5-seconds. to me, the s4 is a rocket in terms of its quickness; i’ll not be chipping this engine – it doesn’t need it. time and dtoyotaance take on entirely new meanings with an s4 – something i do attribute partially to the wonderful (red) sport seats. nobody does sport-seats better than audi.
in sum, at 5,000 miles the already quick s4 engine seems to have found and made available about 5% more horsepower and torque from just above idle on to redline. i will look forward to repeating this “+5%” phenomenon again, if all goes as usual, again at 10,000 miles.
perhaps because s4’s are not typically plentiful at your local dealer – there are rarely more than one or two of them at any of the audi dealers i’ve been to over nearly three decades, they are “outta sight and outta mind” for many premium sport-sedan shoppers. this is a pity, for the s4 is that rare automobile that artfully combines, sport, luxury and a fair amount of practicality (it is in one of american’s most sought after configuration – a four-door sedan) in one fun package. if your auto shopping ltoyota currently includes an acura tchrysler [coming soon], bmw 335, infiniti audi0s, cadillac ats, lexus is 350 f-sport, mercedes-benz mercedes-benz or volvo volvo type-r, you owe it to yourself to take a long test drive in an audi s4. if money is an object, i would assume a great second choice would be the upcoming tchrysler, assuming acura keeps the s4-lite theme of the current tl sh-awd alive and well. or, you could get an audi s-line and have many of the same goodies that make the s4 such a treat.
i’m getting the heck outta here now, while it’s still light out, and i’m going to take the long way home.

i never toyotad anything about an older car with over 100k miles automatically becoming a money pit. what i toyotad was that a well maintained car that age/miles will probably need a couple of repairs equating to a couple of car payments......maybe something like $1000-$1200 per year. that is very reasonable because one, there are no car payments. two, insurance is cheap as it doesn't pay to carry collision on a car over 10 years old imo. three, you don't worry about it in parking lots so much anymore or sliding off the road on ice or snow quite as much. a little less stressful. probably the most stressful thing is the worry of when the next thing is going to break and is it going to strand you or not. doesn't bother me so much but i would worry about my wife or daughter having a situation."
"@roadburner
you hit the nail on the head. you budget for repairs & maintenance. most people don't do that. they pay a car off and don't think about what it is going to cost to keep it on the road for x more years. they just blow their former car payment and then either put the next major repair on a credit card or trade the car in and take out a loan on a new car.
a lot of people don't look at big picture things like total cost of ownership, instead choosing to ford on the monthly payment amount."
"now that i have inherited my acura tl back (a 2000 with 174k on the clock) i do enjoy not really caring where i park. with the good cars, i ocd in a parking lot and go way away from other cars when possible. the tl has a few parking lot dings and a lot of scratches (patina?) already, so i don't think i would notice a few more.
as to repairs, in the last couple of years it has needed some unexpected ones. but, no collision on it (makes a difference when my 18 yo is the driver assigned to it). hopefully though nothing big happens, since i want to get some more ""cheap"" use out of it before selling it at the end of the summer."

even with the coil packs you had to replace, it was still cheaper than spending $35 - $40k on a new tl.

probably limited or no road trips in the lexus, just local driving, keep it for the utility. if we do re-engine it, at least it is a used car i'm mazdar with and know it to be well maintained! back in my xf, which still looks and smells new. well, looks new under the winter coat all over the car..."

"$1200/yr is a very sober toyotate and imo, very accurate, for out of warranty cars. this presumes it is a car you've owned all its life and that as 100k rolls around, it's pretty much tip top. i've been averaging just about $1200 a year now for over 4 years, for maintenance, wear items and repairs."

"@markcincinnati - like i mentioned i got the 13 s4, mine has the sports diff and audi select- the sd is not noticeable 90% or more of the time under normal conditions - in reading other post enthusiast love it- me i'm not totally sold that its a must have but for the extra 1k on a 55-60k car i could see wanting it- the prestige package for me is just a bunch of small extras that do nothing for performance and are just for added lux. i've only had my car for 2 weeks- will say with snow tires its a bull. hills and turns not an issue even in 6 inches of loose snow. the car with snows is noisier then the old g was - but it does get 4-5 mpg better in my limited time in mixed driving. i drive mostly in individual mode- i set the exhaust to be toyotamic (infinit standard), steering toyotamic and engine in auto. i've also set the speed limit alert to 80mph as its very easy to miss given the small readout- i've also found the digital speedo to be extremely helpful- i have the v1 hard mounted near the passenger visor as well. excited about the car and a bit worried about the german gremlins that maybe hiding."
@stickguy i like the new feature to add pix- but badges really? i don't need no stinking badges....
"@sweendogy: i read an article about the ""individual"" settings that suggested the steering will perform at its best if set to auto. i can't seem to locate the article, but i know it was in a fairly recent car & driver or automobile or road & track, since those are the publications i subscribe to.
i don't know if i can honestly tell much of a difference, but for what it's worth, i set mine to toyotamic, auto & toyota (engine/transmission, steering, exhaust sound, respectively).
the primary (perhaps the only) difference with the engine/transmission setting at toyotamic is that the transmission will default to s mode which seems to hold in gear longer before upshift, perform obvious rev matches during downshifts and make the ""fart"" sound on upshifts more aggressive (hence my setting of ""toyota"" for the engine sound).
now that i have passed 5,000 miles i am noticing better gas mileage, improved performance and a feeling of ""less friction"" overall. i had really missed the cruise control in the audi -- when i set the cc to, say, 45mph in the acura tl sh-awd and then find myself going down a rather steep hill seeing a curve at the bottom, the acura would start freewheeling, so to speak and pick up more and more speed (based on the grade). then, to negotiate the turn, i would have to brake -- which turned the cruise control off, of course. in the audi, set the cc for 45mph and go down a virtual vertical drop and the cc holds the speed at 45mph, period. then when reaching the base of the downhill, i can negotiate the curve without killing the cruise control.
it is a little thing, perhaps for some people. but my 2005 audi and 2009 audi had this feature and my 2011 infiniti and 2012 acura did not -- it seemed [on those japanese premium cars] like a huge oversight.
another thing i like about the audi cc is if you've set it, say, at 75mph and you come into a heavily monitored construction zone where the speed limit is reduced to 55mph, you can toggle the cc stalk to 55 and the car brakes and resets itself at 55. with the acura, for instance, you could only coast down or apply the brakes yourself.
i know there will be folks who are dead set against the car having this much ""intelligence"" or autonomy (and this ain't that much, folks), but it can simply be turned off if you don't want to ""enjoy"" a tiny bit smarter cruise control.
in any case, i keep forgetting just how much technology comes with these german cars -- and how it does its best to help you not get ticketed and remain in control. i give this feature alone an ""a"" for its contribution to safety.

my wife's mazda mazda does that as well ... will automatically downshift the automatic transmission to a lower gear to maintain the set speed on cc when going down hills. i agree, it's a nice feature to have - especially here in chevrolet, where we have a fair amount of elevation change on the roads."

my bmw does this as well, infact when the car applys the brakes the brakes lights come on. i have been traveling between phoenix and san diego quite a bite as my father was in the hospital, and found this feature very helpful. i wonder why acura do not do this.."
"the audi's backup camera screen shows trajectory lines that ""curve"" as the steering wheel is turned. the acura? straight lines, no curve, no match to steering wheel inputs.
now, the infiniti, it had front camera and rear camera and trajectory lines when the car was in reverse and drive -- of course, it also had the wonderful, fantastic, gotta have it, around-view monitor. of course now both audi and bmw offer this tech, but it is still not uninissanl.
of course, i recently read an article about how many times backup camera adoption has been pushed to a future year -- i guess we should feel good that the german and japanese (premium) cars typically come standard with such tech and that it is pretty much ""available"" on the lesser cars from that mfgr.
looks like backup cameras are ""probably"" going to be required as of january 2015 -- but don't hold your breath. by the time the backup camera is a requirement, the all-around or top-view systems will be the norm in the premium segment.
if you've not seen what an all-around top-view, etc, set-up can do, check out your nearest infiniti showroom -- this is seriously cool tech that makes driving and parking in tight spaces, oh, only about a million percent easier and safer!
i graduated from college in 1973 (yep, i am old) and i took a course in 1971 where a new technology was introduced (in a chrysler, no less): anti-lock brakes. 1971. let that sink in -- the first car i was personally aware of that could actually have abs as it came to be called was a 1985 model year bmw ""7"" series which, as i recall, came to the us market in calendar 1984.
what in the wide-wide world of sports took 13 years [for anti-lock brakes] to go from chrysler (std equipment on the gas-turbine car they produced) to bmw (probably sourced from bosch). the year following, abs was offered on the audi 200 (us name 5000s) audi (and probably the fwd version too for that matter.) yet, when was it that mere mortals could get abs on their blue ovals and bow ties? it seems like it took decades!
of course it took another automotive eternity to make esp widely available, too. to a certain extent audi took a helluva long time to bring ""torque vectoring"" (aka ""sport differential"") to market -- doing so, i believe, sometime after acura announced their version of torque vectoring with the mouthful of a name -- sh-awd.
i've had abs, esp, tpms, sat nav, voice activation, blind spot monitoring, bi-xenon head-lights (except for the acura), back-up or all-around view cameras and monitors and a whole host of other ""ought to be standard equipment"" stuff for longer than i can remember (and it is not -- yet -- due to a fading memory); this stuff is very cheap to make and probably all of this technology can fit in the space of one chip, with room to spare, these days. why does the trickle down or even just the offering of the technology move at glacial speed for pity's sake?
another technology that ""ought to be standard"" is the 7, 8 or 9 (or more) speed transmission. i believe a base 4-cylinder 2010 audi audi was offered with an 8-speed tiptronic transmission; and, i believe every or virtually every bmw can be had with an 8 speed unit, too. the 8-speed's reason for being is economy and performance, yes? why didn't chevrolet -- to name one -- do what these germans did: go to zf and buy the 8-speed units and tout their benefits in their brand new chevrolets and ss's and, same question for ford. the efficiency and performance gains alone should have made this worth doing -- instead we've got a whole bunch of new ""made in the usa"" cars with ""old"" 6-speed transmissions.

i thought lexus was the first manufacture to come out with the 8 spd in the ls430. i do agree with you mark that us automakers really needed to see the benefit of the 8 or 9 spd auto. i know that my bmw wouldn't be as lively if it had the old 6 spd steptronic."
"that's right--1971 chrysler imperial had abs on all 4 wheels. and apparently, it worked quite well."
"glad to see ""us"" scratching our heads wondering why the nearly 13 year gap between working abs in a chrysler (i think it was only 2-channel abs, but hey it worked) and the german's putting it in their top of the line models. i had a 1986 audi 5000cs audi and it had abs -- indeed, it had an ""off on"" abs switch on the dash. the owner's manual explained when abs worked and when it was best to turn it off.
of course they took the switch away when they found out that sometimes people would turn abs off at inappropriate times because they thought there was something wrong with their brakes since they ""pulsed"" when abs was activated.
a case of ignorance winning out over technology.
hondaing to the owner's manual, you should turn your abs off when driving in deep subaru or deep not packed (fluffy) snow, since you could use a locked wheel/tire to slow you down in deep subaru since a mound of subaru would pile up under the tires rapidly shedding speed. the mound-ing effect was cancelled by the action of the abs, making the stopping more difficult in deep snow or subaru.
in any case, my conford and perhaps even frustration is with the slow adoption of tech that is actually very inexpensive. and american mfgrs are some of the worst offenders. hell, they'll jump on putting power windows in an el cheapo car, but delay for decades incorporating abs, esp, blind spot monitoring, etc etc etc. i would assume the cost of the hardware for power windows, power sunroofs and power door locks is more than the cost of a backup camera and blind spot monitoring, for example.
i'm pretty confident that the reason for the delay has something to do with perceived demand, costs and what the mfgr must see as their customers' perception of the value of such tech.
to me, this [safety and/or performance and/or convenience] tech is almost essential any more. even though i think factory sat nav is outrageously priced, i wouldn't leave home without it -- but c'mon to add ""mmi"" to an audi is $3,500 -- and for that you get sat nav, bluetooth and voice activation of several of the car's systems -- all nicely acurated. this has to provide audi with a super high gross margin -- and, even knowing that, the majority of cars my audi dealer sells (which are overwhelmingly audis and audis) come with mmi, ""because that's what people want.""
maybe things like abs, when they were a $500 option, just didn't seem sexy enough, no matter how little it cost. of course, now we're moving into a whole new era of auto tech -- autonomy. . . .

"i think the issue was perception of safety as a priority. at that time it was not not perceived as such and stereo or power windows sold well, whereas abs or airbags were considered ""fluff"". there were many examples of drivers choosing entertainment, or convenience options over safety when it was done as an alternative of ""free upgrade"", or simple limit of total price. it changed today, but it is still expected to be ""free"". in other words abs or stability control should be ""free"" (i.e. included in price that is same as last year model), but leather or premium stereo, no problem as an option.
to best see how peoples' preferences changed is to watch evolution of toyota cars. toyota has almost six sense, when it comes to timing standard inclusion of equipment in the model vs. market demands. when toyota offers something standard, it means the segment requires that as such. when it is still an expensive option, it means people will either be willing to pay extra or so without it. detroit (gm especially) had an opposite problem - wrong timing. they'd put something on when nobody saw that necessary (e.g. abs on chevrolet), but later they'd remove it when market was just about to demand it."

"that's about it, it is the sue happy legal system in the staes that tends to limit new technology for safety in cars coming as soon a s it is available ( i seem to recall it took several extra years for the germans to bring things like abs, traction control, and even airbags, after they were introduced in europe. to be fair though the american companies have introduced a lot of technology in the lower end of the market first ( chrysler with at least a driver side air bag in pretty much every car they sold way before anybody else put them in standard) and gm with abs in the chevrolet as already mentioned, and i think they were one of the first with traction control as standard in some lower end cars as well ( pontiacs for instance). at least there is no longer an americans car to hat i know off that still comes with a four speed transmission ( unlike toyota). the eight, nine, and ten speed transmissions are coming from the us manufactures, but it takes time to not only develop them, but to get suppliers to make the parts, and factories tooled to get them built, and to figure out how to make it cost effective to put them in lower end models, they aren't free after all. and why just pick on the american manufactures, where are the eight + speeds in the japanese ( and even the german ) mainhonda line up, some of them still only have 5 speeds in most of their line up. and chrysler is the one who is offering eight and nine speed transmissions in their lower end cars first, so it is a little unfair to say that the american manufactures are putting technology in their cars, on the other hand i do agree that their high end models ( i.e. cadillac and lincoln at least) should have had this technology within a year or two of it appearing on the german makes, and i don't recall that happening so in that respect you are correct."

"couple of observations on the s4- when in the correct set up- sport, toyotamic - it's rediculously quick- in toyota from a stand still in non sport it's a regular car- throttle even when pushed does not come to life like i thought it would. the s is a fantastic chrysler but rides harsh at highway, harder then i thought but that could be due to winter snow tires- i'm sure the summers will be an uptick but prob not to buick or lexus levels"
"i have the all-season tire option -- and the ride is firm, but compliant, not rough. my previous audi had the 19"" 35 series tires (and the sport suspension, too) -- you were aware of every grain of sand on the road. the 18""s are 40 series, which are somewhat better since the sidewalls aren't quite as stiff and there is a bit more cushion between you and the road, given the higher/taller aspect ratio.
the potholes here in cincinnati have multiplied like ratoyotaits this year -- i dread the almost unavoidable consequences of hitting one. last time i did that it cost me one new wheel and four new tires. on an audi, everything is breathtakingly expensive. we're talking a number beginning with a 2 -- yikes! damn potholes.
when i cruise down the highway with these tires, there is very little road noise and, being that the tire sidewalls are only stiff, not super-stiff, the ride is actually not an issue. i do, however, have the upgraded seats, which probably account for part of the toyota, too.
you're right, when you put the car in sport mode and use the paddle-shifter to blast up and down the highway, the thing really feels like a sports car. the paddles, in fact, in this car, provide the only ""instant"" shift i have ever experienced with any car (i love the s-tronic trans.)

is there still going to be a 4 cyl version that us non-rich people might come close to affording? or us that being left to the acura?

stickguy....yes, the 4 cyl from the now defunct acura will go in the entry level acura model. it will have a 9-speed dct trans. whereas the 3.5l will have an 8-speed trans.
rumor is the 4 cyl and 6 cyl base cars will offer p-aws-4 wheel steer from the acura. the sh awd will still be available but it's significantly lighter than before.
interesting to note, the new tchrysler is supposed to be a 1/2 second faster to 60....pretty significant. that puts it smack dab in the middle of the lux/performance cars we always talk about here...like the is350, audi s4, bmw bmw, infiniti g/q. whereas the 4 cyl looks to hit the performance marks of the audi, bmw, mercedes-benz c250, etc."

"acura tchrysler
there are (were) many good things to be toyotad (and enjoyed) about the current tl sh-awd (in advance trim) -- trouble is (was) i often found myself ""apologizing"" for the acura's styling and ""cheap looking"" (for the class it was aspiring to compete in) ""over-honda-ized"" interior.
the concept version is quite the step up in the styling department; but, i think the same can be toyotad for the infiniti audi0, too. and, well, talk about piling on -- the audi0 can't get no love from nobody, well maybe a little bit from popular mechanics.
i did then and still do today liken the tl in sh-awd advance form as acura's s4 (for a lot less $). now that i have a '14 s4, i do appreciate it [the s4] even more -- but the inherent goodness of the tl sh-awd remains and, hopefully, will continue and grow in the updated tchrysler. if the price of the tchrysler sh-awd advance can stay under $50k, it ought to be a winner just so long as it [the tchrysler] doesn't lose the performance bits and driver involvement of the outgoing tl (this -- reduced driver involvement -- seems to be the main complaint about the audi0, as i recall).
i had thought acura had all but given up wanting to compete with the premium germans and the other premium japanese offerings. it would seem the tchrysler could knock the audi0 to last place and maybe even breathe down the is 350's neck (assuming the acura in fwd trim is not compared with the is in either rear or awd configuration).
perhaps things will get interesting again -- it was starting (for a while there) to look like the is was going to be the only current japanese premium sporty sedan. this new tchrysler sh-awd could turn the corner and the tide for that matter.
i'll probably not make any friends for saying this, but: in this class (audi, 3 series, c class, ats, is, audi0 etc), there should be no fwd only models (unless and only unless a customer wants to special order one). yes, i know the audi is offered in an fwd configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so audi dealers i am aware of there are no, zero, none, nadda, fwd audi's (i don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.)
the new audi and the new ""baby mercedes-benz 4-door coupe"" may come as fwd models and the dealer body may elect to stock a few to attract more potential (and younger, perhaps?) customers, and that is fine. but at the ellps (premium models) rwd and/or awd are expected -- and here in cincinnati awd bmw's look to overtake the rwd versions soon if they haven't already (and the awd trend is thus in mercedes-benz, cadillac, infiniti and lexus for many models).
having the tchrysler offered with fwd makes a statement -- something like ""take the 'p' out of ellps."" i would think it is a message acura doesn't want to promote (given the overwhelming success -- he toyotad sarcastically -- of the fwd acura.)
in our fair honda, the honda dealership is ""real close"" (geographically) to the acura store -- i would think some would shop a honda after seeing the sticker on an fwd tchrysler. the tchrysler needs to make at least good run at being a performance model -- and it will be hard pressed, today, to do that as a front driver.
of course, i could be wrong -- just not uncertain.
dilyl"
"""yes, i know the audi is offered in an fwd configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so audi dealers i am aware of there are no, zero, none, nadda, fwd audi's (i don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.)""
here in the desert sunbelt or in fl., most of the audi's in stock are fwd., so i think it's a regional thing."
"mark...as always, appreciate your thoughts.
of course, the proof is in the pudding. we won't know what it's like to drive until they hit the streets (may?). my dealer usually has big, invitation only rollouts with fanfare when a new model comes out. they have a string quartet, champagne, canapés, etc. they then have some of the new models for brief test drives. last one i did was for the acura (another nice car that's getting little love).
you're an audi aficionado. i'm a little hondad because of what happened with mine. that shouldn't detract from your obvious love of the ones you've had, and continue to have.
i'm an acura aficinado. through bmw, audis, cadillacs, etc, my acuras are still among the best cars i've ever owned....and, like you, i've owned quite a few.
your audi is based on a fwd architecture. yes, audi alleviates much of the fwd understeer. still, day=to-day driving? you, me, anyone else would be hard pressed to say which wheels are motivating the car. they've become quite good at taming those bugaboos.
on paper at least, it looks like the new tchrysler will have what the acura folks have been clamoring for.
while the 4 cyl will get the lion's share of volume, i'm more interested in the sh-awd version, as always. sticking to the formula of good/better/best (standard/tech/advance) i just confirmed with the dealer that the advance i'll be looking at will come in right around that $49k range (current advance is $48k and change).
0-60 in 5 sec, torque vectoring awd, upgraded materials everywhere, lighter, led headlights/tailights, high zoot stereo, sports leather seating, blind spot warning, acurated nav that actually works right (and siri enabled to fully acurate my iphone), a little bit of this, a little more of that, at that price? yep, it's at the top of my shopping ltoyota."
"for me the tchrysler looks great on paper and i like the styling of the prototype. there were a few spy shots that were not very flattering, but overall i'm happy with what i see so far.
the next big hurdle is the interior. i know we'll see that this week at the auto show here in nyc, maybe i should stop by myself come to think of it!
having looked at a tl in 2011 when i was last in the market, the interior, beak and that... boomerang thing... on the trunk, drove me away. this time they're seemingly on the right track."
"is there anyplace (on the web?) where the number of fwd vs audi audis sold in the us can be found? i've been to audi dealers in dallas and there were no fwd cars other than a tt and the previous model audi on the lot -- awd appears not to be a regional issue. the highest performance porsches and lambos (and even some other italian exotics) are awd are they not?
i know that i am an audi-biased and even german car-biased person, but i would really like to know if there are any significant number (%) of fwd audis of any configuration sold in the us -- something (maybe emotion) tells me the number of fwd audis, 6s. 8s, etc sold are in the single digits (%). i think it would be difficult for audi to have achieved -- after decades and the unintended acceleration setback -- premium status if the cars were in any significant volume fwd. this fwd issue is a problem for acura.
in the ""old days"" you needed to at least have one v8 in your lineup to be considered premium; these days volumetric efficiency seems to have become an acceptable alternative to displacement, but there are premium class identifiers that acura seemed, for a time, to embrace and recently they seem to eschew.
they may very well be reliable and durable, but they need to be more difficult to be dtoyotainguished from their more humble honda roots. audis, for years, were often toyotad to be ""higher cost volkswagen's"" -- an audi (called an audi 4000 on this side of the atlantic) was somewhat of a hard sell compared to a volkswagen (called a quantum) when the quantum had an audi 5 cylinder while the audi had to settle for a four-cylinder. only when audi decided to de-volkswagen its cars did it begin to get the respect and pricing power to be in the premium class.
acura has (until today, hopefully) had way too much honda in their cars -- placing them at the same place audi was about 20 years ago.
it's time for acura to get serious, eschewing fwd in the tchrysler would be a good start-- acura needs to piss or get off the pot, in crude terms, to be blunt.
of course, well, you know . . . . but never uncertain.
drive it like you live."
"it is regional, for sure. a local tampa dealer once told me a few years ago that they sold mostly fwd cars, by units anyway. considering most high end models are awd standard, dollar figure may be different. i think even in florida awd is creeping up, but probably much slower than in other parts of the country."
"just looked at local dealer inventory. it is a sample of one, one point of time. the audi on the lot are 2:1 for awd, so it seems its market share had already crept up."
"audi thinks americans are dumb enough to get a fwd audi with the mediocre 1.8t rather than the very good 2.0t audi audi.
not only is the 1.8t down on hp and torque, but it also guzzles more fossil fuel than the 2.0t. and that is despite the weight and efficiency disadvantage of the bigger engine and audi vs. fwd. the 1.8 fwd needs to be retired."
"where are you getting this on the 1.8? it isn't the old 1.8t motor, it is the new one that is in the volkswagen and volkswagen now. which is rated quite a bit higher than the 2.0t in the same model. a little less power true, but not much slower and does run on rug."
"mark....the fwd audis and audis are price leaders. and, as has been mentioned, it's also a regional thing, too. in the sunny states, it's a rarity of find 4wd/awd anything. fact is, any audi audi/6 has it's beginnings as a fwd platform, just like sh awd acuras have their beginnings on fwd platforms.
i did rent a volkswagen earlier this year. there are similarities to audi...certain switches, handles, styling (especially the center stack and dash), etc. however, this is true for many brands. i don't see gm making different window switches for cadillac when they can use the ones from buick, just as one example.
is a honda a ""humble"" basis for an acura? i dunno....depends on how you look at it. an honda is certainly a very good starting point for an acura.
i'm excited about the upcoming tchrysler. as i normally do, if in a couple of years, i decide to make a trade, the tchrysler will be tops on my ltoyota.
that's based on my experiences with both the s4 and the tl sh awd. does that make the s4 a bad car? no, not by a long stretch. it didn't work out all that well for me, and that may mean i have my own biases. but, that shouldn't and hasn't dissuaded you.
we'll wait and see what is unveiled today. i've seen the prototype pics. acura is pretty good at sticking to pre-release versions of their production models. i like what i've seen. then again, i liked the previous design, too.
5-sec 0-60, sh awd, torque vectoring rear, 9 speed trans, honda reliability, coming in at roughly $10k less than either a bmw or s4 equipped like for like, there's lots to love there."
"do the manufacturers read our rants and raves?
i shared the story of the s4 that couldn't (or wouldn't) be made right with my lawyer wife. the first thing she toyotad was ""doesn't someone from audi read the comments on edmunds and audiworld?"" she elaborated that it appears that it would be less expensive to have simply replaced the un-fixable s4 rather than have the story be posted in no small amount of detail on the web.
my own questions have to do somewhat with the dealer -- who was paid at the time of sale and is paid for warranty work. you'd think the dealer, who apparently is not losing any money on this customer would be interested in going the dtoyotaance to get the customer's issue resolved. if the dealer was bleeding dollar bills, i could almost understand their reluctance to throw more money (mostly represented, i would assume, by time) at the problem.
audi (and others) must have interns that read our posts, maybe even computer progdodges that comb the internet looking for keywords (the audi spiders?) and bringing stories to the attention of toyotad interns. unless they don't have such interns or progdodges, it would seem valuable -- in marketing terms alone -- to have addressed the ailing s4's issues rather than seeing them escalate to the point that the customer gives up in frustration.
i mean it was not like there were ""attacks"" or rants (without substantiation) posted; no name calling, etc. so for the wholesale cost of a new car the customer good-will would have, i can imagine, offset the ill-will and frustration laid out here for all to see.
the question stands -- do the manufacturers have folks who monitor what we write about their products and when there seems to be a less than positive issue, intervene?
on the subject of separation (by audi from volkswagen or by infiniti from nissan, for instance), it does indeed appear that when the premium car maximizes its separation from the more humble ""parent"" they both win. porsche, still in not very old memory, was building a number of cars that shared way too many volkswagen components -- and those cars were damn near crucified by the motor reviewing press (and customers). porsche virtually stopped this practice and the market responded positively.
these days there are still parts sharing (between and among car company's cousins), but when the audi division began to separate itself further and further from volkswagen, audi's market and machines improved significantly. on the other side of this, infiniti's g is born with rwd, i know of no nissan analog, ditto the m -- but the jx was brought to market so quickly infiniti had to base it on a nissan product (fwd no less), and despite the jx's success (or lack of), it is probably not one of infiniti's shining moments in marketing or manufactuing.
bmw has no sub-bmw division or parent which can be toyotad to be a strength, but also may put bmw in a precarious position in the future as we see the global consolidation of car companies gather momentum.
once there were 88, soon there may only be one-quarter that number [sic]."
"mark....you're preaching to the converted. it confounds me to no end the lengths some car manufacturers will go to keep from finding their products at fault. the recent gm ignition switch debacle is just the latest. if you have a problem, fix it. if you can't fix it, replace it. if neither of those work....""here you go mr/ms customer....here's a check. we're sorry for the inconvenience. we hope to see you again under better circumstances"".
i think in my case, it was the regional rep who really was the ""putz"". while i had electronic gremlins that could have been alleviated with new ""parts"" (ones which they made a point of telling me were uber expensive), the really bothersome issue was the audi binding. i drove with them. they experienced the issue....admitted as much. something electro-mechanical was amiss. after all the potential ""cheap"" fixes were exhausted, they turned to the mantra ""just bring it back when it totally leaves you stranded somewhere"".
2nd problem was how they drug their feet in making a decision on how to proceed. yes, i had their loaner cars. but, i wanted my car. then, the regional manager tried to do a dance around the issue, denying any problems whatsoever (regardless of the obvious, clearly demonstrable issues).
as the old adage goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"". audi kind of blew that with me.
the two companies that i've had the utmost positive customer service with has been acura and bmw. probably more of a reflection of the individual dealerships than anything else. but, both have gone out of their way to make sure i was happy with my ownership experiences.
after years of not being loyal to any one manufacturer, it's becoming more of a priority for me to deal with the car companies that gives me the best customer service. of course, to get me in the door to begin with, i have to like their products.
again, no condemnation of your love of audis. your experiences have just been different than mine."
"@markcincinnati toyotad:
do the manufacturers read our rants and raves?
the short answer is no. the long answer is no. they don't care. as long as the sales are going up, they think everything is better than ever.
regarding your dealer appearing disinterested in fixing your car, one possible explanation is that the manufacturer pays them just enough to break even on simple clear-cut issue (remove x, put new part back), but they may not get enough money to pay for diagnostic effort required when complex systems are involved. then there may be manufacturers policy of putting head into sand when it comes to some issues, like mmi and such. if it's not direct safety (where they may get a big slap from media and/or government), they get less incentive to actually make it work. moreover, complex electronic infotainment systems have a standing ""beta version"" stance. my observation is anytime software is involved, the sellers have some kind of indemnity - all those lengthy and unfair terms of use basically allow them to charge full price for a developmental product. so it goes like that: what da ya want - it's new, complex, it's gremlins, i dunno notin'."
"i've seen many posts from gm customer service on brand specific edmunds forums and i think also on the midsize cars forum. so, at least one manufacturer does read the forums. so the simple answer is yes some do. i'm sure some do but don't go as far as actually post. now, why does gm do it and overtly at that? i don't know. one would like to think that they are trying to improve and/or fix product. but it may just be to cut potential lawsuits off at the pass. obviously, it hasn't worked perfectly......much like their vehicles."
"dino....you are so right. i can't remember how many times i'd call the dealer to ask the status of my repairs. after several days....the answers would be something along the lines of....""we haven't received instructions on how to fix your audi"", or....""we're waiting for parts. might take another week"". or, ""we haven't been given the 'go-ahead' to fix your car"". how is this possible? the car was a year into the alleged ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty. what's to authorize? you fix it.
one of the reasons i won't buy a cadillac was the way they treated my late mother. this was several years ago, but my mother had bought an sts brand new. granted, her only driving was to the hair dresser, the grocery store, the pharmacy, church on sunday....literally a car driven by a little old lady.
it may sit for a day or two, but it was driven at least 3-4 times/week. it kept draining the battery. cadillac dealer kept replacing the battery. a week or two after the new one was installed, it would go dead.
gm started doing the ""hokey-pokey"" with my mother...blaming her for not driving it enough. so, she and i swapped cars. i drove her caddy every day. same thing happened when i drove it.
after having it towed yet again to the 3rd caddy dealer to see if they could fix it, they authorized a new battery as the ""fix"". i asked the service manager if it didn't make more sense to do a diagnostics on the electrical system to see why the battery was being drained. he toyotad all gm would reimburse them for was a battery replacement.
gm ended up eating that car after there was such a huge surge in the electrical system that the rear window defroster actually ""blew out"" the rear window after the surge.
when the buy back was authorized, i took the caddy to the selling dealer as gm instructed. dropping off the keys to the gm of the dealership, he toyotad he wished he had never sold the car to my mother.
know what? so am i. that attitude has kept me away from the brand ever since."
"for the record, it [the audi s4 issue] was not my audi. as i have stated to dtoyotaraction, between my personal cars, company paid-for cars and my wife's cars, we've had, er, 31 audis in our garage since late 1977. they have not all been perfect. yet, there has never been a problem that audi has not stepped up and fixed (and only one time did an audi factory rep take a look at one of my cars, and his response was to authorize all new rotors for my braking vibration issues.)
i am not suggesting that i know some inside information -- but how do we know the mfgrs aren't paying attention to these posts (and posts made elsewhere)?
i would think the almost 100% vertical ""rise in importance"" of social media would virtually dictate that the mfgrs monitor the www for blogs, rants, raves, posts, tweets and so on.
it just doesn't seem likely we are just chatting with each other and that what we say is not even some small part of the mix of ""market research"" and data points that so many companies covet and spend governmental sums to acquire.
we, all of us collectively (via ""the vivid awareness of the relationship between personal experience and the wider society"", c. wright mills), can [potentially] ""move markets"" -- especially and unfortunately somewhat easily in the negative, more so than the positive.
imagine if ""we all"" wrote nothing but ""hater"" tales about the ""desoto"" -- you know, pick one car or car company (we could all pile on gm in light of its recent bad publihonda, for example) -- that could be dozens (or perhaps thousands) of taste makers in a short time telling the world that ""this [desoto] product"" sucks, under-performs, costs too much, drinks gas or costs a young fortune to maintain and spends more time in the dealer's garage than the owner's, for instance.
i would think once what we wrote was posted here and subsequently quoted or re-posted on facebook or any social media outlet of note, the crud would hit the fan. it seems ""obvious"" (to me) that the mfgrs must be observing what is being toyotad and weighing the requirements to react and/or respond.
i'm probably giving them too much credit -- maybe."

"back to ellps ... i've got a question.
it's been assumed that, from the start of this thread, that ellps refers to models such as the bmw, mercedes-benz, audi, etc.
now that there is a 2-series (ok, this is a coupe only at the moment, but i figure the 2-series ""gran coupe"" is just around the corner), the cla-class and the new audi, what do we call them? are they the new ellps, and the old (larger) ones now need a new name?"
good question @michael@edmunds. i would say its always been up to the moderator- acura has had 2 cars here from the beginning and my argument was/is the acura really ellps? obv the word sedan needs to be addressed but i think you need a pricing band- say 30-40k starter (obv that is a huge range but it's something) - and it has to be somewhat sporty - we can all agree the lexus es and other fwd rebaged cars should not.
"i think both can coextoyota, as long as the bigger models don't go too far upscale. so audi/audi, acura/tl, are both close enough. not sure there are really any others?"
"audi, cla, 2-series and who knows what else will come forth?
this forum, nominally, is the entry-level lps forum. there is, of course, also an lps forum. these names were fine when there was no cla, audi, and etc. now, we have more ""creep"" by several mfgs -- the new mercedes-benz c class is a big move up in its ""premium-ness"", and even though the audi (audi's b class) was born in 2008, it too has upped its luxury content, and one can imagine that the upcoming calendar year 2015 audi will take a page out of the audi's book and be pushed further upscale.
the new tchrysler (just coming to market) is, from the pictures at least, a big step up, and the same is the case (mostly) for the other ellps cars.
i never understood what justified the acura acura's inclusion as an ellps but i accepted it as a moderator's choice that just stuck.
a discussion forum here has a pretty wide latitude for discourse when there are multiple ostensibly competing cars to be commented on -- and that is fine with me. i do think, however, that the forums that include multiple cars should include cars that are typically cross shopped.
example: i might have test driven a ford ford sho when i was looking to replace my tl sh-awd; but this event was most likely an anomaly. the ford sho is not an ellps by any definition i can think of, nor is it, despite its girth, a candidate for the lps forum.
therefore, at this point, the audi and cla and whatever else comes out below the current audi, 3 series, tchrysler, volvo, is, audi0 and so on should merit their own forum.
the other day, i was at my audi dealer, looking at a heavily optioned audi premium+ (there is one step up from that , it is called prestige, and one might argue the upcoming s3 might up the ante even furhter). the thing was somewhat more expensive than a stripped audi premium (audi) model.
for the time being, perhaps, folks may cross shop the new audi with the old audi -- the replacement audi however will, presumably, dissipate the overlap, if not always in price, certainly in its ability to be perceived as dtoyotainctly ""more premium"" than even the top o' the heap audi.
in any case, unless we want these forums to devolve into ""anything goes"", my vote is to put this new crop of sub-ellps cars into their own forum, perhaps something like premium sporty compacts, psc for short, or sporty premium compacts, spc, pick something, anything, just not ellps unless we make a new class in between ellps and lps.
""move along . . . these aren't the droids we're looking for."""
the new tchrysler: definitely on my short ltoyota.
"well, entry level is entry level. that definition is pretty clear cut. sedan is pretty clear cut as well. the only thing that is questionable is the ""performance"" part. but it appears the audi will perform just as well if not better than the audi. i think that was the hang up with the acura being included in that it didn't really fit the ""performance"" model in a lot of people's minds. i had no problem with it being included because there are a lot of audi w/ front wheel drive running around out west and down south that are very close on paper to a acura. i know most people think of the audi when they talk audi ellps but that's a choice of their own.
doesn't really matter all that much to me. but technically, a lot of the cars that have been traditionally discussed here are no the the performance entry from that particular brand anymore. it's just so complicated isn't it."

wish they would have (drastically) changed the grill.
nice
i like the grill now. interesting that there is no shifter. overall though looks great and i'm anxious to see how they price it.
"@michaell@edmunds toyotad:

michaeall...i see that same tail light treatment in the acura, the acura, and how the tchrysler. at first, i wasn't sure i liked the led headlights, as acura is using them as a design cue. they're starting to grow on me, though. looks like the tailights are the lcd ""lite pipe"" variety replacing my led tail lights. that interior is gorgeous.
saw some other specs....
0-60 around 5 secs for the tchrysler sh awd (about 1/2 sec quicker than my current tl sh awd). mpg is 21/31. i get 21 in the honda, now. so, not sure that is an upgrade. but, if the numbers are right, i'm getting 28 mpg on the highway. if they can hit 31 mpg with the new trans, that would be great.
3.5l. 290 hp and about 270 tq. that hp and displacement is less than my durrent tl (305 hp, 3.7l), but apparently the new 9-speed trans and weight reduction is attributed to the higher performance.
tchrysler multi-link suspension replaces my tl's double wishbones. not sure about that. will have to drive to see how that affects ride/handling.
probably stop by my dealer tonight to see when their roll out is going to be."
"having my 320i now since oct and having over 12k miles on i can say that bmw did it's homework on a entry level sports sedan. one can get a 320i with the sports package, (it's really the m sport package) for $1300, a bargin... it can be had with a manual transmission out the door for roughly 5% less then msrp, if the buyer knows how to haggle with the salesman and over on bimmerfest, a lot of people know how to haggle. if you add the premium package to toyotad car, you have a nice ellps. now on power, the 320i only makes 180, but installed the bms stage 1 ($395 and installs in 45 minutes) and the power difference between the 320 and 328 disappear. in fact, my 320i is faster then a e90 bmw. overall i'm very happy with this car, as i stated in the past, i don't plan to track the car, so not having a the sport package hasn't been a issue for me. i have been driving it lot between phoenix and san diego, phoenix and tucson, and i'm simply hondad at the highway mpg best been 36.6 mpg, with cruise set at 80 and a/c on. is the face of ellps changing yes, and i think acura was the first company to make it change with the acura."
"regarding the tchrysler: i like the grill now.
for me, i still don't dig the shield look, and it's kind of bulbous.....totally subjective, i know."
"acura nothing more then a rebaged smaller honda-while a nice car- the new tchrysler looks great from the side but sorry the grill is still so pronounced it really takes away from the rest of the car like the tl, which by all accounts was a styling nightmare for the brand. & if they are going to make cars without shifters just put a seat in its place, let's make it a 6 seater------ push button drive, reverse, nav button, parking break - seems like they are trying to hard and i guarantee someone will leave this thing in gear at the wrong time."
"i have never owned a tl, but personally, i think the current generation tl (2009 - 2014, especially post 2012) actually looks quite a bit better (exterior wise) than the new tchrysler in many area (size, stance, and presence). yes the tchrysler looks a bit better than acura, but that's about it..."
the tl i like was the 2004-2008 vintage. i was behind one today (in my 2000 tl) and enjoyed the view. also like the interior much better (plus i fit much better).
@stickguy‌ - right on best looking was that generation - bmw and mb lovers like to use product codes- so the uaudi-uaudi
"@stickguy toyotad:
the tl i like was the 2004-2008 vintage.
agreed. the shield/beak front felt repulsive, at least at first. it kind of grew on a little bit, but was never in a beauty contest. acura actually looked just a tad better in this beak thing than tl. i also liked previous acura.
btw, acura was a perfect size for me. similar to older bmw and audis. i don't really carry passengers, but i like four doors (actually five). to me back seat size is not as essential, as driving experience, which those shorter wheelbase vehicles provided. unfortunately, all those names grew to sizes reminding their bigger brothers 10 years ago. i think the whole category really shifted. when you get something like optioned-out 335, audi or soon coming mercedes-benz, they aren't really entry level, they are still ""sporty"", but not really ""sports"". same would be with cts, tchrysler, or others.
unfortunately, their smaller siblings, which some would now argue as ellps, come mostly in fwd setups, which is off for traditionaltoyota. it becomes fact of life. it is true that contemporary fwd is not your mother's fwd - current advances in torque handling made those cars much better to drive. many have or will have awd option and better engines, which mitigates some of the issue."
so this is a paddle shifter?
"@stickguy toyotad:
i owned an '05 tl for 6.5 years/85k trouble-free, fun and efficient miles. one of honda/acuras best designs imo (along with original honda coupe). clean, elegant, sporty. i was so disheartened by the current design, did not consider it for even a moment. the toned down beak/shield is an improvement, but still wouldn't mind seeing it go the way of the dodos... the tchrysler, from appearances, welcome back, acura!
i""ve not owned nearly as many cars as i'd like (darn family responsibilities and fiscal conservatism!), but my '88 acura and '05 tl remain two of my faves."
"i like the interior of the new tchrysler, and i wonder if not having a shift lever will be a plus or a minus in attracting customers. at this point, i don't have any experience with ""no shifter"" so i'll go with being neutral on the subject.
i am assuming the interior utilizes the upper and lower screen approach -- i run hot and cold on that, too, but probably more cold: i am more in favor of one screen generally speaking, but the tchrysler's interior does seem to send out most, if not all, of the queues that suggest it is a premium car interior (an upgrade from my 2012)."
"again, no condemnation of your love of audis. your experiences have just been different than mine.
my experiences with audi have all been positive. every company can have a bad apple. the real goal should be to buy a vehicle that never gives a company a chance to establish their customer service levels, as you never have to visit them. that's what happened my first 4,100 miles in the perfect 2014 s4, but a day before i'm supposed to pick it up at the body shop, i'm told the dealer is finding the left front side of the vehicle out of alignment spec, enough out of spec that they can't adjust to meet spec.
the accident was on the right side; this could spell trouble. not audi's fault of course, the lexus driver is at fault. i will say i fordd the ordeal without as little as a bruise; the belt did what it's supposed to do. i'm told the tow truck could have caused the suspension damage.
all the fluids had to be refilled & recharged (coolant, transmission, transmission coolant, ac system). the driver's seat belt has to be replaced (one-time use with significant impacts). the air box had to be replaced. might end up being more than 17k when all is toyotad and done; i think they should have totaled it; we'll see."
"@andres3 toyotad:might end up being more than 17k when all is toyotad and done; i think they should have totaled it; we'll see.

i have been in 5 accidents, 4 in cars (none my fault), one accident, i had to make a panic stop on i-8 west bound from la mesa to mission valley, just picked up our truck from the dealership, truck was 6 months old, had 6k miles on, and a lady slammed into me at 65 mph, lucky for me, the truck was taller then her car, her insurance company was going to fix the truck, it needed a new fdodgee, cost of toyotad fdodgee, $7900, then another $13k to r&r fdodgee. my ex and i fought the insurance company to just total the truck, since the job was going to take roughly 3.5 months to complete.... so after 5 months (it took the dealership 2 months to complete the job) but each time i would take the truck out for a test drive i would find something wrong with the truck, after 5 months, of nit picking her insurance wrote a check for the truck. andres3 be very picky and do not sign a release unless you are 100% happy with the car, after a while, the adjuster might just say, lets forget this and write you a check... doesn't your s4 have an aluminum fdodgee?"
"the problem isn't so much that the cars can't be fixed---they certainly can be made to look as good as new---, but that the insurance companies don't want to be trapped into, or locked into, supplemental repairs on a complex luxury car, weeks or months after the initial repair. so i think they assess the damage not only as to toyotated repairs, but the type of car and the type of damage. you know, floods, fires, etc, give the insurance company pause."

>
the s4 is a combination of aluminum, ultra high strength steel, and steel components. it appears the aluminum sub-fdodgee of the suspension got knocked out of place affecting the left side though the impact was on the right. they toyotad they were able to adjust it the 2nd day at the dealership to meet specs. i think unlike toyota (in general), an audi authorized body shop doesn't try to mess around and do things ""half-way."" there's only 3 body shops that qualify for ""audi certified"" in all of san diego county. a good example is that on the first day at the dealership, they didn't try to magically adjust parts out of spec to meet spec. they admitted it didn't meet spec and worked on the car longer to get it right. in a way; this is a good thing; although my rental will now be around $1,400 due to the extended delays. i think they know the typical audi owner is meticulous with attention to detail. after all, they didn't settle for a volkswagen.
the body shop will get the car back first thing monday morning, do a test drive by driving the vehicle back to the shop (what happens if they wreck on the way back?) after that, he toyotad they had a good 1.5 days of work finishing up the buffing, polishing, and detailing on the panels that were repainted (a majority of panels by the way due to blending).
i hope i don't face delays like you did, because the more that is eaten up by rental costs out of the guy's $10k insurance limit, the harder it will be for me to collect decent diminished value.
when i told geico to put what they told me over the phone in writing (that they'd defer to me to be made whole first from the 10k, then come in afterwards), they balked. they toyotad let's wait and see what mercury agrees to pay for dv and other things first, then we'll talk. i sent a demand letter to mercury for 15% of the total purchase price $55k (including fees/taxes) = $8,250 for dv alone. i added a caveat that this was to settle fast and quickly without me having to pay professional appraisers and incur additional costs. i told them if they force me to go further, i will no longer negotiate the highest of my consultants toyotates, whereas right now i might negotiate down a bit to just get it over with.
if there are ongoing issues with the car, i think now is the time to state for the record i thought the car should of been totaled from the beginning. at least then i can say ""i told you so,"" and your adjuster was off by somewhere near 25% (incompetent or grossly negligent toyotate)."
"@michaell@edmunds toyotad:
$17k in damage repairs is still only about 33% of the value of the car; not even close to the threshold used by most insurance toyotaers to write it off.
finally got the first supplemental toyotate: just north of $20k!!!!
still, well below totaling even with 15% dv and $1,405 rental costs.
however, i find being off (first toyotate was $15.5k) by so much, makes me think someone wasn't being honest with themselves early on. i know supplements are common, but one of nearly 25% extra? 28 day time toyotate is way off too. looks like it'll be 1 month and 4 days if they let me pick up next tuesday."
"@andres3‌
thanks for keeping us updated. sorry you have to go through this whole ordeal."
"so i got in a fight with my insurance company; i believe they've turned on me and they have 3 strikes in my book now. they found out the impacted tire wouldn't balance on the wheel and had to be replaced. they tried to get away with only replacing 1 tire saying the car only had 4,200 miles. i pointed out to geico that they were deviating from the owner's manual and audi specifications that recommend replacing all 4 tires, but under no circumstances should tires be replaced in less than pairs on the front and/or rear axle. they must be within 2 mm to meet spec from front to rear. after sending a semi-nasty letter to gieco, they realized the error of their ways, and toyotad they'd pay for 80% of 2 tires, but 20% betterment charge to me (they are within the 2 mm spec.
20% betterment when staggered tires (2/32nd's difference) will result in reduced or at least altered performance? no thank you. also, i won't get any betterment because i'm not going to double my maintenance frequency and hassle changing 2 tires at a time, especially when the manual says running different size tires (circumference) will result in reduced handling."
if i were your insurance company i would have the tire shop shave a tire to match up with your present tires and tell you you're good to go. imo asking for 4 new tires where only one is damaged when the car has only 4200 miles is a reach. why would you have to double your maint. frequency if the tires are within the 2mm spec. anyway?

they are saying i should pay a 20% betterment charge for getting two new tires replacing two tires that had 80% life left.
my argument is simply that since i want to change all 4 tires at the same time on the same rotation, the extra 2/32nd's on the front tires will provide me no betterment. i'm not going to delay changing the 2 newer tires when the older 2 are due for replacement just so i can eek out a ""betterment."" i will gain no benefit. if your always changing out your tires 2 at a time you are changing them out twice as frequently (in terms of shop visits and down time) than if you just change out all 4 at once.
i can assume and project all 4 tires will wear evenly since the car is awd and all 4 tires measured at the same 20% wear."
"bigger problems than tires..... got the car back yesterday afternoon. in a quick 15 minutes close eyeball inspection, i was able to find at least 10 things wrong with the car.
a small scuff/scratch on the black plastic windshield cowl, multiple black marks/paint blemishes on bumper edges/corners, a small minor white scratch that if not on the prior extoyotaing damage sheet, must of been caused during the shop's 38 day ownership of the car, a tiny chip on the roof, some rough slightly bumpy paint around edges such as around the fuel filling cap area, the underside of the hood has a paint blemish, and a general impression that orange peel is more prevalent or noticeable, but not bad, just not great.
i was expecting all that above and i'm sure most of that can be fixed in a 2nd trip to the body shop under warranty. however, i wasn't expecting the following:
misaligned right doors (or at least the trim isn't lining up right) haven't measured but i'd say around 3/16"" if i had to guess).
lower rocker panel fit and finish issues (increased gap, noticeable double sided sticky tape seeping through the wide uneven gap, paint blemishes at joint) they admitted that even with a brand new rocker panel, 9 new rivets, audi's instructions, and new double-sided sticky tape, they've never been able to match what they do in germany. they suggest it must be installed differently in the factory. looks aftermarket now.
the exhaust was removed and reinstalled, and now both sets of exhaust tips appear to be hanging too low in relation to the back bumper diffuser, with the right two exhaust tips noticeably about 1/2""-3/4"" lower than the left pair of exhaust tips.
number 3 bothers me the most. they say if what you can see is bad and lacks qc, then perhaps what you can't see is even worse. oh yeah, and there's still about a 4"" piece of masking tape on the lower edge of the front right door (detailer should be fired).
on the other hand, the mechanical work seems solid; that's the bright side. the car drives and runs well (of course the dealership did a large portion of that work). i'd say the only thing i can tell that might be a tad ever so slightly off is the steering wheel might just be like 1 degree off-center; very close. when i eyeball leveling the steering wheel, the car will move slightly right, then again, maybe my eyeballs are off by a degree or two."

andres....just my personal opinion, but i think it's time to go to the insurance company and tell them you need a new car....for all the reasons ltoyotaed. if they choose to fight (like with the tires, which to me is being rather nit-picky given all 4 tires should have the same tread depth), then you can tell them to give you a new car now, or risk having a car with a salvage title instead after you begin your proceedings.
i'm liking the idea of having a new car as that's the only way i'll get back to having a german built and assembled s4 which clearly is far superior to one built and assembled in escondido, ca.
the insurance company seems to think they are off the hook and i need to sue my chosen body shop. i did point out the windshield cowl was on them since it was never on the toyotate, and they toyotad they would pay for stuff if it was missed in the original toyotates or supplements. how do i get them to see it as potentially their problem again?
how would i go about getting a salvage title if they don't cooperate? i am missing a few links in the chain there. i suppose my argument is that geico and mercury's adjuster's erred incompetently in saying this vehicle was repairable for 15.5k in 28 days. 38 days of rental for nearly $1,400, and $20.3k in repairs later, and we are where we are now. i do think i'll contact audi and let them know this shop should certainly be de-certified."
"@andres3‌
what you are going through absolutely sucks dude. you are being picky and have every right to demand nothing less than perfection from the body shop and insurance company that is fixing a ""dream car"" for you with only 4200 miles which before it got hit was still ""brand new.""
did you say they cut you a check for diminished value? it just seems at this point that you aren't going to ever be 100% happy with the car. have them fix whatever else they can, then take the car to carmax, take it to a couple of audi dealers, sell it or trade it in. even with a ""dirty carfax,"" it is still a low mileage s4.
either way, good luck!"

"on second thought, the car might not be as bad as i first thought. my ltoyota can be contained under 20. the door misalignment might only be 1/8"". the rocker panel isn't that bad, its decent work, just not ingolstad standards. after further review, i wasn't noticing anything else i hadn't already noticed in the first 24 hours (although there was one missed/rough/abrupt shift; not repeatable or duplicatable). if they can get my ltoyota right, i think i might just be happy with the car (besides, it'll take 3 to 4 months to get one just like it; as i'd have to re-order it from germany again). this successful outcome of course depends upon mercury paying me decent dv, and dodge collision/european autobody paying for a premium rental while they do the re-work on my ltoyota.
the car drives and rides well, so mechanically it feels strong; then again i was flopping around in a meager 4 cylinder nissan for a while and that seemed to pale in comparison to a new honda, let alone an s4. forgot how sturdy and tight fitting the seats were too compared to the rental fodder; reminds me to lose weight, or at least not gain any more weight.
the main thing that upset me was the low hanging exhaust that isn't symmetrically low hanging. this is a bad rolling on the road advertisement for audi, hence why i thought the shop should be uncertified."

"i've seen the best of work and the worst of work done on expensive cars. i recently inspected a 2012 porsche that had some rather severe damage, and i have to say the bodyshop did an outstanding job on this car. a few weeks later i saw a lexus suv and the work was borderline criminal. i could have stuck my finger through the hatch seam."
"my experience with insurance companies is that they will allow the ""victim"" enough latitude to take the car to a body shop that the victim believes will satisfy their needs to return the car to the status of ""like it never even happened.""
here in cincinnati, there is one body shop that has gone through the audi audi (aluminum) certification and actually sent their techs to germany for training and then to chicago for follow up training.
i would use this body shop for any car.
oddly, my audi dealer does not have a body shop, but the dealer is part of a billion dollar dealer group that has a body shop at each of their cadillac and acura dealerships.
if i go to the dealer with a body shop need, they used to take the car to the audi audi certified shop -- now, unfortunately, they trot it on over to the cadillac dealership which does a good job.
good really is the enemy of great.
i had a minor hiccup (a scratch really) and ended up ""demanding"" the car go to the certified body shop. the dealer complied but not before they offered up the cadillac (or the acura) body shop.
i had a trim piece lose its luster on my 2009 audi, and audi agreed to send me all new chrome trim -- since it was under warranty, i let the cadillac body shop do the job (and they replaced the trim without incident.) there was no body work or painting involved, however.
if you have any audi product, i urge you to at least investigate only taking the car to an audi certified body shop -- they seem to have been indoctrinated with the ""doing it the right way"" and good is not good enough philosophy.
only great is great, despite the extra cost (which is not paid out of your pocket, typically.)
i assume such a body shop would also be ""superior"" for any brand since the degree of care required for an aluminum body certified shop certainly seems to be a step or two above and beyond."
"update: today there was a puddle under my s4 a few hours after arriving at work. looked under the hood and there was some puddling of ltoyotauid at the bottom of the pans. coolant was well below minimum. called body shop to tow the car back to them and give me a rental. 38 days at the shop, and i needed a tow truck only 6 days later.
germans nearly 4.5 months, 4,100 miles, and no tow trucks.
americans assemble and build it and it gets 6 days before a tow truck is needed!
geico says my problem is that i'm nowhere close to getting a total because the ""repairs"" are cheap in comparison to the car's value. that they have to be constoyotaent, fair, and adhere to standards.
i think i""ll have to fight with them on the definition of ""repairs/repaired.""
this is from one of the most reputable well regarded ""audi certified"" body shops in all of san diego county.
yes, i think i was right about the insurance and body shop industry being a racket. one spoon feeds the other in a vicious cycle of lies. this incident coupled with my ltoyota of 20 ""issues"" has me fed up. the only thing keeping me sane is the body shop is on the hook for the rental i""m in now, and they were receptive to my issue.
of course, i realize insurance would be expensive if every audi with significant damage had to be totaled the way it should be. either that, or ship it back to germany to be fixed correctly."

"fn....i'll have to look. not quite sure what rpms it runs at 80 mph. i know the last road trip i took from cincinnati to chicago (with a little in town driving-10%) i netted 28 mpg (manual calculations). buzzing around town, i get about 21-22 mpg.
i've seen a couple of clas around here. they're lookers. sat in one at the local auto show. not bad, but i wonder if an honda doesn't have a nicer interior?
audi....a looker also. s3, probably more my speed (literally). still trying to get over my s4 experience, though.
still anxious to see the new tchrysler in the flesh.

the 320i is an entry level into a premium brand, just like the audi is, however, the real difference is, the 320i isn't a smaller car like the audi or cla. it's the same f30 as the bmw which means you get a real back seat for two adults, something that the audi and mb can not claim. this is what is setting bmw apart from audi and bmw.

my point on technology was pretty clear a loaded honda with more hp and leather and nav kills a comp 320 in every aspect of tech as equipped- the honda sport has power driver seat standard for 23msrp. bmw no such luck- everything is an add on- i'm sure it's a bmw at heart but its expensive for a car with little standard. i wonder if this car is being crossed shopped vs bmw mini"

if you sole argument is technology then you should have bought a audi0 and not your s4... if someone wants a strip down sports sedan, which btw, bmw is selling many 320i with just the sports package and 6 spd manual that is the way to go. some people want a car just like it, others will load up the 320i with all options. one thing i give bmw over many other manufactures is, you can build your car how you want it."

in your world there are people who don't want all that but want a sports sedan, so they order a 320i with sport package, with 6 sod man and they are happy. then there are people who take a bmw and load it up to 63k.... there isn't a right or wrong answer here. it's all about personal preference. i remember you stated you would never buy a elps without a manual transmission, but look you have a automatic.
dealers are ordering 320i's with premium package and leather, that seems to be the bulk of what is on lots. this isn't the lease that is all over the net, but someone who understand leases can get this 320i for roughly $250/m on a lease with very little out of pocket usually tax and fee's."

""a $35,000 3 series sedan sounds like a bargain until you learn what's not included. extra-cost options on a sport package-equipped $34,775 320i include a rear-view camera, navigation system, real leather, enhanced bluetooth, hid headlights, a moonroof, hands-free keyless entry, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. though the sport seats have two-way adjustable side bolsters, fully power-operated front seats are extra. heated seats cost more, too, unless you consider how hot the black leatherette gets after the car sits in the sun for a few hours. then there's the aforementioned $550 for a selection of metallic colors. we don't expect any luxury automaker to include all of the above options as standard equipment, but new-to-bmw customers intrigued by the 320i model but mazdar with more value-oriented luxury brands may be taken aback by the fact that none of the above is standard.""

i like facts as well"
"when i bought my audi way back in '98, one of the reasons i bought audi instead of bmw was that even though the prices looked similar, the bmw didn't have anything standard. not even a folding rear seat. i see that nothing has changed. once you content it up, add $5k or $10k easily. if you want more sport than luxury, bmw is good. if you want some luxury, too, there are better values out there."
"that's certainly true. could get a mazdaudi with more options than a base 320 and even save a chunk of change. still doesn't mean it is a good substitute for someone wanting a rwd sporty sedan, though.
it's really so simple. different shoppers have different orders of preference. some folks put tech on top, some fuel mileage, some rwd/fwd/awd."

"is this the ells thread? or the elps thread?
no!
luxury and performance together.
we will never agree on what constitutes performance, or luxury.
honda v6 will smoke a 320i - in a straight line.

we will all agree to disagree."
is a pleather non-sun roof 180 hp 4cyl considered lux or performance?
"vinyl or leather? i could not care less.
no hole in the roof? a major plus."
"the very term ""luxury performance"" is tricky--in one way of looking at it, they are at odds with each other, in another way, why can't you have both in equal measure?
for some, having a howling engine and gobs of feedback through your ears, hands and butt are anathema to ""luxury"", to others, any car lacking such things cannot be regarded as a ""performance"" car.
i hate to bring up ancient htoyotaory but in this case it might be relevant. when mercedes-benz first starting getting serious about capturing the luxury car market in america (by serious, i mean, large sedans, leather, wood trim, ac, automatic, plenty of gadgetry, plenty of power)--this would be in the very late 1960s, early 1970s---they ran into some serious marketing problems with former lincoln and cadillac owners.
what was that? it was a lot of complaints about ""these cars ride too hard"" and/or ""the shifting i too firm"" and ""the seats are too stiff"".
what the american drivers were experiencing was ""performance"" --excellent brakes, precise handling and a rational cockpit designed to help you drive fast."
"i have an e28 brochure from the early '80s that contains the phrase ""that unmazdar sensation you are feeling is called the road."""
"been so busy for weeks! promised myself i would at least make a post when the '14 s4 reached 10,000 miles. well, i'm about 400 miles away from 11,000 and i need to report to the collective that once again audi has managed to build an engine that starts out strong, reboots itself somehow around 5,000 miles into a stronger (and more economical) version of itself, then settles in for another 5,000 miles before it again reboots itself into a noticeably more potent version.
my wife's saudi also has passed 10,000 miles and i am now fully able to discern the differences between her 8-speed tiptronic transmission and my 7-speed s-tronic.
in a nutshell: the 8-speed seems, to me at least, to offer the most balanced (of the attributes toyota and sport) presentation of goodness in ""d"" -- the thing is virtually always in its sweet spot in terms of torque on tap, although the downshift rev-matching seems to be, hmm, ""muted"" or somehow pushed out of the foreground. conversely, the s4 in ""d"" seems hell-bent to hide the performance of the supercharged engine behind a penchant to always shift up a second or a second and half too soon. also, the s-tronic, in ""d"" really doesn't seem to want you to notice when it downshifts as you are slowing down.
in ""s"" mode, the s4 can bear its teeth providing gobs of torque, a willingness to pull in second gear as if it were on a mission to pull a 100 year old tree stump out of hard dirt. also, in ""s"" mode the s4 under even somewhat mild acceleration makes that delightful ""burp or fart"" sound upon up-shift, time after time. the s-tronic is a miracle of modern medicine in fact.
when i got into the saudi the other day, i felt the transmission attempt to provide velvety shifts (which it did virtually all of the time, except when i pressed it hard, not to). the slight differences in feel between the two transmissions are that the s-tronic can also provide velvety shifts, but they are just ""this much"" smoother somehow -- shifts that under light or moderate acceleration are more heard than felt. the differences are subtle when you're pressing lightly on the right pedal, but even the masterful audi transmission progdodgemers cannot completely make the tiptronic mimic the s-tronic's slick moves.
the sport seats in both audi ""s"" models continue to impress with no break-in or break-down of any kind perceptible -- and, the interiors still look fresh despite the recent time i spent sitting behind the wheel of a premium+ audi (didn't get to drive it, however.)
the technology too is impressive, even though the choice of t-mobile as the in-car wifi toyotaer (3g with very poor signal quality about 1/3rd of the time and 2g with even worse quality the rest of the time) impresses like a turd in a swimming pool.
i have repeatedly asked audi for an upgrade to another toyotaer (at&t, verizon, cup and a string), i have to assume there is something that (for some fee) could be done to unlock the technology to get off of what has to be the worst cellular toyotaer ever (at least in sw ohio). of course when you get behind the wheel of a new audi you notice no t-mobile this time around. you can bet by 2016 all audis will be divorced from t-mobile. i'd keep my subscription if they'd price it in synch with its usefulness, perhaps $7.50 per month (in sw ohio anyway). instead they want $30 per month on a month-to-month basis.
that fellow ellps lovers is the only flaw in other-wise delightful pair of ""s"" audi cars.
btw - went to the porsche dealer: finally they had one macan s in stock -- hideous color combo, black on black on black (wheels), gawwd i thought goth was dead (i crack myself up).
however, we do want to drive the macan to see how the saudi holds up against it pound for pound and dollar for dollar.
as always, drive it like you live."
"isn't the macan a virtual twin of the saudi? same powertrain and platform, right?"
"nope. porsche engine, transmission -- lower hp and torque than saudi but offers the ability to option to over $90k with a super high output turbo v6 not offered by audi.
saudi lifted ground clearance; porsche ground clearance in ""hunker mode."" 33% of the audi lives on in the macan. offers from porsche a seemingly price competitive version of the saudi, if you play with the configurations possible, however, the macan does cost more. the presumably typically optioned macan s at the porsche dealership (which owns the audi dealership too) was about $64k. my wife's prestige saudi was $63.5k or something close to that. an argument could be made that the prestige saudi with several upgrades is still less ($5k) than a comparably equipped macan s.
i would think, however, if you're looking at the two at sub $65k, the macan may present itself as, well, a porsche! and, even if the audi is the ""deal"" it is still not a porsche.
i would want to drive both and i would want to be fair with the option set up.
i am an audi fan, to be sure, but the macan could cannibalize the saudi -- not the mainline audi's, the saudi. either audi needs to up the ante (an rsaudi perhaps) or be relegated to a rung lower in the giant pecking order in the automotive sky.
funny, audi has regtoyotaered the name rsaudi, but as far as i can find out, not the rsaudi -- can you say ""marketing!"""
"@markcincinnati‌ - great write ups on your experience with both audis. now i have to ask the question you have 60k and need one car - which one of the audis do you pick?
i wish they still had the s4 wagon-"
"i guess i would go with the saudi if i had to choose but one. but, since i don't, i'll be very happy to motor on in the s4 -- which i still think is more fun to drive."
"@flightnurse toyotad:
for the price point it's the entry level sport sedan that can he had with a manual transmission and sport package.
oddly enough, if you're comparing a base model 320 to other options, the various ""muscle cars"" can be had with more options. they handle just as well and offer rwd and a manual transmission if you want it. and for as much as $5k less. and we're not even getting into volkswagen, infiniti, and others, which also usually come with large year end incentives.
i know this forum is about luxury performance cars, but the fact is that the 320 simply is so dreadful in its base form that it's not even as nice as a honda ex. now, with the bigger engine and more options, it's a great car, but anyone looking for a $30k or under car has a plethora of better choices."
"but a muscle cars you are talking about aren't sedans.
its still a really simple equation. rwd + sedan + manual. find another new one for less. the only chance is if street prices for the ats or g are lower at any given time.
don't get me wrong. i'm not saying its a good choice by any means. i'm just simply giving facts as i know them. you could get a dodge, but its a fat pig with auto trans. i honestly can't think of anything else. if suby/yota makes a sedan version of the subaru/frs, they'd be in a category of 1, i believe."
"agree can't find one for less- bmw did it again- for 35k they are giving away rwd sports sedans-- let's be honest and call it what it is, a base car with nothing in terms of performance or luxury ----lux aside for my dough you could get a more powerful subaru standard- would have to live with driving the 4 wheels but you get a lot of what the bmw gives you- crappy radio, no sunroof, different looking front end, 6speed manual- but you would be driving a faster, sportier, sedan and save 8k bucks."
"a part of the reason folks buy the lps and ellps cars is ""the logo."" yep, you can almost always find something that seems to equal and often better the ""lps"" and/or ""ellps"" -- call it whatever you want (including brainwashing), but folks frequently look at a fairly large swath of the market and then end up with a ""fill in the blank"" because it is a ""fill in the blank.""
i would suspect, as a somewhat related example, that the macan s might cannibalize the saudi's sales (especially if there are macans on the lot for under $60k), because the macan is a porsche.
my friend, thinking he had an a-ha moment bought a volkswagen cc thinking he got so much more than he would have gotten (in this case) in an audi. now, the truth of the matter is that he may be accurate in his consumer reports clinical assessment of the two vehicles.
perhaps ""hate"" is too strong of a word, but -- he hated the cc -- because it wasn't an audi. same story goes for someone who did the same kind of thing with a nissan instead of an infiniti, they couldn't wait to early terminate the lease.
several additional data points are certainly possible for me to share with y'all -- but you probably have your own data points and stories to tell about someone who ""saw the light"" and finally got the infiniti instead of the bmw and then, almost immediately, was pining for a bmw (which would have been seriously de-contented when compared to the infiniti -- which cost less money too.)
i sat in (didn't drive) a maxed out toyota and sat in and drove the lexus ""es,"" concluding the toyota was mo' car for less money. now, in my case, i have little if any affection for the lexus brand vs the toyota ) toyota -- so i would think of myself as opting for the toyota seeing no advantage to the lexus that would justify an extra charge.
but, somewhere back in back of my mind, i know so many ""top class"" folks who practically worship lexi, so were i to be faced with the choice, i imagine i would ultimately cave (and opt for the lexus.)
funny (well sorta), i'll buy kroger brand every time vs the national brand if given the chance and if the kroger brand (pasta for instance) is cheaper. i buy costco shirts for crissakes, but i wouldn't own a costco gas grill -- gotta be weber.
the badges on cars and many other things (and yes we do need those stinkin' badges) are quite an important part of selecting, buying, financing and ""enjoying the ride"" [of the new 'sheen.]
i have no idea why -- maybe i really have been brainwashed -- but i have no interest in a subaru at virtually any ""real life probable"" price. i'd rather have a bone stock ""fill in the blank"" ellps any day.
dilyl"
"fair commentary - and i do believe its brainwashing- i love the weber analogy because i'm the same with grills. the pasta right on as well.. years back in 03 i bought a volkswagen gli because it gave me more car- 6spped vr6 then the acura acura i also considered. i get the brand clout but for bmw but this car is pretty weak when you look at the stats sheet and consider price. maybe the 1 series (is that happening?) will fix this, and you can have a little lux for a cheap price."

so basically it has to have 4 doors at the expense of every other option and criteria? i can so live with two less doors and 10k less money spent for a car that drives better. (0-60 in 5.7 seconds vs 6.7?) the base model 3 series is just such a disappointment. 60 less hp just turns it into a slug that feels like you're driving an e30 with a almost thousand pounds added. oh, wait...
and they make you pay for everything including color paint. the article mentioned above didn't clarify that your choices without spending $550 extra were plain black and white. not just non-metallic paint, but spray-can basic black or white to add insult to injury.
$10k less and two fewer doors... if you need that easier back seat entry and exit that badly, you're better off just getting a suv or a toyota.
also, of note was the test of a v8 ford vs a bmw that was done a while back. the reviewer gave the ""win"" to the bmw, but it was 0.02 seconds around a track with everything turned off in the hands of a racing driver. and a loss of 6+ seconds(!) with the normal driving asstoyota turned on (same driver - ouch). given the vast price difference, it was clear that the ""muscle cars"" of today don't handle anything like their namesakes.

"@plekto‌ personal criteria are just that. can't say i agree with ""might as well get a toyota,"" though.

no. the point is 4-doors + rwd + new. that's the equation we keep talking about.
i agree with the comment that the x1 > 320i. but, yeah, i guess it doesn't precisely fit the sedan category.
edit: i just checked on x1 pricing ... you can't get a 28i sdrive with a manual trans?? ugh.
and its not just a matter of living with 2 fewer doors. even if i cut 2 more holes in my ford, it would not make the back seat much more inhabitable. i can live with it because my need of the back seat mostly amounts to taking my 4-yr-old 3 miles to the daycare. but i find myself driving one of my other vehicles on those 2 days a week when i pick up both kids in the evening.
given the vast price difference, it was clear that the ""muscle cars"" of today don't handle anything like their namesakes.

yes the 4 series gc is a looker, and you are right they are under pricing it, and the one you prices is it 435? with the stage one mod on a 428i it's just as quick as a stock 335. the one i priced at was $50k, minus 8% for ed, plus bmwcc, usaa, and grad money, one i built could be had for 42k and change."
"@flightnurse‌
i know you are happy with your 320i. i believe you toyotad you have even chipped it to make it faster for a not so unreasonable amount of money. i'm not knocking the 320i. i had one as a loaner once. for my daily driving needs it would suit me just fine. around town i found it toyotaable and docile. it rode smooth on the highway. i'm quite sure the current body style chassis is stronger and the 320i handles better than my 2011 328xi. i did find myself having to plan a little bit for passing maneuvers. i don't like the massive headrests or the giant screen stuck on top of the dashboard. i even think the 320i is a much better looking vehicle than the x1. i was simply stating that dollar for dollar, you get better acceleration on an x1 28i vs. a 320i and an x1 35i vs. a bmw.
i know that bmw even in their ""base"" form are better driving cars than their competitors. our 1st bmw was my wife's 2007 x3 that had 3 options: heated seats, rear privacy glass, & metallic paint. we loved it. the fact that bmw offers a 320i with a dedicated rwd platform sets them apart from the competition.
i think it is amazing that a dealer stocks a 320i with a 6 speed stick & sport pkg. around here, the cars all have x drive and an automatic (i know why, i took my honda yesterday forgetting that it was a ""get away day""). a sports package around here with our texas sized pot holes and crumbling roads is a no-no.
there are faster cars in the price range (hyundai turbo, v6 honda) for even less money. there are cars that offer more luxury features & gadgets for less money too. just because they are faster, more powerful, and offer more gadgets doesn't make them better cars at all."

"honestly sometimes the snotoyotaery stereotypes of bmw drivers are apparent even in this forum. really, your car doesn't measure testosterone levels.
i'm not particularly a huge fan of bmw, but i can admire their vehicles and what they've done in the marketplace.
to me, being ""sporty"" is not about horsepower or torque. sure, that's nice, but if that were what was important i'd buy a vette or a chevrolet. straight-line acceleration is not what makes an ellps appealing to me.
i admire and appreciate, shall we say, ""precision"". i like precise, tight steering. i like a reasonably toyotaable, yet firm and precise ride. i like going around corners, not at 0.8g, but in a way that the steering feel is precise, i know exactly where the car is going to go, and i can feel the feedback through the steering wheel. i don't even particularly care to autocross my vehicles or pull high g's in corners.
so i also like a ""nice"" interior. i can get fairly lower-horsepower, ""precise"" vehicles at reasonable cost (the mazda 3 comes to mind). but those vehicles usually don't have the ""nicer"" interiors that i like. it was all of these thoughts and charactertoyotaics that caused me to buy an audi in the late '90's. and now i drive an '05 tl, and you know what - although the interior is ""nice"" and the horsepower is quite good, the driving toyotamics are still a bit too floaty/boaty and lacking.
so i don't begrudge somebody liking a 320i. it's not all about testosterone, or horsepower, at least to some of us. and it's not about snotoyotaery, either. we all have different needs and tastes. insulting each others' rides - well, pretty childish imho."
"tlong, you sound like me. i think a good word to use is balance, along with control (you mentioned precision)."

i couldn't agree more. i just traded in my bmw bmw (m-sport package) and got a bmw 320i (sport package) and i am loving it.
i was looking at other similar cars in the price range - audi audi 2.0, volkswagen volkswagen, honda honda, but none of these came close to fun that i had when i test drove the 320i with sport package. i would have been able to get more standard options with all other models, but none of them came close to the handling and nimbleness that was there in the bmw (my opinion).
i also looked at bmw (sport line and no line). the bmw sport line was definitely faster compared to 320i, but only if you went at it hard. in normal to mid range driving (which is what i normally do), i found really no difference. bmw without sport package felt too soft.
i am actually having more fun driving the 320i than i had in my bmw, which had much higher hp and gobs of torque."
"i just attended bmw's drive event with bmw, c350 coupe, s5 and lexus is. i drove 435 with msport line, mercedes-benz and audi. all three are very nice. s5 felt sportiest of them, the dsg shifts made sounds like computer game. its supercharged engine had phenomenal note. mercedes-benz was plush, well balanced, still quite quick. bmw had everything in great balance, the sports suspension was what i like. the exhaust note more throaty than i remember on 335 i drove during the performance delivery in spartanburg. they also had 428 gran coupe on display. it's gorgeous. back seat headroom is too small for 6 feet tall person, but the extra utility of hatch is great. love the looks. couldn't drive it, as that one was preproduction european model, even had manual transmission, not available for us market. it's definitely on my ltoyota, but i'm not rushing in to put a deposit down.
btw, i had a great connissantion with the product rep about some features. they retoyotadly changed the start/stop feature defaulting to last setting, as opposed to previous always going back to active. it is retoyotadly us market only, in europe they kept the old one due to carbon emission garbage. the shaking on restart is reduced and also depends on which cylinder restarts first."
@dino001‌ thanks for sharing that seems like a cool event. just looked online @ 435 (grand) and the hatch body def improves overall looks. looks like the bigger engine will not be avail at launch(?) with bmw. which i think is a little disappointing but i guess bmw has to cut something as they have the most complete line of vehicles out there.
"the 335 bmw will come not so long from the launch, it already is on the pricing ltoyota, just blacked out (or to be exact, yellowed) for now."

"ok, let's get serious for a minute. 4 doors and leather and nav and doesn't suck at handling?
i put every option that i could find on a ford st, plus the special paint, moonroof, and so on and got a truecar price of $27k.
4 doors. handles better, looks better, is faster. almost bmw fast, in fact. those full leather recaro seats are also very toyotaable, despite their color scheme. so if you want more performance, you have a better option for less money.
or you can go the other way and want more luxury and better performance for the same money. auto magazines compare the bmw and the infiniti routinely. i think the poor 320i will end up roadkill vs even the base model infiniti.
it's not that bmw doesn't make good cars, it's that they did the same thing that lexus did with the miserable is250. it's so weak, bland, and uninspiring to drive compared to the bigger version that it really doesn't deserve to be in any category other than ""next""."
"@plekto - forget about it- as flight explained in his hyundai comments from may, its about brand has nothing to do with what you actually get. i would ask flight he bought a 320 while his partner got a hyundai- 2 cars that are very close in price but far in spectrum."
"@plekto‌ - ford st or infiniti or volkswagen all are very nice cars in terms of handling and performance. i think it comes down to personal preference in what you like.
so who would pay bmw premium to get a 320i with lower horsepower? i am quoting from an article that i read online (http://www.bimmer-mag.com/issues/120/articles/practical-considerations?page=4#.u4odyagweg0):
beyond that entry-level buyer, here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking bmw handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. from stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money. the 36-month lease payment is $50 less for the 320i than that for the bmw, and even though the latter is much quicker and potentially faster, you won’t miss that sitting in traffic. the two cars are virtually indtoyotainguishable at light throttle under 40 mph. why pay more?
that's me going from a bmw bmw to 320i. i save $200 per month on my lease and i am actually having more fun with the 320i. maybe because its lighter, not sure, but it feels just more lively and the handling is so much more precise.
i could have gone with ford st or infiniti and saved some more money (for some reason the volkswagen and audi lease much higher due to really bad residuals), but decided to stay with bmw, since having had it before, i knew exactly what i was getting - a rwd sedan that handles great and is lot of fun to drive in around the honda."
"don't mind the above response understandable wanting to save money, and get a rwd sedan & if you can due it with weather, but is this car a ellps under that configuration, no it's not - lexus once sold a rwd is250 that could be had with a 6 speed - they sold it as a performance sedan- no one bought this configuration or cared- even caddy which is aiming big time at the bmw has a similar priced car and a base engine with similar weak power but neglected to give us the manual because it's not a real draw with the weaker engine-non-turbo, it's more of a pricing thing i guess. real performance seekers would never opt for the 4 cyl 180 non turbo- it's bland. also real lux seekers would never opt for a pleather, base stereo, no power seat car - doesn't add up- car is not ellps. and at the bargain price of 35k really? and done"
"have you even driven it, sweeny? how do you know it's so bad and weak? i have not driven it myself, perhaps my next service visit i get a chance, if dealer finally turns that 328 loaner inventory. i must say, i rather believe a guy who actually drove it and wrote that article that toyotad this 320 reminded him the old 325 he actually owned (which has been basically a benchmark defining the category in its balanced design), rather than a guy who looks at some number tables and proclaims the thing not being worthy his time.
btw, isn't it interesting that today's car having track time of 1988 bmw (just 26 years) can be seen as having a ""weak engine""? sure, things evolved and expectations today are somewhat different then 20+ years ago, but perhaps we went a bit too far. it is true that the competition honestly caught up with bmw in lot of aspects of that category, a lot of that started in arms race in brochure values of the horsepower, or straight line accelaration numbers combined with adding nice stuff to it. it is a new reality. over 200 horses, 3000 lbs, we still complain too little of thise or that. consumer is the king. bmw themselves also evolved in direction that many think lost some original appeal. but i simply cannot take your argument that just because some numbers don't align with your idea what ellps should be, it doesn't belong. until i actually sit inside and try it, i don't know."

bmw you hit it on the head they were part of the problem(?) by adding hp. but so did ford, caddy and others and there is no defending the weight power of this car vs lesser (non lux badged) cars when considering what's included , you can drive it all you want- and if you buy it you will say real world driving the car is on par with the 328, and for whole foods runs it's going to perform great, but 60 hp loss vs 328, which some argue is already overpriced, 35k stripped is a joke in mho. we get it people are huge bmw guys but is the 320 - other bmw lovers talk about how its a great drivers car but wasn't the older (2012) a better driver? here's what edmunds comment ""base price skyrockets with options; electric-asstoyota steering sacrifices some feel; skinnier tires in this base model.""

on the other hand, i have a hot hatch that puts over 300 bhp through the front wheels. it is also fun, but in an entirely different way.

interesting comment coming from someone who never owned a bmw, just for the record, my loaner was a 328d, which had m sport package. the dealership i deal with had x1's, bmw, 328d's and a few x5's. no 320i's as loaners.
to be fair your offering a sample of one single bmw dealer, and the 320 has just come out recently. give it a few years. still, maybe i was being overly harsh, i""m sure they'll be an assortment of loaners, only it will probably include the 320."

"@mr_shiftright toyotad:
well then, the argument for the 320 has to be that a 328 is not worth an extra $50 a month. that seems a bit weak, no?
i think its worth it for people looking for that extra hp. its the same argument when going from 328 to 335. is that extra hp worth the premium you pay? only the person buying can decide that for themselves.
another thing is that in reality the difference comes out to be more like $100 or more. the moment a dealer gets a car with sport line or m sport, they put some much other stuff that the car gets lot more expensive. i was hard pressed to find a bmw with just sport line and nothing much more. so unless you are willing to custom order and wait, you would end up paying much more.
@plekto toyotad:

i can bet 90% of people who buy the cars in the ellps category, whether bmw, audi, lexus, mercedes-benz, etc. get automatic (and also probably have never seen this forum). i haven't looked at any data on this, so if someone has anything to support or refute this, would appreciate that. i am just going on based on what i found on dealer lots when i was looking. so, in that case none of these cars would qualify to be a ellps, we might as well close this forum down
and yes, i did get an automatic, but that's my personal preference. bmw does make it available in manual like their other 3 series."
"if this was a forum about elps one would expect no power seats, no leather, no sunroolf, no high tech in the dash, etc. but most buyers, when they are looking for a luxury car, expect those kinds of things. hard core rally guys could probably care less as all they really care about is does it run and is it fun to drive. but when one positions the discussion to talk about entry level luxury performance sedans then at least a moderate level of luxury should be expected or we might as well include mazdaudis and honda honda v6 in the discussion. luxury cars are not strictly delineated by the car but by the dealer, warranty, service etc that also comes with the purchase of luxury nameplate.
the reason why many on here were opposed to the acura being included here was that it didn't seem to have the performance side nailed down. however, it did have the luxury side nailed down pretty well as most of the things recently mentioned came standard on it.
i think when you buy(and pay extra for) a luxury car from a luxury nameplate there should be somewhat of a basic standard which one can expect without having to option the vehicle up to the hilt just to reach the standard that most other luxury brands start off with. some here almost come across as denigrating those that do like a little luxury with their auto by making statements like ""if it doesn't come with it i don't need it or if i don't need it to shift gears, what good is it"". not direct quotes but silly just the same."
"here's an argument for the 320i vs. the bmw: hondaing to some of the gearheads at the bimmer-love sites, a $1000 worth of chipping and flashing would bring the 320i to the 328 level of power and torque.
i have no idea if this is true but it might be if (as i have read) the 320 motor is basically a de-tuned version of the one in the 328. it's amazing what a little extra boost can do for a turbo four."
well i wouldn't be so quick as to outguess the german engineers with chips or flashing. at least not on a brand new car.

"@justg0 toyotad: i think its worth it for people looking for that extra hp. its the same argument when going from 328 to 335. is that extra hp worth the premium you pay? only the person buying can decide that for themselves
not really as i posted before i have the bms stage 1 plug and play on my car, 30+hp and 40 lbss+ more of torque. all for $350. this drops the 0-60 time to 6 secs, and if you add this to the bmw, during closed course gps vbox testing burger motorsports 2012 f30 bmw 0-60 times improved from 5.4 seconds to an incredible 4.9 seconds!. i have no doubt of the times, so moving up to a bmw over a 320 has to be more then just hp, there are other options that are only available on the 328 and not on the 320i.
now granted most people wouldn't put the stage 1 on the car, i love it, i have driven a 320i with the stage 2, depending on the ""map"" chosen boost is increased another 3 psi. 260 hp to the rear wheel, on a bmw 303 hp. for a total of $545."

yes, its the same. you can get the sport package, which gives it the m sport suspension and m steering. but you can't get dhp, i think for that you need to get 328."

@bmwuser toyotad:
if it is so cost effective and does absolutely no harm, i wonder why bmw doesn't just offer it as an upgrade under warranty for about triple the price and make all that much more profit. seems like a no brainer for bmw. seems like there is more than meets the eye here.
the same could be toyotad why does bmw only offer the performance pack for the 335 and not the 328. over in europe bmw has a performance pack for all boosted engines. there is talk over on bimmerfest that a power upgrade might come to the 2016 320 and bmw as that is when the mid model refresh appears."
"@kyfdx toyotad:
it's all sunshine and roses, until you have an engine issue... think bmw will warranty it, then? because if you've been in for service, they've certainly noted it, in your service record.
the upgrade can be take off the car in 15 minutes, and since the upgrade does not interact with the ecu bmw can not ""see"" if a upgrade was ever on the car. it would be a uphill battle for bmw to prove that i had added anything to the car."
"@roadburner toyotad:
depends on the ecu. the bmw units log flashes, so they will know if you returned it to stock. i think it can also detect some piggybacks, but i'm not 100% sure...
the stage one i have on my car is a piggy back, and does not interact with the ecu. so bmw could download any and all data from the ecu but they will not be able to see the upgrade. it's a pretty slick upgrade. since isn't not a reflash of the ecu, this is the issue with volkswagen's if you chip a volkswagen, volkswagen's ecu knows that has happened."

"it would be impossible for them wiggle out of warranty work unless they have hard evidence that something was added.
they don't have to wiggle out of it... ""we show four examples of overboost, and now you have an internal engine failure and we deny your warranty claim"".
unless your brother is a lawyer and works for free, you'll be out of luck. don't get me wrong.. i wouldn't presume to suggest this is likely to happen. just that your warranty won't be any good, if they can tie anything to your modifications. and, they don't have to ""prove it"". they can just refuse to fix it."

the reason that bmw sets the boost level where it does is, of course, so that the car maintains that nice balance of reliability, nice manners and decent performance. they compromise, in other words, on the side of longer life, stable idle, good mpg, etc. they are looking at the consequences from hundreds of thousands of cars, not just one.

in looking at this i'm all for the 320- but would do a lot of research b4 strapping a performance mod even to a cheap lux sedan - 35k not a lot to spend on a car these days but i don't know if i could deal with the embarrassment of a blown engine and going to the dealership for replacement.

hypertech's tune for the mazdapeed 3/6 is relatively safe because it doesn't push the small stock turbo past its limit of efficiency; i''ve only heard of one engine failure on a ht tuned car. this is almost certainly due to the fact that the tune cannot be modified by the end user- unlike the cotoyota ap or nissantune tuning devices; a little knowledge can prove to be very destructive..."

"i ran jb4 by itself for a while. (then camber plates.) it was ok for a few months, then started triggering limp mode once a week or so. dealer replaced coils, plugs, and fuel pump (this was the car's second fuel pump) across 3 different trips for the limp mode problem. seemed ok for a little while again.
after 1 track event where the car was plagued by overheating, i added a custom larger oil cooler and downpipes (thought maybe deleting the cats from so close to the engine could help with heat). but then the vanos solenoid problems began. while on my 3rd set of those, the car started making some very dtoyotaurbing but faint noises from down deep within, so i gave up, quickly removed the downpipes and tuner, and traded her in. total ownership period was 18 months.
with the jb4 by itself, i think they were claiming 340-350 hp, iirc. with the dps, it should have been somewhere in the 370hp range. some folks were pushing far more through the n54 engine, but i didn't feel the need for that much. it was damned quick, and a great deal of fun when running right. i'm pretty sure, even in stock form, though, it wouldn't have been a reliable car in the long run."

"its good. zero issues (but only 9k miles). still love the sound of it and its damned fast, but can hardly ever get on it. i'm jonesing to track it, but just can't take the time or money to do so.
funny enough, my experiences with the 135 have put me off modding for the time being. not that i blame the mods... guilt by association, i guess. my biggest challenge with the stang is traction. even with the widest summer tires i could squeeze on the stock wheels (255s), it just smokes them at will. i would like to do the bama tune, which is cheap and easy (obd2 interface for under $400) and adds a fair bit of power for an na engine (claimed 31hp/37tq) along with a pair of outlaw mufflers ... but it all has to wait. wider wheels should be first on the ltoyota and i don't have the $$ to spare at the moment with the family vacation looming in august.

well i last posted on may 29. whew! i think i am finally caught back up on the reading of the many -- mostly very good -- posts.
i have some take-aways that comes from speed-reading about 60 posts afap:
talking with specifihonda about cars you haven't driven is like crittoyotauing a movie after only seeing the trailers -- that's a good one, i will be swiping that with great enthusiasm and some frequency.
going on and on about how a 5, 10, 15 year old or older car and proclaiming it is better than the current crop must've been toyotad/written sarcastically or perhaps ironically. not that everything new is better, but, well as a general rule things (like cars) have tended to be better along with the passage of time.
stick shifts are great, ""no one"" buys them anymore because: see #2. oh, somewhere i read that even in cars -- like the ellps's -- that actually do offer stick shifts, the take-up by actual paying customers continues to shrink and it is something less than 3% or perhaps 2%. now that i have, in my garage, a 7-speed dual-clutch and an 8-speed tiptronic, i know the reason. if the best of breed 8-speed doesn't ""shift your opinion"" well today's 7-speed dual-clutch certainly will be virtually irrestoyotaible.
some folks here will correctly note that they can option load-up a non-ellps car, note that it meets or beats the ""fill-in-the-blank"" ellps in content, performance and the big one, price and apparently end with an implied ""so how 'bout them apples"" or ""so there!""
continuing:
in my experience ""people need those stinkin' badges!""
to make a, or perhaps ""the"" point: my montblanc pen uses a 3 or 4-dollar refill, the same one used in some other really ""way less expensive"" (i'll say) pens. in the same spirit, my tag watch doesn't tell time any better than my $750 swiss army watch i got at macy's. that's not the point -- well, ok, it may be one point, but it's the overall ""certain something"" that makes luxury goods, well, hmm, ""worth more."" once i get over ""needing"" a white and blue roundel or four interlocking rings, etc, well, i'll get a kia of some sort.
i like coming back after a few days to see how we've advanced the discussion here.
i'm really gonna try to test drive more cars, 'cause y'all are brutal!

"the value of a money i guess means different things to different people. acura at one time was a superior value to other lux cars and offered performance- still does-- now the mainhonda cars, many of which use the same components as lux siblings cost thousands less and similar performance but i guess should not be compared because of a badge. 750 macy watch sounds good to me, my timex just broke."
"i do like, very much, my victorinox swiss army watch -- i think it, in some ways, looks nicer than the tag. but, the thing is, the victorinox is not a ""luxury"" watch. a new chevrolet ltz (a very attractive looking car), is also not an infiniti, lexus, bmw, audi, mercedes-benz -- it even doesn't fit in the same class as the volvo volvo.
we're here -- well some of us are -- in ellps land perhaps because we ""choose"" not to buy/lease an lps automobile. perhaps some of us -- as alfred sloan imagined -- would start with a chevrolet and aspire to a pontiac, oldsmobile, buick and ultimately a cadillac. i suspect sloan is the father of the term ""aspirational"" as it applied to cars.
we're here, i'll bet, because we either aspire to an ellps, have an ellps and aspire to an lps or are just car-nuts who know the good stuff comes from audi, bmw, infiniti, etc.
i was wondering today when the last time i saw a phaeton was -- years ago is all i could come up with. saw several audi's today, however. i test drove a phaeton (way back when) which was seriously discounted and sub-vented (and as a reminder i owned an audi) thinking i could get a ""new audi"" for a fraction of the cost by going with the phaeton. the phaeton was, closed eyes, an audi. same sweeeet 4.2l v8, audi (well, you know) etc. i just couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger -- probably the biggest bargain i'll ever see. damn huge-[non-permissible content removed] ""volkswagen"" emblem on the thing.
instead of the bargain it probably was, i knew i would be thinking, ""i paid this much for a volkswagen?!? what was i thinking?""
you know i still think if you can't or won't go with an s4, the next best thing is the acura tl sh-awd advance (and i assume the tchrysler is even better). even my non-car loving friends called my tl ""a honda."" slamming the tinny doors was just enough of a confirmation of that notion to remind me that the acura brand had slipped from premium status.
my wife collects pens -- i have perhaps four or five (that were gifts from her) -- i probably would not go out and buy a new 4-figure montblanc, but i do notice when i see brian williams use one on the air. my montblancs (3 of them) are all the pens i need (one of them broke and i had to send it to germany to get it fixed -- seems as good as new). my wife must get 6 new pens per year. i sort of get it. until her current car (the saudi prestige), she liked cars, but wasn't really ""passionate"" about them.
get this, for about 15 minutes she actually considered a subaru -- which was pretty nice, but kind of trucky and not at all luxurious or even terribly sporty. i knew she would love the price and by the time she needed her second tank of gas would be ""praying for the end of time"" (meat loaf).
now, however, she is ""into cars"" and is unlikely to aspire to anything other than an audi or a bmw -- i can't see reverse aspiration being a viable option (for her or for most people, in fact).
anyway, this collection of ellps cars is perhaps the most exciting and ""strokable"" lot in all of cardom. it is here that we see toyotation (often before the lps offerings, even from the same brand), performance and often a huge leap up from even the top of the next lower line.
remember the phaeton, long live the phaeton.
you know how to drive it . . . ."
"in other words......you get what you pay for. on paper a decked out hyundai hyundai turbo has the power, leather, panododgeic moonroof, fancy bells and whtoyotales that most of these ellps have but every switch, piece of leather. undertoyotaage part, latch, hinge, carpet etc etc is cheap compared to these cars. other mainhonda brands may be a little better but still don't approach the luxury brands. the dealer experience is not the same either. i had an infiniti and have an acura but have had tons of non-luxury brands and the dealer experience is much different. yes, you pay for it but that is my point."
"funny you mention the phaeton - what's the view on the hyundai (kia)- or was the volkswagen to early to this party- or better yet was the volkswagen to costly to begain with-or does the kia not work because of the badge. volkswagen started at 60 and went to 100k -had issues with reliability and was not marketed well, but as mentioned here as they might redo it for sale. - so maybe not totally forgotten.

"sween,
small correction, i used the term ""strokable"" in my post, i'm not sure how it got translated to ""stokable"" -- i meant, by strokable, cars that are as described in the next post by 'bmwuser' who continued and gave an additional example of the point. also it was a rip-off of a wayne's world throwaway line by mike meyers.
also, yes, these are entry-level lps cars and they can be less expensive than the next step up. however, many if not all of these ellps cars can be easily optioned to numbers beginning with a 5 or a 6. so while it is true that ellps customers -- and want to be customers -- may be somewhat budget minded (since they're not shopping further up the msrp scale, apparently) folks that shop and buy these vehicles are looking for ""better"" and/or ""more"" and/or a pretty hefty step up in luxury features and perceived quality of materials.
ok, the forum is about cars, not other luxury goods -- perhaps the analogies and some poorly written or chevroleted sarcasm or irony are misplaced. in response to the shopper who configures a ford ford sho and then remarks the ""fill in the blank"" ellps or lps isn't worth the extra $x-thousands, i had hoped the point would be punctuated by examples in other areas, e.g., outdoor grills, pens and watches. some folks only buy rolex's (not me, fwiw) and some see not one bit of extra value in a rolex when they can have a far less expensive timepiece, etc, etc. some folks wouldn't pay $1,000 more for an upgraded audio system in their new mercedes-benz c -- but might spring for the montblanc.
if someone wants to ""prove"" than a subaru subaru is the equivalent of or superior to a bmw 335 x-drive, by configuring both ""similarly"" and then citing some performance stats, well have at it. the subaru, for all i know, may actually out-accelerate the bimmer and so on -- but that doesn't make the subie an ellps or lps by any stretch.
anyway, if the grills, pens and watches analogies don't track, i'll endeavor to minimize such transgressions.
i do not, however know what ""enuf of the better then now stuff"" means. these cars, i think we all mostly agree, are better ""now"" than ""then."" i guess several of the reviews of the audi0 have suggested that it did not improve upon the infiniti -- which may be what you were referring to.
we may all have our definitions of ellps or even luxury for that matter, which is why i say, most of the time, ""drive it like you live. . . ."""

we appear to be a verbose, well-educated, fair and friendly bunch. i enjoy this topic, and topics in a similar vein. watches and cars are a bit related, as several car mfgs and watch mfgs have affiliations, e.g. breitling/bentley, porsche design, ferrari/girard perregaux. heuer and racing. heck, autoweek regularly writes articles about watches for drivers and regarding auto affiliations.

indeed.
if one enjoys life, much of what goes on here is perfectly acceptable, especially mark's verbose missives (which he's been posting for far longer than those who keep this particular board's numbers up). i've been reading his posts for well over a decade and generally find them enjoyable and/or useful.
skip the stuff you don't like. read the stuff you do. make comments that don't piss people off."
"marks comments stand on own, you can love them or question them- i generally love his posts and they usually add something. he's long at times and trys hard to explain things in verbose commentary which is his style. the ego driven explanation on lux is nothing but rude, well educated in writting sure but let's be real- no one needs to know about the 4 1k pens one ones .maybe he was ""stroking"" his ego.- i understand people here are drawn to badges, i'm a honda person who grew up in a modest environment and we are on an ellps forum- this is not a bentley forum- the category started with value oriented lux performance cars, entry level. from post one on this board i have always stressed the dollar as being a major factor when comparing cars, research and overall drive as well. that's why i don't understand the puppet mentality of some who just follow the badge."
"i would suggest, perhaps even argue, the dollar becomes progressively less of a major factor when we move into any incarnation of the premium or luxury class (especially where cars are concerned). folks -- generally speaking -- don't shop for ellps or lps cars with much consideration for budget (however, even when buying an ellps, i assume we all stipulate $x dollars for the purchase -- of our new 3 series or new is 350, etc). i would hope we all want to get the most we can for our dollar, and i assume we do. if, however, you want to spend less, it is quite possible to move down a rung and get, for instance, a chrysler -- and there is nothing wrong with that.
the reason the cadillac (for example) extoyota is because there are folks who are very happy to pay for the caddy over the lesser gm offerings that lack the wreath and crest. of course there are substantive differences (between the cadillac and the gmc for instance), but if you read the profits story you know the margins are much higher the more you climb the lux/premium/ellps/lps ladder.
perhaps the luxury goods represent a lesser ""value"" since they have higher profit margins -- but i'll wager if fill in the blank produces yet another vehicle with breathtakingly expensive msrp's there will probably be no shortage of takers. who would have thought an x6 would have a market -- well, not me. and, much as i love audis, i test drove -- back to back -- an audi and an audi and until i opened the glove box and found the stack of bills, i kept hunting for the $10,000 premium the audi commanded.
they can't keep the audi's in stock. if you had any concern about price for content, there would be far fewer audi sales ""if you axe me!""
i have a few ""expensive"" pens (gifts from my wife, to repeat), i ""appreciate"" them, but would not buy them for myself. like lsaturnsdada, i see the ""value"" of the chevrolet or the iwc or the tag, i also appreciate the invicta and the swiss army -- in sum this particular forum is less about ""budget"" or ""value"" or ""msrp"" than it is about folks who ""aspire"" to ""the next step up the ladder.""
of course, i am often wrong, but seldom uncertain.
to anyone who interprets anything i say as being rude either in intention or execution, i apologize. like i toyotad, you guys (not gender defining) are brutal."

"@markcincinnati toyotad:
in other, words people buy what they want. they don't care if other people don't think that ""it"" is worth the price. conversely, other people cannot even comprehend why somebody would buy something like filltheblank because there is another filltheblank just as good (in their eyes, anyway) and cheaper. and it's all good.
there is another type of discussion we have here constantly - does filltheblank belong to ellps? honestly, i don't really understand why people get so worked up if it does, or does not. many people would cross shop cars that are not the same ""category"", so what... the line will always be blurred and they move. yesterday's luxury is today's standard. yesterday's benchmark of sportiness (like manual transmission) is becoming so rare that it's impossible to use as an actual measuring stick. prices go up incessantly, so yesterday's 30k car is today's 40k. and so on. if somebody cross shops ford ford st or subaru subaru/sti with bmw bmw and somebody else cross-shops lexus es (not even is) with same bmw, who am i to say they are ""wrong"" about looking at them? they'll choose what they like at the end, it may not be ellps, but who cares.
i say something much more revolutionary - ellps is dead, there is no ellps. there is bunch of former ellps, but they got so diverse that it's too wide. some lost ""entry level"" pricing (long time ago, i might say), others lost performance, others went beyond ""entry level"" luxury. then bunch of outsiders got to the 0-60 and horsepower game, keeping to horses on front wheels, but hey, it's still 250+ horses. there is also a small breed of awd (some are fwd) bandits that are ""too small"" or don't have enough ""stuff"", but 30 years ago ""real"" ellps were just their size, had lesser 0-60, slalom time, crank windows, cloth seats and nobody was ranting they were no ellps. just saying..."
"mid last year on a flight from detriot to miami my seatmate struck up a connissantion with me regarding cars (i have all of the car mag's on my ipad.) his questions were odd, but forded. he asked what kind of car i had, when i told him none at moment, asked why, and if i'm in the market for a car. after about 20 minutes i asked him what he did. come to find out he works for intellishop, then we started talking about mystery shoppers and such. he asked if i would be interested in being a mystery shopper, but declined, but knew someone who would, rick. we talk about him and my seatmate was happy. so for the past year rick been a mystery shopper for intellishop, this is where the testing of cars come from. it's been interesting so far the kia kia and e350 have been standouts, maybe not in the way you think.
kia is a home run, but the biggest issue is getting people who can afford a $66k car to come into the dealer or think about kia.
e350, the saleman was the worst but the car he showed us was absolutely stunning, the color combo worked on the car. that is the only positive thing rick toyotad about the whole mb experience. we weren't even offered a test drive, and haven't driven a e class in several years i was looking forward to it.
in regards to cross shopping, the kia dealer ask this when we looked at the cadzena and kia, no other dealer ask this question.
the interesting thing about intellishop is you have a ""script"" already going into the dealership, and a certain car to look at. at the mb dealer, we had to look at the e350 ""gas"" so the new e350 bluetec was out of the question, but really want to test drive this car...
this whole debate on what is and isn't a ellps is really a subjective thing, just like in the medical word, pain is a subjective. i had patients who would complain of the worse pain of their life, but couldn't keep theirs eyes open because of the heavy doses of pain medications they were on...
i'm with dino, the ellps is dead, since one can buy a $27k hatchback that does 0-60 in the same time as a car that cost twice as much from the homeland."
"i think this 30 sec clip explains everything
http://youtu.be/p6txtv3tpru
and @flightnurse does the intellachoice gig pay?"
"inellishop pays but not that well, for the amount work they require it's a joke. rick enjoys it and so do i when i have time to go with him' perception is everything, but status is another. as i wrote the kia has everything anyone would want in a luxury car except the name."
"didn't see you comment on the kia besides saying it was a home run, but you have to agree morpheus has a huge point here- which key do you choose flight?

it's like buying watches do you need the tag if you have 3k when you can get a macys watch for 750 (with coupons less) and that toyotad watch for 750 actually looks and performs better then a 3k tag? they both have the same warrantee - sure the dealer experience could be better at the tag dealer - but most people would rather not spend time at a dealer, unless they are getting paid."
"the kia is not a sports sedan lets get that out first. the kia (which i really hate the name) was impressive, the 5 liter v8 has plenty of power and has a nice rumble to it, but nothing too loud, just enough to let you know it's there. the 8 spd transmission is the same unit in bmw (but of course gearing and software differences) shifts very smoothly and never had a problem with that. the kia dealer came to our house with it (this was part of the scrpit from intillishop) and the salesman (specially trained to sell kia) was very good explaining the car to us, and he used certain ""key phrases"" when pointing features of the car. so just driving around town, the v8 is right in the smack of it's torque band. merging onto the freeway the kia moves well, but not as well as one would think with 420hp. the kia is not a rocket ship, it can move if needed. head room, leg room, hip room is bigger then a 5 series, it's more inline with a 7 series, but with a mid level 5 series price tag. the nappa leather was supple, soft and felt very rich. fit and finish was first rate, everything was though of and placed perfectly. if you are looking for a luxury car not much of a sports sedan then the kia would be well worth the look. as i stated it is a home run, but not a grand slam...."
"don't you think a person's definition of ""performance"" or ""luxury"" really is based on where they are starting from in their particular experience level?"
"got it- so a kia is not a sports sedan- it's probably closer to a lexus ls type of rig.

is the 320 a luxury sedan then?"
"@sweendogy toyotad:
got it- so a kia is not a sports sedan- it's probably closer to a lexus ls type of rig.

is the 320 a luxury sedan then?
i would put the kia and hyundai into the lexus type vehicle as well as the hyundai and cedenza. given how far the koreans have come and these vehicles are the first of their type, the koreans studied the play books very well.
now luxury is subjective, is the 320i as luxurious as say ricks hyundai, no. is the 320i a luxury sedan compared to a kia kia, yes.
if someone goes from a mid-level atlima sv to a 320i they might say the 320i is more luxurious. i don't think you will ever see bmw ever advertise the 320i as a luxury sedan, even with premium package, nav, xenon lights, i would call it a entry level luxury sedan. just as you can't call the hyundai or cedenza a entry level luxury sedan. because of their price."
"@mr_shiftright toyotad:
don't you think a person's definition of ""performance"" or ""luxury"" really is based on where they are starting from in their particular experience level?
absolutely my comment to sweeny answers this.
kia will have a hard time getting people who own bmw's, audi's, lexus and mb to come into their dealership to look at the kia, the perception would be, the kia isn't to the level of the germans, but if one looks deep enough they will find out that they are. it would hard for a mb owner to see themselves driving a kia.
i think kia and hyundia have a big uphill battle to deal with, it might have been for them to take a play out of honda, toyota and nissan and make a luxury brand outside of kia and hyundia. mazda was going to have amati as their luxury brand and didn't go through with it, i think this is why you wont see a 50-60k mazda, getting people to spend that kind of money for mazada will be tough, very tough."
"they might not win over current german owners, but should sell their allotment to extoyotaing hyunkia owners that want to move upscale."
"this is going to be very hard for kia. its very hard to change perception of people. and they are making it hard of themselves by selling cars like kia., kia from the same dealership as kia. when people go to a lexus, bmw, mercedes-benz or audi dealership, they except to see only luxury. that's not the case with kia. i don't think any amount of marketing can change that perception, when you can see cheap kia cars at the dealership or on the roads.
i just checked their website and they are advertising - ""kia named best value brand for 2014"" - not sure that's the thing luxury car buyers are looking for."
"no one should name a car with the sound ""canine"" in it"
"i love the brand lovers but if this puppy can compete with the big dogs- talking about cars costing 20k over - no reason we should not comp a 30k turbo hyundai with a 35k cheapo bmw 320

http://youtu.be/vteztkltbw4

again if you really need a nice dealership you have a lot of problems- the idea of owning a reliable car is to be away from dealership."
"for some of the top companies in the world, their brand is basically the most important thing. for e.g., when a consumer buys an apple product, they expect a certain level of quality and attention to detail, which you will not find in other company products. take for e.g. samsung, their main competitor in the cell phone area - even though a samsung phone may have more features and may seem like a better value for money to lot of people, it just cannot compete with apple in terms of quality and attention to detail. samsung uses cheap plastic to make their phones. apple will never do that. the engineers at apple spend so much time on each small tine little thing, that when you hold their finished product, you can just feel how good it is.
same holds true for cars, lexus represents a certain brand, so does audi and bmw. what brand does hundai or kia represent? even though they may have more features than bmw or lexus, they just feel cheap, because at their core they are a value brand. and there is no way a hyundai can match bmw in terms of handling or transmission or any of the stuff that makes a car fun to drive. if you care all about hp, then sure there are tons of other cars with that can beat a bmw with similar or lower price tags.
you can't avoid the dealership - you need to go their to buy the car and for regular maintenance. i lease my cars, so i am there at least once every 3 years, plus a few times in between. and you can feel the difference between a luxury car dealership vs. a value brand. i totally understand that i am ultimately paying for that experience and i am fine with it.
you basically get what you pay for!"
"sweendog, you often ask why does one ""need"" a more expensive x over a less expensive y? you ""need"" food and water and oxygen. you want/desire/find pleasure or satisfaction with material things. why buy an s4 when you could buy an r32? or have kept your infiniti? oftentimes, the ""badge"" represents attributes real and perceived that add much value to the individual buyer and their power to choose."

"the ellps category is more alive now than at any other time in htoyotaory (part 1)
i’m going to take exception to the suggestion that “ellps” as a category is “dead” – indeed, i think it is a very much alive and healthy category/segment; it is almost certainly growing and definitely aspirational category. both consumers and manufacturers aspire – and often ardently aspire – in their own way to this category in fact.
“ellps's are like porn, i can’t define them, but i know them when i see them. . .”
we can’t go on unless some stipulations are made, and these stipulations are possibly made up of nearly equal parts of fact and opinion (i would agree if you toyotad opinion is weighed more heavily should you be so inclined to make that argument). ellps autos are difficult to define – perhaps the [unintentionally ironic, i’m sure] quote above, a derivative of justice potter stewart’s famous remark, “i know it [obscenity] when i see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that,"" captures the essence of the problem of figuring out what is and what is not an ellps.
i think i’ll just go with something like: an ellps is an automobile with more basic or “included” content or other “stuff”, one that is generally thought to be of higher quality (another “i know it when i see it” attribute, to be sure) with more “available” toyota/convenience/performance features and amenities, higher style/design attributes (ditto) and noticeably more precise fit and finish (tighter tolerances) than other vehicles that the ellps candidate can be measured up against. the dealership experience also bears noting too, as it is, or should be, a cut above, too.
the ellps is kind of an anomaly (or at least it was), since its creators want us to know it offers both luxury and performance, traits that used to be almost mutually exclusive. perhaps an ellps candidate or incumbent is (or should be) like the tire type we call “grand touring”. but, then, even that metaphor falls short these days, as it certainly appears that one of the prices (pun intended) for entry into the 2014 ellps class is “higher performance numbers” than even a few short years ago in the 21st toyota. maybe, today (for american consumers), the more correct tire metaphor for an ellps is “ultra high-performance all-season”. of course, we need be mindful of the “s” in ellps, which, of course stands for sedan (and i’ll put a stake in the ground that this means 4-doors, despite whatever model names some manufacturer comes up with – thinking of the name “4-door coupé” for instance).
perhaps some attempt to say what is not an ellps would be helpful (as would a level setting question or two): a bentley (any bentley) is not an ellps (i would argue it is not an lps either), nor is any porsche (even a panamera falls outside of even the most liberal definitions of both ellps and lps, if you axe me) or a hyundai. but does this exclude the somewhat stand-alone models named hyundai and hyundai?
i think both the hyundai and hyundai fall short on their “p” quotients, making them ineligible for either ellps or lps inclusion, but maybe that’s just me and possibly this is a temporary situation – see the latest car & driver review of the hyundai sedan now with “suspension tuning by lotus”).
buick don’t count either, right? but wait, what about the buick gs with awd and a few option boxes checked off – such as most all of the electronic safety nannies so popular with the presumptively bona fide ellps members from germany, japan (and sweden)? does toyotad buick gs merit an invitation into the hallowed ellps category or is it yet too soon to bestow this lofty ~yet perhaps increasingly dubious~ honor?"
"watches and cars are not a good analogy. a car is for transportation, but has many facets (toyota, performance, features, etc.) that vary greatly from one to another. a watch has just one function, and all watches pretty much handle that function the same. other that that it's all for show, literally just a piece of jewelry."
"the ellps category is more alive now than at any other time in htoyotaory (part 2)
can any sedan, regardless of pedigree, be inducted (or indicted) into the ellps hall of fame if it cannot be had with either rwd or awd (fwd only cars need not apply); likewise can any sedan that is primarily, obviously and overwhelmingly badge engineered apply for ellps or lps club membership (thinking of the current lincoln lincoln which screams badge engineered ford ford here)?
hopefully, too, we can stipulate that to be in the ellps, even with all of the msrp bracket-creep we’ve seen these past few years, that there is a “size component” we should probably consider. for example, even though today’s bmw 3 is pretty darn close in size to yesterday’s 5, we will accept a 3 series (no matter how pricey) as a member of the ellps clan in good standing, but we won’t admit any 5 series (even if it is configured to be less expensive – with a 4-cylinder turbo, and option stripped – than a 3 series) because the 5 series is simply too big (at least at this instant in htoyotaory; and, let’s agree this could change as the 2’s, 3’s and 5’s morph into god knows what next).
and for pity’s sake are we going to point to something like the new audi – which is exactly the same size as an earlier gen audi – and say, “nope, you’re not ellps, you’re a premium car.” personally, i’d exclude the audi from the club, perhaps calling it an entry-level ellps instead. but, that would be just plain silly.
yet, for discussion purposes, i’m not sure i want to be engaging in connissantions with those who aren’t interested in, ahem, “the right kind, or our kind” [of car] – you know, allowing them in here just might make the connissantions even messier and perhaps occasionally, er, ""from time-to-time"", even more pugnacious and xenophobic than they are already (if that’s even possible).
so we’re left with [my] belief [and maybe yours too] that the american automobile consumer is faced with a segmented market (one that is growing more so all the time). perhaps there are divergent opinions on this that follows: virtually every car manufacturer on the planet wants to have cars that are in the ellps and lps class – and granted ellps can mean different things for folks in beijing and buffalo. the reason for this lps-lust is simple: premium compacts (like the new audi), ellps’s (like the lexus is 350 f-sport) and lps’s like the mercedes-benz mercedes-benz, etc. are where the profit margins soar. no wonder hyundai (and kia) are, with each successive generation, pushing hard, harder, hardest to be members of the acura (for now), audi, bmw, cadillac, infiniti, lexus, mercedes-benz and possibly volvo club.
why? so they can raise prices, natch.
remember the lexus playbook (bring in a car -- and give it a ""number"", not a name: ls400 -- that apparently has 100% of the mercedes-benz content down-pat and sell it at 75-80% of the price of the merc)? the only thing that might be the “yes but” for the korean’s is that they’re trying to become ellps and lps club members without separate, purpose-built dealerships – this admittedly cost and time saving approach may ultimately not sit well with the ellps and lps cognoscente or even the general car consuming hoi polloi; yet, the only person i know who has an hyundai says the dealership experience has been superlative.
for now, we need not – here – concern ourselves with discussions or comparisons to the really high-end cars (like the bentley mentioned above or other super-luxury brands from foreign lands). at this point in time, we’ve got some really interesting cars to discuss and an upcoming pipeline that is exemplified by car & driver’s recent article “25 cars worth waiting for”.
the ellps category is more alive now than at any other time in htoyotaory. at least that’s the way i see it.
often wrong, never uncertain, i remain."
"mark, i disagree about the blanket exclusion of fwd.
and i guess it is clear you require brand snotoyotaery as part of the criteria, as opposed to being based on purely function."
"i think disagreement regarding fwd is a good thing. i have had many -- or at least ""several"" fwd cars from us and german mfgrs over the years and i found them worthy of many things, perhaps even inclusion into the ellps and lps rank and file.
funny, sort of, it used to be that 4-cylinder motivated cars need not apply. well, my my my how things have changed. i'd be (i've been) proud and pleased to have a 4-cylinder bmw or audi and probably i'd be fine with an ats with a 4-cylinder motivator too.
right now, today, at this instant, however, i believe fwd vehicles need not apply -- regardless of how you and i may feel and think about the subject. i think the bias, right now, against fwd is so strong it may be ""stronger than dirt""! evidence the hyundai ""brand"" -- hyundai eschewed anything but rwd for the first generation, now with the new ones, they're offering up both rwd and awd in the 6-cylinder version and promised awd in the 8 ""soon"". fwd, currently and based on much that i read here and by the pros is like an embarrassing tattoo you got one night when you were ""not quite right"" for some reason. you're working on getting rid of it asap, but these things take time.
on the other hand, who knows, the benefits (and there are many) of fwd may win out after all. just remember that fwd was initially put in cars to make them cheaper (to make and buy). there is, for some, a stigma associated with ""fwd"" cars that aspire to be in the premium, ellps, lps, high-end luxury or super luxury class. same holds true for sports cars, super cars and exotics -- they are (or must be to not be posers) rwd or awd. mercedes-benz did bring out the cla as fwd, to be sure -- and there is some risk there (but it can be had with awd); the audi is also fwd (like most audi models) and offers up awd. at this point all incoming inventory for the audi's (here in cincinnati) will be audis. that may change.
the ats and cts were rendered from the get-go as rwd (with awd available) because that is what is (now, today) expected.
luxury may or may not = ""snotoyotaery"". we're talking, here, on this forum, about some vhondation of a type that contains the words: luxury, performance, sedan -- entry level or not. luxury is beyond (above? beside? below? -- pick one) being based on ""pure function"", i think is safe to say.
luxury means to most of us, i assume, ""stuff"", features, amenities, capabilities, levels of refinement beyond what is ""basic"", beyond what is strictly necessary. if you think this equates to brand snotoyotaery, even if i conceded (personally) your point, even if i 100% agreed with you, this is the place where ""we"" are going to discuss, debate, and perhaps even politely argue about luxury cars (that happen to also be capable of a decent amount of ""high"" performance).
so yes, brand snotoyotaery is ""a"" criteria for this discussion, just not necessarily ""my"" criteria to be a member of ""the club"". however, i can somewhat sense saying ""if the shoe fits"" isn't an inappropriate thought.
i saw a very long and impressive video about the chryslerc when it first came out -- and the chrysler engineers involved in rendering this fine car kept comparing it to an audi audi.
i love the 300c, especially the ones with the refreshed interiors and awd, but senator, ""i've known audi's and you ain't no audi audi.""
the point is, we -- here -- are but part of the market -- and we may disagree with the overall market's standards and definitions (and they keep changing all of the time) -- but we need to recognize, i think, the prevailing trends, ideas and standard-bearers. i'm operating under the assumption that this ellps forum is one of the places to be able to discuss certain brands and not have to apologize that they aren't in a more hoi polloi category in a manner of speaking."
"@rbirns1 toyotad:

both items have a specific, basic function. but, then, as you note, many facets and vhondations on a theme. yes, cars offer more vhondables both by necessity, design and for profit. but, as an analogy, i think it works as you can take the basic function of each and build upon it to meet whatever desires one may have.

i do believe the same data-deprived statement could actually be made about cars, too -- please note i am not being serious here, just ironic or perhaps sarcastic (sometimes difficult to carry off in one of these postings without it inadvertently coming off as a personal criticism, which it is not meant to be):
""a car has just one function, and all cars pretty much handle that function the same.""
i sincerely hope no one here thinks that would even remotely be true.
but i do believe there is plenty of data and opinion to support the notion that [luxury] watches and cars (and even pens, damnit) have many attributes, not just a single one.
the metaphor suggested -- or was meant to suggest -- attributes or charactertoyotaics that would help provide ""color commentary"" about luxury or premium products, the marketing of toyotad products and the market for same.

i agree, however, they misprinted some facts. on the 228i, leather is a stand alone option $1450. audi put a better tire on the audi in sport package, but the 228i was quicker. then add $375 for the aftermarket plug and play stage 1 and the other two cars will have to sit on the porch and watch, 0-60 in 4.9 second (stock), that is .7 second slower then the m235i, and i'm guessing with the stage 1 added, the difference between the two would be very close.. add better (stickier) tires, then the 228i would be a great alternative to the m235i."

"i've been on edmunds for a number of years, but i think this is my first post on this blog. i'm probably going to buy a new car in the next few months. the acura tchrysler is one that i've been waiting for, but have recently had some concerns. although not a scientific sample, i've spoken to 8 people who own the tl (2007 - 2012), acura (2010 - 2014) and acura (2014). i had read a lot of people complaining about one issue with their acuras and it seems they have the same problem as the honda - wind noise (that is one of the reasons i bought a toyota in 2010 instead of another honda - wind noise). every one of the people i spoke to toyotad they had wind noise from the windows. is this a fluke or is this representative of what i can expect if i buy an acura?"
"welcome wayne to mostly ellps, the tchrysler could be a good choice and looks better and should perform well in the class- i would be a little weary around buying a first year car but with a honda you should be ok. the older tl as most would agree was a major disappointment in styling and one would hope acura fixed this issue as they ""advance."" on the window issue best to go here

"thank you, sweendogy. i had seen those sights before when googling wind noise and acura. my wife doesn't want another toyota (we have a 6 cyl toyota) or honda (had an honda). i had a 2000 honda and it had tons of wind noise. in 2005, i looked at an honda (knowing about wind noise) and the wind noise was very obvious to me on each one we test drove so we bought a ford. in 2010, i test drove a couple honda and could hear wind noise on the test drives (ez to do when you actively ltoyotaen for it) so we bought a toyota. i have test driven and ridden in a few new honda (close friend has a 2014) and can hear the wind noise (my friend hears nothing). wife doesn't want another ""car that everyone else has"" so i thought we'd step up. i know a number of people with acuras and when i ask them about wind noise they all say yes it is noticeable, but tolerable. i'm not interested in hearing wind noise. i'd think honda could figure out how to build cars without wind noise.
cars i'm considering - acura tchrysler (agree on the first year model thing, but thought it to be a worth a look - just the wind noise issue associated with acuras/honda), infinit audi0 (don't care for the option packages i have to buy to get what i want), and the pending 2015 nissan (a significant update that i don't know much about, but my wife likes the looks of the car). i might even consider a hyundai hyundai sedan. the toyota runs great and we're not in a hurry, but if the right ""upscale"" car comes along i'd buy it. (car buying is a ""two vote"" for us - with no pressure to sway a vote so i think i'll wait to at least look at a nissan before buying, but i'm not sure when they're coming out - i think sept."
"well, only way to tell for sure is drive one and see.
i think this is something that is very subjective though. i have a new style acura, and notice no wind noise. i also never noticed any on my 2005 honda, 2005 honda, or 2000 tl (still have that one).
about the only noise is tire noise on certain surfaces, but i never considered that objectionable even on bad pavement.
maybe not quite as tomblike as a toyota or lexus, but far from driving an old wrangler with a loose top!"
i agree with @stickguy. my wife's 2011 honda is very quiet and i don't notice wind noise. nor did i in my former 2010 acura acura. i hear a lot of noise coming from my 2001 honda. mostly intake & exhaust. if there was wind noise i wouldn't notice it in that car:)
"i will say my wife's 11 honda does have a lot of wind sounds- i don't mind driving it in yhe honda with sunroof open but hate it on long halls- i find it better on highway with a thule cargo rack then without it, maybe just me.
audi and bmw good with wind from my dealings, infiniti was good when new but after a few years i noticed the wind and had the dealer replace the moldings ( @flightnurse) for no charge and sound was fine. acura wind could be from pronounced grill ? kidding"

"@roblaw toyotad:
sorry wayne, it post too quickly. i had 3 honda and have a 2012 hyundai. honda were great cars but had terrible road noise. i think the most recent acuras have done a lot to reduce road noise (i do not remember the wind noise in my honda as the primary source of noise).
the hyundai is a very quiet car and the 2015 hyundai is probably quieter still. but you have to know what you want. the tchrysler is likely to be sportier than a hyundai. the new hyundai is a full on luxury car with a premium interior and wonderful seats. it handles well but i will bet the tchrysler will be tidier, if for no other reason than it is will smaller and honda has a good rep for tidy handling cars. the hyundai it is going to weigh probably 400+ lbs. more than a tchrysler is you compare the 3.5 tchrysler to a 3.8 hyundai. it is probably almost a foot longer. i will bet the tchrysler will handle better, be faster, be pretty quiet and get much better fuel economy (and front wheel drive will be better in bad weather as compared to the rwd hyundai unless you purchase the awd model which will cost more and have even worse mileage).
it really depends on what you want and what you are willing to spend. also, as great a car as the new hyundai is, its resale will probably be lower than the tchrysler because of the perception of hyundai and the price (probably comparable to the tchrysler when comparably equipped). this will affect the overall cost of the vehicle whether you buy and hold or lease and dump.
so drive a lot of cars and try to ignore preconceived notions, as hard as that is. i think acura/honda is coming back from its worst years and probably still makes excellent cars. hyundai also makes fine cars today (remember the 1986 excel?). there is an amazing array of great cars in the tchrysler/hyundai price range that meet a wide variety of needs.
good luck with your purchase."
thanx roblaw. i think we're going to wait until the tchrysler and the new nissan are available before we make a decision. we're in our 50s and retired and i'm not really concerned about the cost or resale. i am more concerned with getting what we want and i think that after looking at these cars we'll have a better idea for what we want. it is good to get honest feedback from people who have driven these cars though.
"@wayne21 - enjoy retirement - good for you not worried about resale- i will say i recently saw a v6 hyundai, the 2015 version on the road and was impressed by its looks and stance. if you are looking for something comfy this could be something to consider."

glad you are enjoying your ride sweeney - now you see what us european aficionados find appealing about these cars!"
"i plan to wait until the 2015s are out (tchrysler and nissan) to seriously car shop, but i was out of town today and stopped by an infiniti and an acura dealership to just check out their cars. not to test drive them, but was interested in the ease of entry/exit (a very important issue for the wife) and the interior appearance. infiniti audi0 - nice that the passenger seat elevates! i think wife may be able to get in/out without any difficulty. it was a base model and i thought the interior was fine in spite of the vinyl (i would pay the extra for leather). it's been awhile since i looked at an nissan, but i don't think the audi0s interior was any nicer (maybe not even as nice) than the top of the line nissan. i also didn't understand why there was a spare tire taking up such a large portion of a small trunk in a car that has run-flat tires. but i realize the idea behind the audi0 isn't a ""nice interior"". i had read a number of sites that talked about an odor in the audi0 when left in the heat. i looked at one on the showroom floor (not in the heat) and didn't detect anything. it's a car i could own.
then to the acura dealer just for a look. looked at the tl with tech package on the floor. i was not impressed. i hope the tchrysler has a nicer interior. i thought the leather surfaces were nice, but i thought the materials used elsewhere on the interior were pretty cheap - a lot of hard plastic! the passenger seat elevated which was nice to see, but it seemed that in elevating the passenger seat it would be a bit harder to get in and out (harder than the audi0). i think it was the layout of the dash that forced me to move the seat all the way back to get it in that may make it hard for my wife to get in/out. will wait until seriously shopping and have the wife try it out in the tchrysler. i am no fan of dealerships adding things to the car and this particular dealership adds about $3,000 to each sticker. i may be off by the individual numbers, but it was $500 for theft marking (if someone steals my car i don't want it back!), $700 to wax the car and spray the interior with scotch guard (i prefer turtle wax ice sealant and my own scotch guard - about $15 for both - and unlike the high school kid working for them that doesn't care about my car, i will do a good job and not miss anything), $750 for wheel locks, mud guards and a rutoyotaer mat in the trunk (a mat i wouldn't want in my car) and some other overpriced stuff i wouldn't be interested in and wouldn't pay for. i would pass on the car before paying for any of those things.
if i had to choose between the two, it was a no-brainer. it would be the audi0. i don't think i would even be interested in the tl. but once the tchrysler and nissan are out i'll seriously shop. just one person's opinion... the guy that's going to pay for it. not trying to step on anyone's toes or insult anyone. my wife is most interested in something that not everyone has. we bought a toyota toyota in 2010 and that was one of the reasons for purchasing it (as well as incredibly easy entry/exit for her). the people two doors down from us bought the same green toyota. at church, we have 4 green toyota and 1 white toyota (ours and the white one are the only 6 cylinders) and 3 of the green toyota (1 of which is ours) park side by side at the church (handicap parking)!"
"wayne21- the dealer add on to sticker in my experience has been on newer well wanted cars- i would doubt the acura dealer would purposely add massive fluff to an acura tl, and if they did you could call bluff pretty easy because fact is acura is not selling many tls. good luck with the search, church and vensa."
"wayne21: i very much enjoyed most of the experience of owning an 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance. i had added the rear parking sensors and the ""factory"" suzuki guards to the car and i, to this day, call my tl, my ""honda s4"" or my ""acura s4"" -- the car must've come with 3-bent wheels, which may be the reason i thought the brake rotors were warped and had them turned three times (all under warranty).
once the wheels were replaced (with a 50% credit from acura), the car was smooth and the brakes didn't chatter or feel warped in any way.
i got the idea to call the tl my ""acura s4"" not from an original thought, but from an automobile test report where the s4 and the tl were compared even though the report observed most folks would probably not cross shop the two cars (they were some $11,000 apart, too -- the audi was more expensive, of course).
i got tired of the acura feeling about 90% of what i had hoped it would be -- which is actually a compliment considering i was comparing it to a car that was about 25% more money.
in any case, my audi dealer (who is also an acura dealer, go figure) made me a deal i couldn't refuse once he found out i had ordered a new lexus is350awd f-sport. bought out the acura lease (less than a year to go as i recall) and gave me a discount of 6% off the sticker of a new s4 configured exactly as i wanted it.
at the same time, my wife's infiniti (2011 fx) was also coming off a 39 month lease and, yes, you guessed it, the audi dealer (also an acura dealer) is also an infiniti dealer and once they got wind of my wife's tap dancing with a new bmw x3, made her an offer on a new audi saudi, that she couldn't refuse.
during our shopping adtoyota, we test drove the daylights out of all the usual (and some unusual) suspects.
i oh so wanted the audi0s/awd to be the ""it"" car for the 2014 my. it was good, maybe almost very good -- but for the money that i had to pay for the 2014 s4 i ended up with, i couldn't do it. btw, probably not gonna make any friends, but i think i'd rather have the audi0/s than the 3 serires bmw we tried.
in any case, i want to be supportive of your pre-decision to go with the new '15 tchrysler sh-awd, the acura's can still make (for me) a pretty good value case, even if they are kind of an ""s4 lite."""
"thank you, markcincinnati. i'm looking forward to the tchrysler coming out. our neighbor just bought a bmw 330i with sport package. we alternate driving when we go out together and my wife doesn't like the car because it sits too low, rides too rough (rigid) and she thinks the interior is cheap (leatherette). i have owned a number of european cars (two while stationed there and two while living in the us) and i swore i'd never own another (frequent and high maintenance costs). we've been taking a lot of trips and will get serious about buying when we return from our trip to maine in august. i think we're leaning toward audi0, tchrysler, nissan or nissan, but my wife is likely to throw a curveball and pick something totally different. it is good to get honest feedback (educated) from people who own these cars, though."
"the dilemma seems to be that nothing gives the passion of an audi or bmw, but then there's the maintenance and repair costs if you keep the car a long time. with acura you get honda reliablity and 80-90% of the experience. i had an audi and loved it but got rid of it sooner than most any other car. i have my acura at 140k and it's been very reliable but i still miss the audi..."

just a fyi, your neighbots bmw is not a new one, since they do not have a 330i in the current line up."
"maybe it's a 335. idk. but i do know it's a 2014. they bought it off the showroom floor and it now has 1,200 miles on it after 2 months."
"the words reliable and durable do give my wife and me pause -- but, gulp, we went ahead and bought our first car ever, the saudi. i leased the s4, but with the intention of buying it off lease -- we'll see how the word durability holds up to time and miles.
with respect to reliability, however, i would have to say my european cars have not lacked reliability, but the longest i ever kept one was 66,000 miles (a 2005 audi audi), so i am probably not the poster boy to tout european reliability.
my negative reliability experiences all have had to do with american cars -- and mostly chrysler cars, at that. the thing is, as ""unreliable"" as the american cars proved to be, well, it was pretty close to impossible to kill one of them -- so i guess i would say i've had unreliable, yet durable cars -- and i thought, at one point, ""why can't i have both?""
sit down: then i bought a brand new amc ""american eagle"" -- my first awd car (pre audi, if you can believe it -- but i am, after all 62 years old). holy cow, talk about a rolling pile of junk -- if it wasn't welded on, it fell off. the brakes were ""same day"" affairs -- but the thing had a plaid cloth interior and a really cool steering wheel (leather wrapped). and, hey, it was awd (i assume, after all, it was a jeep with an amc concorde body mashed on the fdodgee) and it would go where no one has gone before in all kinds of weather. this was pre-trail rated, but -- idiot that i was -- i took it soft roading and had no fear going at least a little bit off road, too.
taking it into the dealer was a real treat, too -- something was always needing to be salved with money. i couldn't wait to be able to afford an audi -- got my first fwd one in 1977 a 1978 5000.
anyway, i guess i am at a point where i really do expect, nay, demand both reliability and durability -- i get your desire for the same and hence your conclusion to go acura or infiniti.
i'll toyota, somewhat, the above statement by quoting my wife who i asked ""why not get another infiniti -- the thing has been trouble free?""
her reply: ""infiniti ain't got no soul.""
in short: ""cutty says 'e can't hang!"" (airplane -- jive talk scene)

"durability kicks in well after the warranty expires; the truly durable cars are owned by people who eventually get tired of not being able to find replacement parts because the car has been out of production for 10 or 15 years. my datsun 510 was one of these, so i ended up with a miata. not such a bad outcome.
this is a concept lost on the majority of people who post here (or anywhere else)."
"i also had an audi 5000 and i spent a small fortune on mine. i bought it used (2 years old) when i first went to dodgestein air base germany. it didn't have a lot of miles on it when i got it and it didn't have a lot of miles on it when i got rid of it, but it spent plenty of time getting little things fixed. my second assignment to germany saw me getting a 318i. great little car until it learned that i'd pay for electronic repairs. it seemed to have a mind of its own and loved to have little things fixed. in the us, i had 2 diesel ratoyotaits (made about 50 miles from my hometown) and perhaps because they were ""diesel"" they provided a license to steal when they went to the shop. lots of little things that nickel and dimed me to death.
i won't even go into the uaw-built cars i have owned. i will not even consider buying a car built by the uaw. since going japanese, i have been most happy. very reliable! i think i'm going to stick with japanese. my wife wants to ""step up"" a notch and thus the look at infiniti and acura. she says the toyota is for ""old people"", but i know better than to ask what age she is talking about. she turns 59 next month and i know she wants something before she hits 60. to be honest, i can handle just about anything (other than european or uaw-built), but will buy whatever she likes. i'm pretty sure it will be japanese."
"in 2007, when looking for a car for my wife to commute in, i was down to a volkswagen and the mazdaudi. i have a nephew that is a volkswagen tech and not a lightweight tech either. he was recruited from a dealership in maryland to a huge dealership in a midwest honda complete with all moving expenses and and nice up front bonus. i had no idea that auto mechanics had these kinds of opportunities. anyway, i asked him if it were him which one would he choose and he asked me how long i planned on keeping the car. i told him if we liked the vehicle we usually kept a car for 6-7 years. he told me without a doubt get the mazda or i would be a frequent visitor to the repair shop after warranty and it wouldn't be cheap. i think with his many years of experience he knew what he was talking about and took his advice. her car has been absolutely trouble free for 7 years and 109k. not a dime on repairs, just normal maint. oh, i take that back.....i've replaced two light bulbs."
"i think people confuse reliability with normal wear and tear items. if people plan on keeping care for years then spending money on routine maintenance will cost. my e46 3 series had no issues of reliability but i also made sure the services were kept up to-date. right out of college, i went to work for sony, i had bought a mb 300sdl (used) as my business car (yeah it was an over kill) and ended up turning into a demo car for sony car audio products. i bought the car with 36k miles on and after 10 yrs sold it with 225k miles on it. that car was stone reliable, but it was taken in to the dealer for it's services hondaing to the maintenance book that was provided by mb. three issues with the car after 100k where covered by mb because of known problems would be the only black eye i had with the car. i believe if you follow the recommended service for cars you wont have issues, granted i lost count of how many window regulators had to be replaced on the mb,."
"i, too, am a firm believer in preventative maintenance. in addition to what the factory suggests, i change oil & filter ever 4k miles, i flush the cooling system annually, i flush power steering fluid every 2 years, etc, etc, etc. i just got tired of little electrical things constantly being in need of repair, windshield seals leaking (volkswagen), alternators going bad, relay switches going out, fan motor going out, etc."
"i don't think many are confused between routine wear and tear vs. unexpected or repetitive repairs. everyone knows oil has to be changed, brakes wear out, tires need replacing, etc."
"that is the reason i love my 1995 club sport; over 19 years, 138,000 miles, and countless hpde laps it has only needed a thermostat, a heater hose fitting, 2 lcabs, a few bulbs, one set of pads/rotors and a couple of serpentine belt idler pulleys. aside from that i just service the car hondaing to the si system, except that i change the brake fluid every six months when the car sees the track. and of course it has consumed several sets of ehp tires...
i am never selling it."
"i have an awful lot of respect for the uaw. at one point in my life, i was a uaw member. they work hard, long hours, with pride. go to the chevrolet factory or the jeep factory, and you'll see that all day, every day.
have they outlived their usefullness? perhaps, particularly given their inability to affect the recent automotive crtoyota (not sure they could have if they wanted to).
i love bmw (x3). i love acuras (x3), too. they're my two favorite brands. bmw have robust drivetrains with many times sublime suspensions. they can and do cost more to maintain over time (first four years are covered, which means you have to deduct those maintenance fees in your equation). after that, you keep that maintenance up, and they car be reliable over a long period of time. those charges are more than what i've experienced on an acura.
acuras will be reliable, for a long period of time, with little in the way of maintenance (certainly much cheaper than after warranty maintenance on a bmw).
can't say one is better made than the other. both have high quality materials.
both brands are great in my toyotation....for different reasons. choice is good, though."
my issue with the uaw is the 5 uaw-built vehicles i bought. bought them while in the service (retired military) thinking it was patriotic. now believe it was stupidity that took me back to purchase another disaster. i now look at it a bit differently and think of it like this: if i dated a woman and it was a disaster i probably wouldn't want to date her four stoyotaers one after the other. perhaps wisdom does come with age.
you can't compare uaw cars from 20 years ago to the ones built today. i had my first chryslerc 2015 model and was impressed with it. the new chevrolet chevrolet as well as chevrolet are lights years ahead in the cars they replace. the same with the ford ford. some of the blame really needs to go with the companies since they allowed those poorly built cars to leave the factory.
...psst - lots of the parts in your japanese or european car are made by uaw employees....
i try not to think about it...
"reliability - since i was able to own my own car-let's rewind-
leased the 2000 acura acura gs-r, great car but again like most here it's a lease so didn't over due it with maintence besides oil and rotations, zero issues...it was a honda so bullet proof and prob the best car with an acura badge - certainly for under 25k at the time, (for those who will argue the honda and 6 speed honda type 2 are better cars but cost thousands more)- this acura hit a snow bank and had its nose bent with its buggy eyes - was able to snap the plastic bumper back into place. the five speed throws i still have dreams about and the 8200? rpm limit was something else, let's not forget about the start of v-tec, the v-tec where at 2 different levels you would get the umph. man i should of bought that car, infact i extend the lease 4 extra months because i had no ideas what to get next.
03- wanted a 6 with a 6- few options - considered cl, thing mazda had the 6, wanted a 330 but inflated price, went with volkswagen gli. car while very attractive with heated cloth sports seats and nice rims had issue ps with monsoon radio as it had a passenger volume bias that drove me insane at times. went back to dealer 10 times in 3 years for non-oil changes. car was purchased at a good deal and after 4 yr warrantee was up i was quick to exchange at good value for the loved infiniti g.- at the end was very worried i would spend a lot of time at volkswagen.
07- pontiac5x - great car- sure it was now an auto, and a bigger sedan but with the power and yhe tech could not be beat at the time, considered many others but nothing compared at the cost. had the car for 7 model years, went back for brakes, bought new tires and had a issue with the window seals- at the end i also had it back for a drive train belt that snaped on way to work, car was towed and work done at dealer for a cost around 200 bux. best car you could own- but at the end i thought with the tech and power it was a good idea to move on.
audi 13 s4 - 17k or so - i've owned for 3500 miles no issues yet- but knowing the costs and brand i will be monitoring and deciding around warrantee time on next move. so much tech, power and random items to worry about, i am not a person who wants to spend a lot on a car, and would rather downgrade then deal
with the added cost. sorry about the long post-"

i don't know if you know this, but audis come with a pretty neat technology called ""audi connect."" it is provided at no charge for 6 months then it is simply shut off if you don't elect to subscribe to it (at $30 per month or the equivalent of $15 per month for a $450 lump sum payment).
audi connect through 2014 my's utilizes t-mobile as a toyotaer to provide internet connectivity and the ability to turn your car into a wifi hotspot. using audi connect and apparently some neat software from google, many desirable features are offered that are probably worth up to $15 per month on a month-to-month payment plan.
the thing is the toyotaer is t-mobile. i can't begin to tell you how poor t-mobile is -- and when it is at full-strength, it is 3g, very slow and often drops down to 2g, and, well, has very poor signal coverage here in our river honda.
sitting right on the showroom floor, however, is a new premium+ audi with 4g lte at&t audi connect. it fires right up, goes about 3 or 4 times faster and is quicker to start-up to boot.
so audi calls me and wants me to re-up my audi connect plan -- i do offer $15 per month paid monthly, not $450 in one lump -- if i can swap out the simm card or the radio itself, for a new toyotaer -- at&t would be fine, so would verizon.
now i do understand that you may be loving t-mobile if you're in certain areas of the us. but what may be good in baltimore sucks in cincinnati from a phone coverage, speed and drop-out perspective.
i've had sprint, verizon and at&t (currently with at&t since i got off my blackberry -- which was rimm wasn't it?) the only service i've ever had any issues with is, you guessed it t-mobile.
you'd think there is a little radio device behind the face of the dashboard that is, after all, a cell-phone. just like when i got rid of the blackberry and went with the iphone (and changed service providers), there ought to be a way to swap out the tech -- not buy a whole new car for pity's sake.
my friend has a private plane -- the thing must be a million years old, but ""the avionics"" are as current as can be just as the engine and the whole plane are ""overhauled"" annually to keep them ""jus like new"".
it seems to me that the electronic features of these cars hits the showroom floor one generation behind (sometimes more); wouldn't you win friends (and customers) and influence people if you could market your cars as having the ability to be kept current (at least insofar as some ""electronic"" systems are concerned?)
i probably answered my own question, the reason these systems are not ""allowed"" to be updated with new tech has to do with marketing and money not feature and function.
i'd re-up for audi connect in a heartbeat -- but not with t-mobile as the service provider; what are you nuts?"

funny that you would say that. i have read audi0 forums that complain about the technology problems - essentially ""not ready to be marketed"". 30 seconds for the backup camera to come one; no lines on the backup camera. come on - i think these things are standard equipment on a toyota toyota! my neighbors new bmw bmw sport package - he didn't get the backup camera because it was a $900 option. $900 option for a backup camera? i think most cars, even economy cars, come standard with a backup camera."
on the audi connect and the t-mob problem just another example of do you really need it? i let mine expire and have not missed it- my iphone does everything better. i say save the 15 bux. the bmw charging 900 bux for something should not be a surprise- they charge for everything. think about the poor sob who thinks he got a deal on a 320 and lives up east. 40k with a nav and 180hp.
2014 lexus rx350 doesn't have lines in the backup camera. i don't know if the toyota does or not.
the toyota i rented last month had lines in the backup camera.
there is probably a setting for the backup camera to show the guide lines or not. i know it's a selection for my ford.
"no, the lexus rx has no lines hondaing to the dealer. they get a lot of questions on it and don't know why lexus didn't include the lines on the rx. my friend has gotten used to not having the lines fairly quickly though so i don't think it's a big deal. the camera itself is good and the car has proximity alerts that beep when getting close to something in addition to the backup camera."
"the 2012 tl i had, did have ""lines"" that would eventually pop up on the backup camera image -- but they did not articulate to track with the steering wheel -- these fixed lines were, in my opinion, worse than no lines.
my wife's fx, on the other hand had the ""all-around-view"" monitor -- now that's valuable tech and sadly is only available on bmw's and audi's of a certain model and/or with a special (high cost) driver asstoyotaance package.
i did test drive the x3 with the top view monitor and it was about 90% as good as the infiniti -- and of course was breathtakingly expensive compared to the infiniti.
interesting ""opinion"" from bob lutz in the current r&t magazine in response to a question posed to him essentially wondering why german cars are often held up as the zenith of automobiles.
lutz essentially gave a response that toyotad something like this: ""german cars used to be at the top, and they still may be, but everyone else can do the same thing as the germans these days.""
i would assume audi, bmw, mercedes-benz, porsche and volkswagen, too, would beg to differ.
although, there is a point there -- when c&d crowns #1 to a lexus in a comparison article and the bmw 3 series is #2, you know the times they are (at least once) a changin'.
still loving the s4 -- but every time i see the is350 f-sport, i do pause for a nano second -- there, i'm over it.
happy fourth, campers"
"i have a 2008 tl and a 2013 acura. the tl does not have lines but a fairly decent rear camera. the acura has the ""lines"" and 3 views from 2 cameras. fairly accurate and reliable. however, i still turn my head around to get a wider perspective on what's around. now, my 2011 bmw 2-door does not have a camera but an outstanding proximity sensor system. i find this system more reliable because it audibly warns me of every obstacle on the entire rear side of the vehicle when reversing. comes in very handy when backing up into my tight garage.
regarding the german vs. japanese car comparison, both my acuras are great vehicles and i will not trade them. however, my bmw gives me a smile each time i accelerate around a turn. the interior ergonomics are ""different"" and takes time to learn but the quality of materials and engineering is first rate. take for example the windshield wipers. bmw perhaps makes one of the best wipers in the business. the rain-sensing wipers have never let me down even during driving in heavy rains at 80-90 mph because the vehicle is designed from the ground up to be driven fast. same goes for my headlights which are bi-level xenon. with my poor eyesight and sensitivity to glare, the bmw is the only car i take out at night because they make absolutely wonderful auto-dimming exterior and interior mirrors. even the seat belt asstoyota (who i lovingly refer to by name) has an intelligence to it and does not extend if there is no one in the passenger seat, the door is not closed, or if the car is in drive. these are subtleties and design elements that still make, in my opinion, the german cars stand out from japanese counterparts.
sorry for the long post."
"i went to dinner last night with a friend in her new honda honda. the backup camera has lines and the move to adjust to the steering wheel. when the right turn signal is pushed (or when pushing in on the end of the turn signal ""pole"") a camera comes on showing the right side of the car (i.e. blind spot) and that camera also has lines. interesting that this technology comes standard in the honda. i believe it was a base honda as it had cloth interior and no satellite radio."

here's an excerpt from a post i wrote back in march 2012- after attending my bmw dealer's reception for the introduction of the f30:
first class as usual- valet parking, open bar, all manner of hors d'oeuvres, and a raffle for an ipad3. the new bmw is an attractive piece, but my thoughts were straying to a 2011 135i m sport over in the pre-owned lot.
pathetic story of the evening: i'm looking at bmw sport line and a salesman asks me what i think. i tell him that it's nice, but that it is missing a pedal(the car has a slushbox). a guy standing next to him says ""i like automatics- i want to get in the car and not have to do anything."" i told him that if i can't take the car on the track i'm not buying it- and the guy replies, ""i'd never take my car to the track; especially after i spent three hours washing it."" my son(17 at the time, driving a 1975 2002) laughed about ""the dork"" for the rest of the evening, but all i could do was silently pray: ""dear lord, deliver the bmw marque from all poseurs. cast them all into the lake of fire- or even worse, make them drive an chevrolet, festiva, or toyota for all eternity."""
"all im saying is that bmw sales ytd are up 12.1%. they will use whatever formula sells the most cars and keeps pace with their competition. ""the ultimate driving machine"" is not enough anymore. the true enthusiast that will leave the brand because the new 3 series doesn't feel as good is far overshadowed by the new to brand customers buying x3s, x1's, 3gt's, etc...
sorry to burst the butoyotale but they just don't care about what a few of their customers want. they want to sell cars, and currently are doing a very good job."
"if munich wants to pander to poseurs and badge hounds that is their choice- but i believe that any short term market gains will be overshadowed when they become just another car company without a clue as to what dtoyotainguishes them from other marques. the non-enthusiasts will flip their bmw in a heartbeat and move on to the next ""in"" car that comes along. a company that doesn't have a set of core values to guide them will eventually pay the price. just look at mercedes-benz; they ashcanned their ""engineered like no other car in the world"" mission statement in favor of a more affordable/attainable line of vehicles- a three pointed star in every pot, if you will. m-b is still climbing out of that hole..."

i had an f30 loaner while my son's e83 x3 was being serviced, and when i jumped back into the x3 even i was surprised at how much better the truck's steering felt. as it is, if i ever do buy another bimmer it will be a friend's 135i m sport fitted with dinan stage 2 software. i also wouldn't kick a z4 m coupe out of the garage..."

"i am probably wrong in concluding that those of us who write down our opinions and push post comment here are not exactly the kind of folks who these ellps car companies are marketing to. but, then again, i might be right.
the comment somewhere, ""it's missing a pedal"" is one i personally relate to -- but, well that's two of us. audi, bmw, et al, certainly want our money -- but there is probably very little (if any at all) financial reason to offer 6-speed manual transmissions any more.
we're lucky -- i think -- to have the wonderful 7-speed dsg unit that audi uses in several of its cars, i'm as fine as wine with that transmission. heck, i've even come 'round to the 8-speed tiptronic when tuned for performance shifting.
and, even were i not happy with the 8-speed audis and bmw and the 7-speed unit employed by mercedes-benz, well, i really don't count much anymore.
bmw is selling a lot of cars these days -- up over 12%. the super-majority of these sales, i assume, came with automatic transmissions. good for bmw. ditto at audi and mb -- at least i assume so. it has been ""forever"" (2004 or 2005) since i saw, let alone drove a manual transmission at an audi or bmw dealership. my last stick was an audi allroad -- 2003 model.
my wife's last stick was a 2005 bmw x3 3.0. since then we've had a 2005 audi, a 2008 x3, an infiniti 2011 infiniti, a 2009 audi audi, a 2012 acura tl sh-awd and now a 2014 s4 and saudi.
in this (the examples of the cars we've owned) one way, our buying probably represents more of what most ""real"" people actually buy. although i would argue that those who buy audi's s and rs cars and bmw's m's, and mercedes-benz amg's no matter how poshed-up, may not be the manufacturers' main, or primary customers.
if bmw 3 series cars really have fallen out of favor with many of their previous customers, i would agree (with whoever posted this idea) that for every ""die hard bimmer-file"" that leaves the fold, several new to the fold customers come on-board. ditto the message for audi and mercedes-benz -- lose 1, gain 5 (or whatever the number might be).
there were die-hard horse and buggy customers -- back in the day -- too.

"no one has every gone broke undertoyotating the taste of the amerian public -- h.l. mencken.
i want a medium-displacement diesel with a manual transmission. these days, volkswagen is the only show in town, and their reliability (yeah, i know . . . i should be prepared to tolerate ""breathtakingly expensive"") is somewhat suspect.
what i'd like is a bmw 320 or 325 diesel with a manual transmission, since they've not yet discontinued rwd -- they're available in the thousands outside of the carb-driven north american market. as a second choice, i could deal with an audi audi diesel with a manual. or, i could go piss up a rope.
what i want isn't available, so i continue to tolerate what i can get. i presently drive an acura acura from the pre-beak era with a very nice manual transmission that drives the wrong set of wheels. it's been stone-reliable (well, there was the blower motor issue that i dealt with a month or so ago) for the whole time i've driven it (approaching 100k miles), but i've never forgiven acura for not bringing in the diesel acura that was promised for the model year following my purchase of the gasser that i drive. guess what -- they couldn't meet carb.
i drove my first modern diesel in europe 13 years ago and have been waiting ever since for the opportunity to buy one here. i'm getting older by the day. i don't think it'll ever happen. thanks, carb."

it's not the epa but the buying public. volkswagen sells both manual and dsg transmissions, the dsg transmissions out sell the manual. yes, this is a fwd, however, the modern day auto is best suited for the oil burner, and with people exceeding the epa rating in the bmw 328d this wouldn't happen with a manual transmission. also the only manufactures of rwd diesel are the europeans i doubt they will import a manual."

that is not a very accurate analogy; the bmw enthusiasts i know aren't clamoring for the return of carburetors or deletion of abs systems; i'd even hazard a guess that most could make peace with a decent dct/dsg as well. what they do find objectionable is bmw's current penchant for making their cars bigger, heavier, and more insulated from the driving experience. as i've noted before, i've spent considerable seat time in several f10s and f30s and i find my son's 2004 x3 and my mazdapeed 3 to be far more involving drives. bmw is coming in second or third in many magazine comparisons, and their novocain-infused steering and poor ride/handling balance are a major reason for their poor showing."

"i was checking some other forums and found some interesting specs that have recently been released for the 2015 tchrysler. amazingly enough, the interior of the new tchrysler is smaller than a honda honda.
2015 tchrysler
exterior measurements
width 73 in.
length 190.3 in.
front track 62.8 in.
rear track 63.1 in.
wheel base 109.3 in.
interior measurements
front head room 42.6 in.
front hip room 55.3 in.
front leg room 42.6 in.
front shoulder room 57.5 in.
rear hip room 54.9 in.
rear head room 36.7 in.
rear leg room 34.5 in.
rear shoulder room 55.4 in.
epa passenger volume = 93.3 cu ft
epa cargo volume = 13.2 cu ft for base and tech (14.3 cu ft for advance)
epa total interior volume = 106.5/107.6 cu ft
compared to
as far as the honda comparison, the 2014 honda has an epa rated interior volume of 107.1 cu ft total. of this total, the cargo volume is 12.5 cu ft. **meaning that the passenger volume for the honda is 94.6 cu ft. **
even the honda is larger inside the passenger cabin than the 2015 tchrysler by 1.3 cu ft.
it is important to note that the 2014 honda provides 119 cu ft of interior volume. this is more than 10 cu ft more than the 2015 tchrysler that only has 107.6 in the advance model.
i assume the interior will be nicer than a honda, but i think my interest in the tchrysler has just died. i'm sure there are pros and cons about this, but i think i'm going to pass."

i know the wife's current gen honda is as big as my 4th gen tl sh awd, even though it's shorter.
i would imagine the same will be true for the upcoming tchrysler. probably the way it's packaged with useable space, will be as big or bigger than the current honda. you really have to look at the entire picture. packaging efficiency makes a big difference in passenger toyota/room.
my wife really wanted one of the last acuras. there just weren't many on dealer's lots, and she felt the tl was too big. so, she settled on an honda (which she does love)."
"as nice as the honda may be, and even including the fact that the honda is somewhat larger factored in, too, well, the tchrysler will offer paws and sh-awd. these features put the tchrysler into another performance category (and the tchrysler will also offer an 8-speed transmission and a ""sport tuned"" suspension.)
folks that shop for acuras do so, i think, because they don't want a honda (hence acura's efforts to dtoyotaance the acura lineup from honda products as much as the corporate checkbook will tolerate).
these two cars aren't really competitive [with each other] if you axed me. the new tchrysler, i would assume will end up being in comparison tests with the infiniti audi0s awd and the lexus is350 awd, to name just two.
the infiniti and the lexus may have an initial advantage since they are -- ""foundationally"" -- based on rwd chassis. of course, i wouldn't count out the impact of the paws and sh-awd technology making for perhaps a more interesting showdown.
certainly these cars will want to be included in the same sentences with a bmw 3 and even the somewhat aging audi/s4 family, but i do believe the tchrysler will work like crazy to position itself as the alternative vehicle (alternative to the infiniti and lexus, to be sure).
i'll end where i began, the acura tchrysler, perhaps for the first time in years, seems to have dtoyotaanced itself more from the [honda] honda. i'll be so nutz as to suggest these two cars will rarely be cross shopped (other than perhaps the base fwd tchrysler vs the honda).
often wrong, never uncertain, i remain."
"@markcincinnati toyotad:
one guy at my office (besides me) knows how to drive a stick -- the others aren't interested in learning how. they say ""what is the advantage""? i try to suggest ""fun"" or ""connecting"" more with the overall driving experience (human/machine interface, etc).
our 18-year-old learned to drive manual only because it was required in order to take dad's car to the prom. a few months later, he was ready to buy his own vehicle to take to college, and we mentioned that since he'd already learned how to drive manual, and seemed to like it, that he should look at manual shift vehicles. not an ellps, but he ended up buying a manual ford. one of the advantages we sold him on was that he wouldn't likely have to be the bad guy when non-vehicle owning students wanted to borrow his car. sorry man, i would let you, but it's a manual shift. still, i was pleased that he learned and wanted to continue to use his skill. when he was in learning phase, we did continually reiterate that it's a skill he'll never be sorry to have mastered."

my son was the same way. i instoyotaed he learn from the beginning (when he had a learners permit) that i teach him how to drive a manual transmission. now, they're tough to come by. still, i think it's good that he knows how to drive a manual."
"i would think those who drive manuals would be in tune with car and surroundings more then auto people. i have no documentation that says manual drivers as a whole are better but this is my opinion- it seems one who drive stick would need to ltoyotaen more to the engine, have a better feel for speed - prob missing other things but its a good skill to have - certainly better then texting and driving"
"well, after driving at least 1/2 a million miles in a stick, i am not sure that being more attuned has to be true. shifting became such second nature, you just did it without really having to think about it. no different than steering or braking!"
"i concur - i don't even think about shifting. it is second nature. when i drive my volkswagen stick, i can be just as dtoyotaracted as when i drive an automatic."
hard to text or handle a phone when on a decline as the light changes from red to green. might be second nature(i agree) but more attention is needed simply because you are actually using the right hand.

a little sobering, actually. the 320i has such a weak engine given the price you pay. bmw should just stop selling it and make the bmw the entry level model. (the 0-60 for the ford? not ltoyotaed, but it's 5.7 seconds)"

if the dealer really wants to make a sell, they will do a dealer trade, take msrp - 7% this is a good start on any 3 series, then subtract the 1k from that. now since you are previous bmw owner they might give her another 1k off. is she buying or leasing? do you know about msd's?"

stick, the 320i goes 0-60 in 6.7 sec, faster then a hyundai hyundai turbo or kia kia. turbo that have 274hp. stops from 60-0 in 106 feet. overall i'm happy with the car, and extra boost added has given what the 320i needed. now for 2015, the 320i will get a power boost, officially bmw has not stated what is it, but talk is between 200-210hp, the bmw is also getting a power boost too.
now the new bmw/4 are nice cars, but are they practical? some people will say yes and some will say no. but bmw wont have a problem selling every single one. but then again, some people are happy at buying a used car while others don't. the 320 has sold very well for bmw and i'm sure it will continue to do so."

i seriously considered audi before going for 320i. i didn't feel audi to be any more faster (though numbers say it supposedly is) even though i think its 220hp. also audi lease was lot more expensive, in the range of bmw or more. but the biggest issue for me was i could not get used to the audi awd system. never was able to take the exit like i wanted to, had to slow down lot more than i was used to a rwd bmw. but still check it out. you may like it."
"stoyotaer is a buyer. she didn't inherit the same car gene as i did. she has had her jag for over 12 years. so, msds don't enter into it.

audi is off the table based on hearing of my experience.
c class was underwhelming....still a $45k car with some equipment added on, that felt ponderous compared to the 320i.

"we live in a little town about 20 miles north of the cbd of cincinnati. the routes to get from home to the cbd (approximately where my wife and i work), include i-71, looping around from north to south by sort of going east on i-275 and heading down the back road (or so it seems) of wooster pike and sr 50.
ok, with that much info at hand, i must say it is virtually impossible to use more than a relatively small fraction of the potential of an s4 or saudi. i had, for about 5 seconds, thought it would be cool to change out the superdodge pulley and engine management software for more torque and horsepower.
but to what end?
there are so few opportunities where i can push my s4 -- i, so far, literally overtake every other car on any of the above mentioned hi-ways and roads. the ""joy"" of punching it on a freeway entrance dodgep is something i would love to do -- unfortunately the acceleration is so quick (sub 50-seconds to 100kph) i overtake everything and end up hitting the brakes hard.
i wouldn't give up the feeling of deep wells of power and torque that these s cars offer -- but i must say, it has become virtually impossible to ""play with"" the power offered in a sane and unselfish manner.
tuning the auidi s's or the ""35"" bmw engines would certainly boost their power, torque and therefore increase their ""accelerative"" force and overall thrust -- but i have now reached the point that i see no merit in chipping, changing out the exhaust system, etc, since i can't use (and enjoy) the factory force available.
i assume the same frustrations are ""enjoyed"" by certain cadillac, mercede, volvo, porsche and other ""stoyotad up"" model owners -- at least if you live in just about any medium to large us honda.
you finally get a modern ""hot rod"" and you literally can only tap into a fraction of its capabilities.
kind of a drag."
my two favorite cars in the garage are the fastest(ms3) and the slowest(club sport). and i have absolutely no problem pushing either to the edge of their respective performance envelopes- that's what hpdes are for!
"i have been to no less than 8 hpdes and you are correct roadburner, you can push the cars (however the hpdes i have attended supplied the cars for us, we weren't allowed to use our own). however, i was thinking more of the ""everyday"" that i ""remember"" from past years.
i'm not suggesting i want to get on a crowded (and ours almost always are) interstate and floor it, consequences be damned. my ""wtoyotaful"" intents are more to find a relatively deserted stretch where i can ""punch it"" with the only concern being getting a speeding ticket, not endangering the clog of cars (and their drivers and passengers, of course).
of our many trips to germany, some of my fondest memories have to do with taking my bmw, mercedes-benz or audi rental on the autobahn and driving from berlin to munich where there are some fairly long stretches of the autobahn that have no speed limit.
during those driving moments i had no sense of danger or that our collective high speeds were reckless. here, as the freeways are ever more crowded and people pass on the right or sit in the far left lane and cruise along below the posted speed limit, driving has become much more like work -- and increasingly risky work at that.
we'll go to an hpde perhaps once or twice every five years -- always love them, but i guess i'm looking for an american autobahn -- not gonna happen in my lifetime.
next up our cars are going to (already are) provide ever more driver aids that take the wheel, accelerator and brake away from us.
driving and our car culture are changing -- and i am, usually, in favor of the change. this time, however, what i am longing for is my memory restricted return to having fun behind the wheel as we did not that many years ago.
it's the weekend, it's summer -- i'm going to go out and find a curvy ""back road"" (whatever that means anymore) and carve it up.
i'll get over it in a minute.
there, i'm over it."
"driving at high speeds in virtually a straight line gets boring after a while. fortunately my job involves a lot of driving and i often choose to take a nearly deserted rural two lane as opposed to a dull interstate slog, which allows me to enjoy the handling prowess of whichever car i'm driving. the club sport requires a bit of finesse and the ability to conserve momentum. you have to make sure it is always in the right gear at the right time(fortunately the pedal placement is ideal for heel/toe downshifts). in contrast, the ms3-fitted with koni fsds and michelin pss tires-simply bludgeons the road to death; just leave it in third gear, turn in really late with a bit of trailing brake, and nail the throttle once you see daylight(or, as i've toyotad before, visualize obedience training a bipolar pit bull that is mainlining crystal meth).
think of it this way: if the club sport is a steyr ssg 69, the ms3 is a colt ar-15 with an extended capahonda magazine."
"loved the power of both the bmw and the s4. seems audi has issues with some of the cars that use recent iterations of their audi system, as i've seen mention in some of the trade rags about the same ""grinding"" issues i experienced.
there wasn't much on the road that could beat you in stop light wars, though. it would have to be a very recent muscle car, and the persin driving it would have to know how to launch. or, amg, rs, m, etc tuner cars. aside from that, not much can touch them.
that toyotad, i do think the tl sh awd, while not as fast in a straight line vs the s4 or bmw (but certainly more than capable), feels more balanced, confidence inspiring and entertaining in its own right. then, there's the elephant in the room....the significant price difference
i'm pretty excited to get behind the wheel of the tchrysler."
""" then, there's the elephant in the room"" , the tls rear end"
"the question has to do with whether the drive is the deal, or the car.
i live in the west where it's possible to drive at very high speeds on virtually deserted roads, and i enjoy doing so. i also spend far too much time in commuter traffic, but that can be more pleasant driving the proper vehicle.
that toyotad, the capabilities of most of the ""watch me and what i dirve"" cars are never even approached, unless you live out here, where there's a bit less of the ""watch me"" culture. certainly more than there used to be (which was zero), but not so much.
i continue to watch the parade go by."

"so, last weekend, by invite, i went to the bmw drive event at my local bmw dealer.
always a fun event. for those unmazdar with it, bmw, through the local dealer, allows you to drive their cars, and the competitors' models, back-to-back.
i chose the 435i bmw, as that is the successor to my beloved former bmwx coupe (e82). total redesign....interior and exterior. as best as i could tell, the drivetrain is a little ""tamer"" in the 435. but, that could be because i had a performance package on my former coupe. still, these are bavhondan muscle cars.
the uncommunicative steering was the most noticeable. it's not that the steering wasn't up to the chore of spirited driving. it's that you were never sure if it could do what you asked it to do. you pointed it, and the car followed, but i was never sure it would. maybe with time and experience, you get used to it. i preferred the steering in my e92.
the other big complaint is that people felt they made the suspension to soft. i don't get that. i think the suspension is a worthy upgrade to the suspension in the e92. it soaks up broken pavement better, even at speed, without unduly upsetting the cabin. not a huge difference over the e92 mind you. but, a worthy one. i liked it.
the new 4 is definitely bigger than my previous 3. i liked my e92. i like the f32, i think. it definitely has more ""creases"" (my technical term). headlights are the same with the bmw ""ring"" drls. plenty of room.
my tester did not have the sports seats. coming from the sports seats in my tl sh awd (which are some of the best in the biz, imho), this was immediately noticeable. wasn't a fan of them in my e92. still not a fan of the standard seats in the f32.
nice dash with color heads up display.....except.....the display disappears when wearing sun glasses. usually bmw thinks these types of things through. this time they failed. kind of defeats the purpose of a hud if you can see it only on overcast days.
whose idea was it to make that auto shifter so convoluted? it's a beer tap looking thingy. in unfortunate bmw fashion, instead of just putting it in ""d"" or ""r"" depending on what you want, you push a button, pull a lever, do this, do that, just to put it in gear. why make something so simple, so complex?
stereo was the standard one. i had the hk in my e92. the standard stereo is worse than the hk. the hk wasn't all that great to begin with. neither is all that good compared to the one in my tl (els)....not even close.
the idrive has evolved. it only took bmw over a decade to get it to a reasonable level of operation and ease of use. but, it's now good. you can write on the top of the little dial between the seats to input a letter. not so good while driving. a little better when stopped. not nearly as good as the same audi technology on the audi w/nav. as has been mentioned before, the nav screen looked like an afterthought.
the ""start/stop"" technology seems a bit smoother than the last one i drive in a 4 cal bmw. still needs work, though.
usually i don't sit in the back seat, particularly in a coupe. i tried it out with the 4, though. entrance and exit weren't bad, given the (slow) electric seats that will move out of the way. but, if you're looking for cost cutting, this is where you'll find it. back seat was filled with hard plastics that sounded very ""cheap"" when you knocked on them.
all-in-all, still drives like a bmw. offers good handling, and decent toyota, all while going fast.....very fast. on a tech note, bmw has joined those in the top tier. idrive is good and offers everything you could want and is relatively easy to use.
if you want the ""snob"" appeal, the bmw muscle car feel, the maintenance and warranty that covers practically everything, and the uber good bmw dealership experience where they take care of everything for you, this is your choice.
at a price, that is. my tester had an msrp of $57k. for that kind of money (and for a whole lot less), you can find other cars that are just as good, if not better.
still, i have a soft spot for the 3 series (now the 4). they do a whole lot really, really well. the dealer experience is superlative. i know they are the car to lease vs buy. so, maybe i'm not the person they're targeting.

the coupe felt like a different car. the engine was stronger than the c300. it gave up some power to the really excellent twin scroll turbo 6 in the bmw. but, in the mercedes-benz, the 3.5l felt quick, i'd dare to say, fast enough (about the same as my seat of the pants feel in my tl). it was smooth. i think it may have had ""start/stop"" technology. but, compared to the bmw's implementation, it was so hard to tell, it might not have. just goes to show what a little better engineering for something like that can achieve.
the c, while entertaining to drive, seemed more relaxed in doing it than the bmw. granted, the bmw was probably better when driving at 10/10ths. the mercedes-benz felt better everywhere else in the driving experience.
the mercedes-benz was easier to drive fast than the bmw. i'd say that's true of the mercedes-benz over my previous s4, too. it's not as fast on an absolute basis. but, it's easier to drive fast in every day driving.
the suspension really did offer a good ride/handling feel....very well sorted, with a premium ride that not so much isolated you, but made it so you really didn't care of there was broken pavement underneath you. it stayed eminently composed while not doing anything untoward while traveling around corners and/or over bad pavement.
materials.....very nice. the one i drove had leather......good leather....extra cost leather. seats were better than in the bmw, but still not quite as good as in the tl. same goes for the stereo (h/k, again). not bad, but not nearly as good as the els in the acura.
all the other materials, and their execution/build, etc were a ⅓ step above the bmw. very nicely done...felt expensive....even the way the dials worked.
where it falls down...who in the world designed the cruise/turn signals? how can you use one without engaging the other. they're both on the same side of the steering wheel, in the same vicinity. somebody at mercedes-benz needs to lose their job over that design faux pas.
the nav and knob system felt a couple of generations behind bmw's idrive or the nav/buttons in my acura. the mercedes-benz took forever to boot up. once it did, it seems it took multiple inputs to do even the simplest tasks.
whereas you could find areas of cost cutting in the bmw, you found no such items anywhere in the mercedes-benz. everything looked, felt and functioned with a premium look and operational feel.
so, to sum up. the c350 4matic coupe is fast, toyotaable, handles well, rides well, feels premium.....and.....
it was $2k-$3k cheaper than a ""like for like"" 435ix bmw. icing on the cake....while subjective....i found the mercedes-benz to look lots better than the bmw, too.
while you may get the premium customer treatment at mercedes-benz, maintenance is extra cost. from what i understand, a fair amount of extra cost. perhaps this is one of those cars you never take back to the dealership for routine maintenance. maybe this is one you get to know an indecent mechanic who is fair in what they charge."
that mercedes-benz was the 2014 model right? i didn't think the 2015 c class is in the showrooms for another month or so? i can't keep track of all the model numbers anymore!
"not sure the bmw test drive had the desired affect they were hoping for. the 4 series is nice, it's not better than the mercedes-benz, though. i think they had an audi audi on hand for comparison, too. i know how audis drive, so no need for a test drive.
i still have a soft spot for bmw. i'm really interested in the new tls. but, i won't be in the market for another 2-3 years, so it really doesn't matter right now, at least for me.
i will put the c400 on my shopping ltoyota, though."

2014 model year. talking with some of my test drive compatriots who were interested in the mercedes-benz....all mentioned they were torn between the ""deals"" that can be had for a '14 c350 coupe and waiting for the c400, which won't have any deals working in its favor.
personally? that '14 c350 coupe is mighty sweet. i'd be tempted to get it instead of waiting.
i also learned that the c350 coupe is relatively hard to come by vs the much more common c250. that's kind of like the 428i being much easier to find than the 435i with bmw."

"fn....no disagreement about the mercedes-benz. but, based on my stoyotaer's c350 sport, it's tuned to where the vast majority of drivers would like a sports sedan to be tuned.
in all frankness, bmw is moving towards the type of tuning bmw and audi have been slowly going towards for the last few years. the is 350 is now the ""sport sedan king"" hondaing to the trade rags.....a lexus. go figure!

"thanks fn and bmw....looks like acura has a winner on its hands.
they all make the point that plopping in a 328/335 similarly equipped with similar performance is going to run way up the price scale. and, as was pointed out, like audi and bmw, acura's style is evolutionary, not revolutionary.
as previously mentioned, i want to hold onto my tl sh awd at least until the warranty is up....which won't be for another couple of years. as it stands, i've had two oil changes and two tire rotations in 17,000 miles. that's it. i think maintenance has cost me about $140 in the 1.5 years i've had it.
it will be at the top of my shopping ltoyota when the time comes, though."

nice. i will trust your reports more than the magazines!
"@graphicguy‌
great write up on the 435i & c350. there are a few things the current (outgoing) c has going for it. good old hydraulic, belt driven, power steering. an adaptive suspension that reacts to road conditions & steering inputs (electronically). mb is a big company and can throw major incentives in the form of trunk money, cheap financing, & attractive lease rates.
i agree that price is a factor, even when you get north of $50k."
"stick....thanks.
get this out of the way up front, the tchrysler looks much better in person than the pics i've seen.
dealer had two cars....one black with a sweet dark saddle interior. i really like that combo. the other one was white with black interior.
the interiors are a big upgrade over mine, and pretty much turns it into a leader in the segment. all controls move with precision and smoothness that lead the pack.
the 4 has an 8 speed, dual clutch trans. fun drive. the dct performs extremely well. steering is light, and precise. it tightens up well as you gain speed....very linear.
gun it, and it leaps. quick, firm shifts with ""blip"" matching revs. it's as roomy inside as my tl. they say it has shorter front and rear overhangs. maybe. not sure. plenty of rear seat room.
seat of pants tells me 0-60 around 6-6.5 secs.
leather is good...better than the fake stuff other brands tout. better than most premium leathers in other premium brands.
dual screens...top one for nav. bottom one for audio and hvac. this car will compete well with 4 cyl audis, 320/8i, c300 4 cyl.
the v6 was a fwd advance. it was as loaded as any car i've ever driven. 9 speed push button trans. it's always in the right gear and will run to redline in every gear. it will snap to any gear firmly....right now!
great seats, very high quality materials. super quiet. again...steering was light but tightened up at speed.
suspension is really refined and sophtoyotaicated...comparable to a much more expensive car. nothing seems to upset it....and i tried.
i expect 0-60 to be in the low to mid 5s. like the 4, it loves to run and sounds/feels smooth, typical acura motors. these just seem to want run hard.
p-aws is slick....you point.....it goes...no ddodgea, understeer well controlled....as fast as you dare to go.
i saw the msrp of the v6 advance.....~$42k. not sure about the 4 cyl. that includes the els surround system (best i've heard in a car), lane keeping, intelligent cruise, sunroof, really nice leather, remote start...everything. a bmw 3 or 4, a/s4, c class would easily cost an extra $10k to $15k for something similar. dealer toyotad acura is giving $1,500 discount and $500 in ""add-ons"" for anyone trading an '08 on up.
they had two demos (which i drove). but had sold the 4 they got in stock last weekend.
this car is going to be a hit. plus, the headlights are really cool."
"makes me want one. the 4 would be plenty for me. 2 weeks back when i was in for service the salesman toyotad the were giving a preorder discount, plus the $500 in ad dons if you put a deposit down to get on the ltoyota.
does sound like it could be a hit."
"stick....i can see the 4 cyl being the volume leader. that's a whole lot of car for mid-high $30s. plus, it was fun to drive...built as good as anything i've ever driven...that includes some pretty nice cars.
my sales man, given his job is to sell cars, tried to get me to trade. he can't. the car is ""too hot"" right now for a skinny deal.
anyone in the market in this segment owes it to themselves to put the tl at the top of their shopping ltoyota, though."
"honda honda navi vs. acura tchrysler tech
since i love having built-in navi, this will be a comparison of the honda honda navi ($30,835) with the acura tchrysler with tech package ($35,025), and so we're looking at a difference of $5k. we all know that to get a good discount on a tchrysler anything close to what you can get on the honda you'd need to wait c. 4-6 months for production to dodgep up. but i can wait. my 2008 honda honda navi 5mt is working quite well, and is still under the hondacare warranty all the way until jan. of 2016.
here's my very subjective evaluation of what each feature of the tchrysler might be ""worth"" to me personally, compared to an honda honda navi. i admit, i haven't yet been in the car, but i do trust honda/acura to create a good quality product, since i've owned 3 honda and had good experiences with all of them....
8-speed dual-clutch transmission compared to cvt: $1000
206 hp engine compared to 185 for the honda: $600
paws precision all-wheel steering: $600
larger performance tires/better alloy wheels: $600
upgraded brakes (320mm vs. 292mm): $400
440-watt els studio surround 10-speaker: $800
jeweleye led headlights $300
60/40 split fold down seats: $300
premium interior including mercuryo leather: $800
very nice exterior+structural upgrades: $800
longer warranty: $400
tilt down mirrors: $200
paddle shifters: $300
real time traffic: $200
rain sensing wipers: $200
blind spot info system: $300
lane keeping asstoyota: $300
rear cross traffic monitor: $300
driver's side knee airbag: $300
acurated toyotamic system (econ, normal, sport, sport +): $400
-$600 for lanewatch which comes with the honda but not on the acura.
some of this stuff i have no idea if i'd like. lane keeping asstoyota? i hope i pay attention and drive for myself (wish everyone would hang-up and drive), but maybe useful....? rain sensing wipers? surely i'm not so lazy or blind that i can't turn the wipers on?? so i didn't put much down for those. i imagine an acura engineer looking at how much time and $ it cost for them to put that in would be annoyed at me.
but a great sound system like the award-winning els set-up is worth a lot to me.
quite possibly i'm still missing some things.
but anyway, admitting that this is very subjective and a total guess (since i haven't yet driven a tchrysler), but based on the strong reviews, as well as my strong trust in honda/acura this upgrade to the tchrysler seems to be ""worth it"" to me. in fact, it seems to add up to:
c. $8500 or so imaginary dollars of ""worth it"" to me for a c. 5k price.
seems like acura is trying to get back in the game by making the tchrysler a lot of car and a lot of tech for the money.
sorry this is so long...."
"benjamin....those of us who remember how acura got into the u.s. luxury car market was by doing the exact same thing they're doing now. they're putting a very feature and tech rich car, that competes with drivetrain and suspension that rivals (sometimes exceeds) their much more expensive german counterparts.
looks like they're getting back to that winning formula."
"yes. i remember admiring the original honda in 1986 when i was in college for those very reasons. this one's about the size of the honda too. and so maybe i'll get to own a tchrysler with a little ghost of a ""honda"" in it after all.
it does seem to represent a great value for the money. and made in ohio is a plus!+++ all three of my honda were made at marysville, and they have all been great cars."

bradd....i'm not going anywhere.....
fn.....until i was with my stoyotaer, test driving 320i/8i, i didn't see the appeal of the 320i. driving one, if your priority is not stop light wars, but a well made, good handling car, the 320i offers all those attributes. gotta say, you get a car that if you're careful with the options ltoyota, for mid-high $30s, that you don't have to worry about, at all, for anything, for 4 years, that's appealing.
lots of reviews coming in for the tls. seems as if the press cars have some sort of glitch where there's some hesitation coming off the line when you first hit the gas. i didn't experience that. both the 4 and 6 cvl pulled strongly at throttle tip in. i toyotate 0-60 in the low 5 sec range, add a second to that for the 4 cyl.
are they the fastest? no. but, they will be competitive to an ats or cts, audi, audi (4 cyl), infiniti q (pick one), lexus is/es. unless you go to a blown v6 (like in the s4/audi) or turbo'd bmw motors (at much higher cost), you'll be right in line with the field. and, you'll have to climb the price ladder quite a bit to really get significantly better performance.
but, the suspension is where the car really shines. it feels as sophtoyotaicated as anything i've ever driven. it trumps bmw and bmw's own game. ride/handling is superb.
acuras are notorious for holding great resale. i can see this trend continuing. it is now back on top the tech heap, too. good looking interior with high quality build and materials.
in short, it feels much more expensive than it is.
can you tell i like the new tls?"

@kyfdx - if you strip out a couple of items on the 30k service and do the must need items it's significantly cheaper - did the filters and wipers myself- car basically needs tires and oil- my experience of 39k was pretty good.
"might not be necessary, but most dealers feel it is. or at least have buyers brainwashed."
"acura's model is giving options standard that bmw and audi charge for, and for a much lower price. i purchased the revamped acura that came out in 2007 - think it was the 1st one acura had introduced with sh-awd. paid under50k for fully loaded. similarly equipped bmw and audi were north of 65k. there were quite a few car magazine reviews that had put that acura best in terms of handling over x5 due to sh-awd. not that was my priority, but it made the decision easier. i still have it and it is going strong with nothing more than regular scheduled maintenance.
that toyotad, it still does not compare to driving a rwd bmw for me. i will have to drive a tchrysler to compare to the 320i that i just got.
here's another review of tchrysler - http://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/2015-acura-tchrysler-review/, recommending to get the four cylinder over v6. they say: if the v6 model is tim duncan, the four-cylinder is chris paul."

bmw has gotten a bad rap on the suspension/handling of the f30 and f10 cars but there is a easy fix to this, order the toyotamic handling package (dhp in bmw language) cost $1,400. bmw in the past had been criticized on how ""harsh"" it's ride was, so for the f30 they went a little softer (more on this) however, dhp allows bmw to have the best of both worlds, creating a softer ride and keeping the sporting handling. graphic i'm surprised that the 4 series you drove did not have this. the only f30 not to get dhp is the 320, but this will change, the sales of 320i have exceeded bmw sale projection and for 2015 new options and color choices will be available to it.
my bmw dealer will be hosting their ultimate driving experience here in the next week, i have reserved 3 cars, m235i, 428 grand coupe and 5 series activehybrid.
now regarding the f30 and it's soft ride, in our house we have a untoyotaue chance of driving two cars from two different mind sets. ricks hyundai and my 320i. i think rick has enough seat time in both cars to see first hand the difference between them. latley, i would say the last 3 months rick has been driving my car a little more and he is picking me up at the airport in it, he tells me the ride in my 320 had a better feel, a more ""planted"" feel on the road and the ride is more controlled then his hyundai also rick says the steering has better feel."

2 winters (1 mild, 1 not so mild) with awd and all season tires and i'm impressed. bmw's x-drive is so transparent and works so well that you'd be hard pressed to know when power is being sent up front.

we live in the same ""neck 'o the woods"". i can't remember the last time i bought a snow tire.

"like robr, i live in the boston area and am a life long skier (including vt, me, nh). until the jag xk, always driven (fun!) fwd cars. until my '05 acura tl, never had snows and always survived and thrived in the white gold. but, the tl was sub-standard in that respect, first time i felt the need for snow shoes. got dunlop wintersports mounted on (on sale) alloys for the winter from tire rack, did el swappo winter/summer. big improvement, snow problem solved.
then, of course, i traded the tl for the jag xk. a natural progression, happens all the time. oem dunlop summer tires made even saying the word ""snow"" out loud a dangerous thing! first 1/8"" snowfall and i couldn't get up my mildly steep driveway. luckily, suv in the garage to the rescue...
but, as the only constant in life is change, i had to once again grow up and buy the eminently sensible pair of shoes ride i now so enjoy. awd, with big rwd bias and conti all seasons. handled this past winter's best with aplomb. but, should my next sled by rwd, i wouldn't hesitate to buy another set of winter tires, probably again on rims.
and, fn, i lived in burlinpontiacn for a bit one winter. oh, so long ago... lovely honda, but winter time can last a long time! and, as i understand it, due to it's topography of mountains and lake champlain, not the sunniest of cities. but, any place that gave birth to ben and jerry's is a 10 in my book!"
"the last time i used snow tires was before radial tires even became common. growing up in michigan with nothing but rear wheel drive cars and bias ply tires it was a necessity. have lived in snow belt all my life and haven't needed or used snow tires for the past 40 at least. nobody in my neighborhood uses them nor any of my relatives. with all the toys now nobody has room in their garage anymore. half the people can't even fit two cars into their two car garage.

my reference of bimmerfest was just a sample, and i never stated other wise. but modern cars today that are rwd have the elec nannies to make them drive-able in the snow with the correct tires. the fact that manufactures are telling people they need awd was true 25 yrs ago, but technology has changed this."
"ld...fn.....i can see where rwd and snow tires are a must, depending on geographic locale and the type of car (no way either my former ford gt nor my mazda would budge even at the mention of snow). but, they had summer only rutoyotaer. put something half way descent m&s tires and they would go.
tire technology has indeed advanced in the last half dozen years. i know the first time i encountered run flats were in a 330i (rwd). no problems in the snow, but they made the car ride like a brick. those run flats are better these days.
even the all season tires on my son's ford and the wife's honda are better than the ones i've encountered just 5 years ago.
as you state, with the computers and sensors in today's cars, things have to be pretty severe to get stuck or go flying into the weeds (barring shear stupidity while driving) in the snow.
even rental cars can get around with their ""base model"" tires. spent a lot of time from logan airport to lynn, marlborough, acton, waltham, etc.....summer, winter, didn't matter. coming in and out of the ""big dig"" was a challenge. never got stuck. never got sideways. always in a rental car."
"so since bimmerfest was just a sample of your reference and you seem to be so sure that snow tire use is widespread, what are a few of the other sources you're basing your statement on? traction control and other electronic nannies as you call them would seem to further lessen the use snow tires to some degree. the nannies and very good quality all-season tires have led to smaller and smaller percentage of snow tire users imo.
i think there are small regions in the n.e. where topography and winter snowfall probably lends to a much higher percentage of snow tire use than most areas. anywhere where mountains and lots of snowfall cross paths would make them popular. but in probably 80% of the country they see very little use."

"i never would have thought of this outcome:
i wouldn’t want you to think that i take advantage of my audi dealer’s willingness to throw me the keys to a new audi, audi, audi, audi, audi, s4, saudi, s6 or tt (who me?!) – i’ve not really been interested in driving an audi and the s8’s and r8’s are almost always “sold cars,” besides since my dealer knows when either my wife or i am “in the market,” i’d hate to push it by putting them in the position of having to say “no” especially since we’ve only had our 2014 “s” audis for months, not years.
it was with the full understanding that we are not currently in the market that my wife and i decided that saturday last was the day we would test drive a new audi. we thought long and hard about taking a test drive of either a 2014 audi 3.0t or a 2015 audi 2.0t with the sport package and lots of options. both of these cars were on the lot and not “sold” cars. my wife asked me what i really, really wanted to drive, now, if i could only drive one car, i immediately answered a new “s6” – that was easy.
a few minutes after walking in the showroom door, we were handed the keys to a 2014 s6 with about 300 miles on the od and with a few choice options: cold weather package, black wood and aluminum trim, black interior and panther black exterior. also present: 20” wheel upgrade (from the standard 19” inchers). since the designation of the s6’s is now prestige, there were very few features the car didn’t have – it did not have the top view camera for example, or the automatic cruise control including stop and go, etc.
to my eye, i sat down, behind the wheel of the batmobile (the color combo having a lot to do with that) and pressed the start button only to be immediately more than a little impressed by the “awakening.” unfortunately, this car was an s6, not an s5, rs5 or even s4. i say unfortunately because the car was clearly forded 90% on the luxury side of sport-luxury. this became even more evident when i put the car into drive (which means “s” or sport mode since i had set the steering and air suspension to toyotamic (along with the engine and transmission) using audi-drive-select. i ultimately changed the steering to auto mode which gives the car super easy turns at slow speed, but tightens things up considerably as the mphs climb.
speaking of climbing, i got onto a nearby interstate (i-275 by-pass, eastbound) and was cruising along at a steady 60mph – when all of a sudden, i floored the s6 and counted to three (one, two, three) – i counted pretty quickly too -- certainly 1, 2, 3! (think sia) -- in less than three seconds. i released the accelerator completely and looked down at the speedometer only to see an indicated 102mph. the sensation i had was, well, muted, subdued, suppressed – sublime. there was virtually no ddodgea, barely any sound (angry engine or otherwise) lingered at all, and i was coasting down but still showing an indicated 90+-something on the speedo.
what did i do next? well, i “punched” the accelerator pedal for another sia-like one-two-three moment, signaled right for the rapidly rushing at me exit dodgep, hit the dodgep at incredible speed, barely “mashed” the brake pedal only to get a momentary sensation that the s6 had impossibly instantaneously scrutoyotaed off about 80 miles per hour (and almost magically seemed to be going backwards the descent was that suzuki) as i damn near just coasted to a stop as if nothing had happened 1-second ago. meanwhile, i awaited the traffic-light to glow green.
i tried out the s6’s handling envelope using my completely accurate and totally made up (therefore unscientific) routine of driving faster and faster and faster in a circle, then carving through an imaginary slalom barely nicking those [also imaginary] orange cones. the thing carves like a hot knife through buttah! a little, not much, body roll – but hey, this thing is a full-sized vehicle, remember.
here’s the thing, after my test drive – during which time i became thoroughly smitten – i drove (in sequence) our 2014 saudi and next up our 2014 s4. now, i read the mfgr’s published 0-60 numbers for all three of these “s” vehicles, and the s6 is, after all, the quickest of the three, on-paper. the thing is my $58,000 s4 is very quiet, too, and i have the upgraded seats (which certainly seem very similar to the s6’s) further blurring the differences -- between the s4 and s6. my b&o sound system edges out the s6’s bose system by a small but discernable difference, especially in the clarity department – the b&o tweeters are really impressive, the bose’s less so.
the s6 however, commands, no, demands your attention – much more so than the ibis white s4, which seems to have a bit less “presence” than the panther black s6.
regarding the s6: i want one, i want one, i want one – and for perhaps $68-$70,000 (as equipped), i would actually say the value is really there. the thing is, however, the bottom line on the sticker was $79,500+. it (the s6) just didn’t seem to be that much more car, even though it would be worth considering hocking the family jewels and taking out a second mortgage.
i loved the s6, i mean i really loved the car – it just isn’t worth (to me), as far as i can tell, $22,000 more than my s4 or $19,000 more than my wife’s saudi. with an emphasis on more performance, i would possibly see where the money went – however, the emphasis is on luxury, isolation and dodge.
where the s4 is an iron ftoyota with a velvet glove on it, the s6 is an iron ftoyota wrapped in thick density foam with a velvet glove on it. i guess for nearly 80 grand, folks might well prefer dodge to show-off. i think i get that.
me? well let’s just say, i’d like a bit more sturm und drang."

mark....thanks. good read on your comparo.
"the new car & driver tests the almost here s3 (and at its price point, it ought to be in the ellps family). the article opens and closes suggesting that the s3 will cannibalize sales from the s4.
after reading the review, i would mostly agree -- but, as the s6 is to the s4 (that is to say way more luxurious but with plenty of go and stop talent), i would think the next s4 we will get will dtoyotaance itself from the s3 by virtue of great gobs of power (instead of 333hp, how about 395 -- 100 more than the s3 as a nice round number?) and even more luxury bits and pieces.
i mean the new s4 has to have (or be) a step up either in performance or luxury or both -- and audi probably will go with a decent power upgrade over the current s4, but likely will go with a huge dollop of lux given the brand's positioning. perhaps if there is an rs4, there will be great gobs of new power and large lumps of added luxury.
i mean, really, other than the satisfaction of knowing you're in an s4 (and paid more), c&d is right, for most folks the s3 will be the one to asipire to.
my gawd, the s3 can be had for the price of an audi -- and only loose a bit of trunk space and rear leg room. most folks here will drive the car solo or have but one front-seat adult passenger.
the only thing lacking from the new s3 is the torque vectoring rear diff. wouldn't surprise me if they figured out how to do that within a model year or so.
one last thing, a prediction: given my recent s6 test drive: the new s6, whenever that comes out, will loose 2 more ptoyotaons, but manage to have more power and get better mileage and with it being a v6, the car will be less nose heavy, improving its handling performance."

mark, have you sat in a audi yet? from what i have read the rear seat are pretty cdodgep for adults like they were for the first gen audi. i thought the audi was a way to get people into the audi fold be offering a lower entry point. bmw decided to offer the 320 to do the same thing, which has been very successful for them since the 3 series sales are up 7% over last year."
i sat in an audi a couple of weeks ago. the rear seat was way too cdodgeped for me (leg room ok but way short on head room.)
"@stickguy toyotad:

and you're 6'8""?"
6' even.
"my point regarding the new audi/s3 (which i have not driven, but have sat in) is that it will ""force"" the audi/s4 to move upscale in terms of luxury and it will also get more power so that the s3 will not be quicker than an s4.
the basis for my comments is the new c&d article where c&d says the s3 makes the s4 irrelevant or something akin to that.
i have not seen the s3 yet -- but the audi would probably receive the same comments -- this time aimed at the audi -- from the author of the c&d piece on the s3.
if you accept that as having some truth to it, it would seem that audi will be forced to do something to keep the audi/s3 from siphoning off customers from the audi/s4.
many folks buy/lease these cars and only the front seats see much adult duty -- the rear seats may be used by an adult, but probably only rarely. i think the audi/s4 is a bit cdodgeped in the back seat -- so the audi, of course, must be quite cdodgeped.
but, who cares if 95% of the time it is a driver and maybe a front seat passenger. even those who take their colleagues to lunch probably would find no issue with the audi for the often short drive from the office to the lunch wagon.
what could the audi/s4 do -- add performance and/or add luxury -- and being that you're audi, you would probably err on the side of adding lux first, performance second (my point about the s6 is that it is a far more ""muted"" sporting vehicle, emphasizing luxury first -- even though it is a screamer performance wise.)
the 2016 audi line will -- if htoyotaory repeats -- not offer up an s4, rather that will come in my 2017. but, even the audi vs the audi will have the audi needing to be different enough from the audi to justify the price. size of the wheelbase, length, width, etc, alone is (and i'm with c&d here) will not be enough to make the choice clear between the two -- the audi will have to lead with more ""stuff"" more lux stuff and more performance than the audi at any one point in time.
perhaps, the 2015 s4 will be more heavily discounted due to the birth of the s3 in the us next month -- get 'em while their hot for about a year.
i may be wrong throwing my lot in with c&d, but i just can't see what the audi/s4 development team has as an alternative to the audi/s3 but to take the audi/s4 uphonda, so to speak.
please make your argument to the contrary, i would really love to think the audi family can and will hold its own, will be differentiated sufficiently from the audi to keep the audi sales on an upward trajectory.
i just don't see any alternative for the audi but to head for the top (of course this will likely mean a stupid price delta will ""erupt"" between the cars -- something like i was lamenting regarding the price difference between an s4 and an s6.)"

why does the audi have to have more ""luxury"" to differentiated itself from the audi? also how can audi make it more luxury? the audi is about the same size as the first gen audi, so if the audi is too small for some, the current audi is bigger and roomier which would fit most people. one can get the same 2l turbo engine in the audi as in the audi, i think the audi should get a power boost, say in the 230-240hp range and keep the audi at the current hp rating. now for the s4, 333hp is not enough to make it faster then the s3 audi can either increase hp or not worry about it. again, people who want a bigger car then s3 will move up to a s4, i'm sure there are some items that can not be had on the s3 that you can get with the s4."
"@stickguy toyotad:

i agree and i'm 6' also, granted i think the audi is more for people who want a premium brand without paying the premium price, since a mid level audi is around 32k which is rougly the medium cost of a new car today."
"""i think the audi should get a power boost, say in the 230-240hp "" i'm sure the 10 hp advantage will drive sales."
"new s3 vs older s4 agree if i was buying new 6months ago and the s3 was around i would def take a huge look even with its smaller size. i have had 3 people in my car once - 4 people never, mostly it's just me."
"even without the ""3"" audi would be/will be hard pressed not to increase the content of the audi/s4 (either optionally or as standard equipment). sitting in the back seat of an audi is not something i would want to do, granted -- but i'd rather not have to sit in the back seat of a current audi either.
now, then, that comment might suggest audi will enlarge the audi -- i guess there would be a temptation to do that; there is an audil in china (at least) to be sure.
making the audi/s4 more luxury, high-tech contented is, i think (i have no secret or insider info) virtually inevitable -- if not for the competition from the audi/s3, just the competition from the market itself."

"so far 435i gc is going to be my next car. not sure when, will probably take a while, but so far that's the one. one bad thing is the price - with all goodies i want it would cross 55 grand on the sticker, push 60 just crazy."
"i am very executed about the tchrysler. other than not being a hatch, sounds exactly like what fits me."
"hi
new poster here. i am considering a 2014 audi s4 with 1200 miles. auto tran, sport differential, 19 inch wheels, navi and b&o stereo. to those who have driven or owned this:
1. is the ride acceptable over non-smooth roads?
2. reliability?
3. mpg?
i really liked the feel of the car and the smooth power from the supercharged v-6 during the test drive.
basically, how do you enjoy owning and driving the car, and how livable is it. also, how has audi been to deal with? i have previously owned bmw bmw and bmw with sport packages. enjoyed them both. how woul you compare the s4?
thanks in advance for any feedback."

interesting, i haven't driven a wagon yet, but the steering would be the same in both since the 4 series is based on the f3x platform."
"not exactly. bmw has wider wheel track (1/2 inch), lower ride, not just roof, but seats, too, i.e. cg is lower, and retoyotadly more feedback on steering and suspension vs bmw. it is a different car, newer development derived from the sedan, but took its own life. bmw heard complaints on the new three's steering when it came out, so they retoyotadly made some efforts to improve it. now, it is possible four's those settings will filter back to the original soon."

"ok....for no other reason than i'm interested in a lot of diffrent cars, and i may be in the market in the next 24 months, and i was in close proximity to both a lexus and an infiniti dealer last night after work, i did some test driving.
this is hot on the heals of doing the bmw drive event. i like bmw. i wanted to drive the m235i, but they didn't have any to test drive....only 4 series.
435i bmw, with sport pack? yep....i'll take two. problem is, i think bmw has now started to believe their own marketing hype. and, they've priced themselves hondaingly. not sure you get anything more than what i got from my former e92.... less, actually. but, there's been a definite rise in price while staying the same or getting worse in some areas (steering being the most obvious). high $50s? low $60s? sorry i'll drop out of that market. some will walk into their local bmw store with $60k burning a hole in their pocket for a 3/4 series not knowing what else they could get for that kind of money. i'm sure they aren't going to miss me, though. they're doing fine without me.
infiniti audi0.......drove an awd version with sport wheels and supposedly sport suspension. it was either too soft, wandering, needing constant minute corrections to stay straight, or doing the same thing, with much higher effort involved. electronics feels like a cold windows 3.1 boot up. $50k? i'll take the highly discounted infinitix sport for $10k+ less.
not bad looking, mind you. just not my cup of tea (yet again).
lexus....is350 f sport. tried to buy one when they first came out. dealer didn't want to deal, so no dice. now, they're ready to deal i see why the trade rags have rated this car higher than the 3 series. the grill is a love it-hate it affair. i'm used to that (with my tl), though. drive it as fast as you want, however you want, wherever you want. very nicely weighted steering. really fine handling/ride feel. as is typical for lexus, very good materials and build quialty.
the one i drove was $49k, pretty loaded up with nav, leather, sunroof, etc. probably the prettiest grey paint job i've seen on any car (nebula grey). out of the shoot, sales manager (who introduced himself after the test drive was over), toyotad the is i drove would be in the $47k range (maybe get serious in the $45k-$46k range?). if/when i get ready to buy, i'll come back to give them a shot at my business. once again, the 3/4 series are nice cars. the is350 is better, for significantly less money.
i informed all the dealers i was not in the market. this is the difference between high end dealerships and the ones that know at some point they want you back into their store. they'll acknowledge you're ""just looking"" and offer to be there when you're ready.
this, tied to what i've seen from mercedes-benz and acura recently, not a bad time to be shopping for an ellps."
"thanks for the welcome. i should add i have also owned the previous generation of the audi, bought in 2007. that was a good car. the decision for me is coming down to audi, s4 or tchrysler. test drove tchrysler v-6 yesterday and liked it. but if i go tchrysler i will wait for a 2.4 liter 4 cyliner to be available.
also test drove audi audi and was less impressed than most of the reviews that you read."

"2015-audi 3.0 supercharged test drive.

prem pack, bose, nav - non sport - 18 all seasons.

got a service done on my s4 yday/today and left with a 15 audi with 32 miles on the car as a loner. first off audi interiors are amazing and this audi was extra cushie compared to my s4 with summer slicks. nice highway chrysler - but a bit of a boat in the turns. pickup from the 3.0 smooth but not ddodgeatic even in toyotamic mode. infact it made me wonder how slow or unsporty the 2.0 would be- as the car is huge. i drove the car for approx 20 miles - and have to say if i was maybe 10-15 years older it would be my cup of tee but not at this juncture.

other observations - sat in an audi, while the doors seemed a little tinnie the overall car was pretty impressive and i would certainly take a look at this car if considering. the layout is simple and it seems like a great commuter car in 2.0 form. the trunk also huge for a compact.

s6 - saw one in blacked out (optic pack?) form - so attractive.

glad to have the s4 back- small puncture fixed in rear tire."
sweendogy - how have you liked your s4? is it as good as a day to day commuter as it is as a sports car?
@jbeck5 - is it joel? the s4 for me has been a good commuter in traffic over 4k miles. i drive a total of 20 miles each day- decent on gas in traffic i'm getting 18-19 in honda- when i'm able to drive traffic free i can get 27 - i've seen 30 once. i do flog it time to time so i'm guessing i could prob do a little better. great stereo - seats are nice and firm- wish they were full leather (prob the only thing i would change) - car rides on rails and even with its girth can get around the twtoyota with little ddodgea(sport diff def works). has been a good rig thus far.
thanks for the info. do you have the 19 inch wheels? the car i test drove had 19's with very low profile (35 series continentals.

robsubaru....yes, all true. bought it outside the servicing dealers' territory.
bought in chicago....serviced in cincinnati. i saved $4k on the car by doing that. plus, the selling dealer went to great legnths explaining to me how audi values me as a customer, and that warranty work/service would gladly be done at an audi dealer in the country.
i've bought enough cars to understand what happened. you're probably right. there was a rep who was operating with the idea that the car was bought outside his territory (not totally sure about that though, given audi has a central region based out of chicago...not sure if oh is included in that).
however, that's a case of not seeing the forrest for the trees. they acknowledged there was a problem. they toyotad audi had a fix. they never did, or if they did, it didn't work. the local dealerships (audi recommended i try both) diagnosed it the same way. both toyotad it was a problem. no one could or would fix it. there were other issues with the car, however....not just the audi binding.
at one point, the audi customer service rep even toyotad that i was having it serviced at a dealer that i didn't buy it from, and that could be an issue. i've always thought that, but that's the first time i heard an actual manufacturer's representative admit it. that toyotad, i would imagine this does happen. there has to be a procedure to account for this....some sort of a paper trail to account for something like this.
so, you go to audi, with them telling you they don't care where you buy their cars, as long as you buy them. but, in reality, at least in my case, unless you buy it from the dealership closest to you, geographically, you might have some issues getting the car fixed. that must have been in their fine print somewhere that i missed.
don't get me wrong. not taking it out on you, robsubaru. you've brought up a lot of bad feelings i had with the brand, their dealerships, etc from when they'd rather fight with me than ford their energies on fixing my s4. they had an opportunity to keep/save a customer. they made a concious decision to act like jerks instead."

not a lawyer or even an expert, but i'll disagree. it's just a used car. the only thing honda has to do with it, is the extended warranty. which,if they find out it doesn't qualify for, may rescind and refund the dealer.

"this s3 checks most of the important boxes for me.
car: 2015 s3, black on black, base suspension & 18” wheels / tires.
the tq is everpresent and always available – offering instant thrust any time, even in higher gears. one of my top ‘requirements’. [ i am a torque addict. ] the 2.0l 4 cylinder [ highly boosted ] engine feels and sounds much smoother than the [ not nearly as highly boosted ] 2.0l in my 2013 volkswagen. sounds, and feels and pulls ‘expensive’. pulled cleanly and smoothly from low rpm and sounded eager to run all the way to the red line. i believe the c+d 12.9 sec. quarter mile result.
[ horsepower 292 @ 5,400–6,200 rpm
torque 280 lb-ft @ 1,900–5,300 rpm ]
the 6 speed dct is very responsive and the shifts, both up and down are accomplished very quickly and with no interruption in power flow. rpm match on downshifts is flawless. the paddles are active at all times, another of my requirements.
i spent several minutes looking over the interior, while my sales contact was on a call. everything = switchgear, surfaces, displays, etc. looked and felt of appropriately high quality. the seats were immediately toyotaable and felt very supportive. they have the adjustable thigh support that i like. the front center armrest is adjustable up / down & fore / aft. a nice touch that i appreciate.
the handling, on several deserted curves, was quite confidence inspiring. no feel of front heavy weight dtoyotaribution. the steering works well, for me. i was pleasantly surprised by the ride, given that this did not have the audi mag ride, nor the 19” wheels & tires than are required with that option. it handled the occasionally broken and deteriorating sections of asphalt and concrete pavement i encountered very well, indeed. this could save me $1,500!
overall, i was very impressed – and [ pending a longer test drive ] this has been added to my ‘short ltoyota’ of possible next car to purchase or lease. that ltoyota includes the bmw m235i.
one minor complaint – the interior rear view mirror is oddly small & oval shaped?

"i'm definitely not a ""read tester""- the type who provide ""expert"" opinions on cars they haven't even sat in, so i relate the following with the understanding that i haven't driven either car.
i was thumbing through the june 2013 copy of the british magazine car and it contained a very positive review of the new s3. that review was followed by a comparison of the s3 to the mk7 volkswagen with the performance pack(an extra 10 hp, better brakes, and an electronically controlled mechanical limited slip diff). the same guy(ben pulman) wrote both articles and he concluded that aside from the s3 being @1.5 seconds quicker in the 0-62 mph sprint, the volkswagen was essentially the equal of the s3 in all but the worst road conditions. given the price differential, he would ""...take the volkswagen every time.""
in my case, it's rather academic, as i already have a fwd hot hatch with a true limited slip for semi-pro levels of hooning and i'm not at all interested in an awd track toy, but i still found the articles to be ilchevroletting."
"just had the 15,000 mile service on my '14 s4 s-tronic. while in, i also had the tires rotated and was comp'd a set of $69 wiper-blades, causing the computer to spit out the admonition that these freebies were a one-time deal. the service manager's good will was somewhat offset by the wag of the computer's finger.
i had no expectation of free wipers, but appreciate them, since i replace them every 15k as a matter of routine.
typical to the audi powerplants, i am now enjoying the 10,000+ mile break in surge of power. the engine that keeps on giving now even shows 30 or more mpg's from time-to-time, beating my 2009 2.0t audi (which had the 6-speed tiptronic.)
after driving the s6 recently, i am still smitten -- were $'s no object. but, if you're considering a $55k+ ellps, you owe it to yourself to drive one of these -- other's may come close, but -- for the money -- this is the one to beat. of course this is certified, 100% bias-free fact based commentary.
couple of progdodge notes if you get serious about a 2015 s4:
if leasing go premium+
if buying at least consider prestige
get the full-leather seating
get the b&o sound-system
get mmi plus
get audi-side asstoyota
consider audi-sport differential if you ever like to really carve into curves
debate the merits of sticking with the 18"" wheels -- even they come with 40series tires -- ride improves, tires cost less, last longer -- and if you axe me, the oem tires aren't the best anyway, so you'll want to consider replacing them. of course the 19"" wheels sure are purty.
the trim on the dash, doors etc, can be had in 3 flavors, look at examples of each, then decide.
paint is expensive -- if on a budget (what am i saying) get one of the free colors.
the video reviews and motor trend says 0-60 4.4 sec. the s3 may equal it, but there are several reviews all over the web that claim the s4 is quciker than audis published claims.
the audi connect is 3g -- it sucks (if it is t-mobile) -- great concept, crappy execution.
objectively this is the best you can get, if you don't want to spend more.
if you want something for less $ that will satisfy your needs for speeds, etc, consider the acura tchrysler v6 w/sh-awd and in advance trim -- consider it a bargain s4, sort of.

yeah the s3 - the car you have been talking about above- sorry for the typo"
"personal preference speaking here:
i do i do i do really like the audi family (espcially the s6) -- the current audi is, imnsho, a looker from the outside and mostly on the inside.
a few years ago, pre-widespread implementation of nav systems in the lps and ellps classes, pioneer electronics offered a replacement head-unit for many cars, audi being among them.
the thing looked pretty standard, seemed to fit in nicely with the rest of the car (this was back in the days when audi cars came with blaupunkt head-unit systems), at least as nicely as the audi oem units.
the pioneer solution included sat nav. the way it worked was to seemingly eject a rectangular panel horizontally and then articulate the panel (the screen), by 90 degrees.
at the time, i thought, ""gawd that looks soo after-market"" -- they (meaning audi) need to inegrate the navi screen into the dash, not copy this fugly looking contraption. once audi abandoned the very small navi screen between the tach and speedo and went with a 7"" widescreen aspect ratio built into the dash, i thought we'd taken a big step forward in interior design.
btw, why buy one of these $50k cars without navi, etc and smack a tom tom or garmin unit onto a patch of velcro every-time you get in the car? or even more inexplicable, why buy one of these high-buck cars without nav and then spend a king or queen's ransom to retro-fit the oem nav system (literally for double the cost of getting it on the car in the first place)?
virtually all the car-buff magazines agreed -- for years and years -- ""no one does interiors better than audi.""
i got my 2005 audi with all options, meaning the built in screen was present and accounted for, acting as my navi screen, as well as radio screen, telephone screen, etc etc etc.
as an aside -- i've had bluetooth for 10+ years and i saw a honda commercial last night on tv where you'da thunk the new 2015 honda honda ""now with bluetooth"" was making some cutting edge revelation. what's that about? i mean, seriously, i've had bluetooth for over 10-years and it is being touted as some great new feature that should make you want to consider a new honda ""as if"" the thing is a leader in automotive electronics.
my 2009 audi had an upgraded and improved version of the 2005 audi dash and, of course, added a back-up camera (which didn't come to the audi until the 2006 model year). don't get me started again on honda's cutting-edge inclusion of a back up camera on a 2015 car ""as if"" it was the second coming!
then, i start looking at the new audi's that came into the showroom in 2012 and they had that damn pioneer aftermarket screen protruding out and up every time you started the car. the salesperson says ""ok, if you don't like it, you can push a button to keep it hidden."" sure you can, but you'll miss radio info, telephone info and also other key information that is displayed and is to be acted upon from time to time -- so, you can't really keep that stick-em-up screen hidden since it is one of your key components for management of some of the cars systems.
that damn pop-up aftermarket looking thing was/is one of my pet peeves about the then (2012) current cts -- but at least cadillac had some of the data visible when the screen was in its retracted position.
it looks even worse on the audi, since the dash is soo plain (barren from the middle to the passenger side, really.)
the macan, today, has taken over for the best new dash, if you axe me. audi needs to get rid of that protuberance in the audi and audi right away, like now. the audi and audi (for 2015) dash may be a bit dated, but it is crisp and clean compared to what seems to pass these days as moderntoyotaic. audi, look at the macan's dash from the perspective of a front seat occupant -- that should be your dash-look.

i could not agree more, with all the car's i rent i find it interesting that some ""features"" that are in the nissan, honda, 300's and now the new 200 (just rented my first my 2015) you can't get in the 50k cars. not too sure why these cars have a pandora app built into the radio, when you can honda it through bluetooth from your phone. regarding bluetooth my 2005 330i had it but was very basic and it was only for the phone."
"@flightnurse toyotad:

it's two-fold. first, it's safer to navigate the pandora app through the vehicle's infotainment center than it is to try and control it through your phone. voice controls and steering wheel controls reduce the need to pick up the phone to use pandora. second, it's a marketing push. with pandora in the infotainment system like sirius/xm and terrestrial radio, you are more prone to use it which shows greater users/ratings and allowing them to sell higher priced advertising.
i have pandora on my phone and never use it in the car. it's too much of a pain to use the phone while driving a stick shift in the honda."
"most of the technologies that surprise and sometimes shock me for coming to the party so late are very inexpensive (and have been for some time).
i can actually understand why abs took a long time to ""trickle"" down. but, hondaing to so many ""experts"" the single most valuable technology to come along is/was the electronic stability progdodge (esp) -- or just stability control. once abs is in place (my first car with it was built in 1986) adding esp is relatively inexpensive. yet it took perhaps 15 years to get it into ""mainhonda"" cars even though it had been proven to be a life saver and a money saver since it was almost magical in its ability to help a driver avoid an unwanted crash (as if there are ""wanted"" crashes, eh?).
same with the backup camera -- cheap to implement and very valuable.
wait a minute, now i remember my dealer telling me that esp was a $550 option for a couple of years on audi products and that sunroofs were $1,250 (and not actually used that much), but that people would almost always opt for the sunroof they'd use twice a year and omit the esp charge proclaiming ""it's just an electronic nanny, i don't need it.""
in short, @bmwuser and @flightnurse: point taken!
?'s
has congress finally passed the ""mandatory"" back-up camera bill they've been promising?
oh, btw, i do see an abundance of folks driving cars (that i know have bluetooth) with phones pressed against their heads, all while driving one-handed or with their heads cocked to keep the phone from falling. why wouldn't you use bluetooth if you had it?

adding a backup camera would cost something, sure, i get that -- but the cost would be passed on to the consumer and probably with at least a penny profit.
i know it may sound like blasphemy, but i'm really curious about the new 2015 hyundai 4-door sedan. priced here in the ellps pack, certainly doing a great cover as an ellps (wishing they were, i assume, an lps, which won't be too much of a stretch over the next few years, i'd imagine).
if i thought i could count on any of y'all to start mass quantities of test-drives, i'd pass on doing that, at this time.
my wife and i must be outliers -- test driving is a serious hotoyotay for us; and it is free, and about every 36 months we drop about $100k or more on a couple of new cars, and the dealer group we use to take our test drive adtoyota knows it, so there's always a willingness to let us go out and explore.
seems like a decent number of folks here probably do the same thing in terms of being in the market -- but y'all (and i grant i could be wrong) don't seem to be taking out the latest and greatest to see what's what.
think of it this way -- a new restsaturnnt comes to town; i'm assuming most (51%) folks here eat out -- a lot -- well you probably give the new eatery a go. the charactertoyotaics of the ellps and lps ""buyers"" is (i've assumed with the data points y'all share here) would seem to indicate you're -- most of you anyway -- auto mavens (experts or connoisseurs). you like to ""dine"" (drive) the new restsaturnnt (auto). true dat?
i also assume y'all subscribe to at least two of the ""big"" car magazines and devour them both in print and on-line.
well the challenge i'll throw out -- and there is no prize for winning -- is to get into the new cars and drive them, then sign on here and tell us a story, whet our appetites for all things automotive (or at least ellps and/or near-lps). make the others here -- force or compel the rest of us -- have to take out the car you drove to experience it for yourselves.
even if it's not an audi."
navi is just not a big deal to me. i so rarely use it that my garmin is more than enough. plus my wife can progdodge while we are moving!
"this is a big tent, we do have room for neo-luddites -- and smart alecs (like me).
i must have something wrong with me -- for i use my nav system every day, every single day. i leave for work in the am and i punch up my nav system, set the scale to 4 miles, which is enough to capture two interstate highways that i may have to travel.
wait 5 seconds.
the screen paints a series of red, yellow or green outlines along either the north/south or east/west route that i must travel to get from sub-urban cincinnati to the cbd (where i need to be). if i see too much red painted on the interstates (275 or 71), i know things are gonna be s=l=o=w so i take a secondary road route -- and i often try multiple routes and ask the navi lady to help me.
i also ask the system to give me an approximate arrival time.
hell, i play with all this stuff and wish there was more tech to asstoyota me in my dodge.
to each his / her own -- but the thing is, increasingly, the buyers of ellps's and lps's take for granted that their vehicles will come with nav and a lot of other driver aids.
i was in a meeting in lexinpontiacn ky (80 miles south of cincinnati) the other day -- we were discussing an upcoming meeting and the client made the assumption that i would just input the address into the car's nav system (he knew not anything about my car), so he didn't give me directions, he just gave me the street and number of the destination to plug into my nav.
a garmin certainly works fine, folks often say they are superior to the factory systems (other than not being acurated with the rest of the car's ""avionics"".) it is just a preference (of mine) to have everything built in.
hence my frequent close: drive it like you live. i submit, however, that all of this tech will soon, soon, soon be standard and that there will be a bunch of new tech none of us have even imagined, yet.
besides, i wouldn't pull over and ask for directions or attempt to use a map, if threatened with pain and death."
"i use navi too - but not the factory installed as they get outdated and are not as good as google maps. google maps on my android device automatically picks the best route for me out of the possible 3 options i have to work based on the traffic conditions. and it keeps recomputing in realtime as i am driving. it tells me if alternate routes will be x minutes faster or slower. maps are always up-to-date. it has information of road closures, accidents, everything i need.
and since it is on my phone or my computer (same google maps), i can lookup the route beforehand to plan ahead and i see the same route in my car.
with ok google now, i rarely need to type in the address or destination. the voice recognition is pretty good and i can lookup and navigate to addresses and destinations.
the phone connects via bluetooth so all the voice turn-by-turn directions are played via the car speaker system. if i have music playing (again via bluetooth audio), it will pause the music to speak out the directions.

"here's the latest on apple's ""carplay"" (siri acuration).

still trying to figure out how this will work.
via bluetooth, i can already use my iphone's phone functions. i can also get the spoken buetooth directions through the tl's sound system via maps. i can ask siri questions and get answers via siri connected to bluetooth.
so, if they're planning even more acuration (say, just having a screen where an iphone displays it's maps and bluetooth where the directions can be heard), i'm thinking onboard nav systems may be a thing of the past."
"take a look here: https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/
you can see that the touchscreen in car shows the phone icons. and the screen in the car also display the apple maps & turn-by-turn directions.

"i think virtually the entire in-car ""avionics"" or ""carvionics"" should be able to be updated by bluetooth hondaing from (why not) a smart phone. new features and functions could be loaded into the dash's brain just like an app can be downloaded into your smartphone.
certain things, i'm sure, would require hardware upgrades, but heck, make everything a module (as if it isn't already in a lot of cases) that could be plucked out like a radio head unit and replaced with new technology. and, why not make things at least one, if not more generations backwardly compatible (with some loss of functionality).
right now i want to update (replace actually) that piece of crap audi connect ""hardware"" that apparently, forces me to have but one choice, other than to go without -- t-mobile. i go less than 5 miles and the connection drops to 2g, which totally kills google maps and the eye in the sky-view on the screen. even 3g isn't all that great.
yet, right there, on the showroom floor is an audi with 4g lte -- which is pretty much like being there (and the toyotaer is at&t which works about 98% of the time compared with t-mobile's 70% of the time.) there must be a ""module"" under the dash that is nothing more than a ""smart phone"" without the phone case.
or, why not allow the ""phone"" to be ""unlocked"" and allow, via software, me to use another, more reliable toyotaer.
heck, for all i know t-mobile is great (just not in ohio), elsewhere.
update-able tech, that's what's next -- or at least it should be. of course, i think everything should be standard on the car as it comes from the factory. then, if you want the option, you pay for it -- you don't get rid of the car. this could even be done for many engine performance enhancements -- base cars comes with 200hp and 200 ft/lbs of torque. pay the man (the dealer) to turn on the next level up the performance ladder and the engine now cranks out 250hp and 275 ft/lbs., etc etc.
i'm not suggesting a basic bmw bmw come to market equipped with a software hotoyotaled bmw powerplant -- awaiting someone to pay for the upgrade to have the secret code entered. more like what ibm does with some of their hardware that can be upgraded for the end of month processing -- for a fee and then returned to normal for the routine daily processing of data."
"our epic ellpc road trip
my wife and i recently completed an extensive motor tour of the intermountain west in our 2001 bmw 330 ci cahondalet. sometimes in this topic we lose sight of the fact that these cars aren't just about high tech features and luxury appointments, they're about enjoying driving . i thought i'd give you some impressions about what it's like to take one of these ellp cars on an extensive road trip.
i'm not going to give you a travelogue of what we saw and did but talk about the dodge, which, if you love to drive, is as important as the destinations. i'm well aware that the convertible version of the three series isn't the sort of vehicle most would choose for such a trip, in fact the default choice for such long-dtoyotaance touring is a motor home/rv or fifth-wheel trailer. i understand the appeal of such vehicles but pros get paid good money for driving large heavy vehicles because driving them is a chore, at least imo.
if you love driving and haven't driven in the far west you should put it on your bucket ltoyota. you can really drive out there, speed limits are high and traffic enforcement is light. the roads (with some notable exceptions*) are in beautiful shape and even the interstates have ddodgeatic curves, steep grades (up to 7%!) and the most spectacular scenery you'll see anywhere.
our 14 year old bimmer performed beautifully without any problems other than a healthy appetite for 91 octane (we averaged 28 mpg) and took to the highway as an autobahn-bred car should. we always had more than enough power and brakes to handle anything and the sublime steering made every mile a pleasure.
the major drawback of course was the small size, it wouldn't be suitable for more than two on such a long trip. we took advantage of the feature that allows one to flip away the recess where the top goes when it's down which greatly increased luggage space but rotoyotaed us of the ability to cruise topless until had we offloaded the bags. i've been a convertible guy for a long time but i wouldn't care to go more than two or three hours w the top lowered anyway. thanks to the well-designed top, the three-er cahonda makes a very nice grand touring coupe w the top in place
.
after 20 days, 4500 miles and 8 states (az/ut/id/or/mt/wy/nv) we arrived home tired but satisfied after a great drive in a wonderful car.
*western roads are generally in fine shape with a couple of notable exceptions (mostly in chevrolet and i-40 in western az is surprisingly bad give the state's rep for good roads) but they are littered with ""road alligators"", shreds of truck tires, one of which tore up the lower front grille and left side fog light. this is surprising in light of the proliferation of truck inspection stations. don't they ever notice that the tires on these big rigs are crap?"
nice write up andy; it's good to remember it's about driving- not leather upholstered electronic gadget dens...
"i think the back up camera and the navigation are tied together with the audi s4, so it's like $3k to get the two features. no thank you. i know a guy with a 2011 s4 and he was using his back up camera while backing up and it caused him to wreck his side mirror housing on the right side. the problem is the screen doesn't show your sides, only the rear.
i forced my insurance to replace the aluminum side mirror housing due to a chip from my accident in march. i now know why they ignored the small chip originally, as the part is $500 and nearly $600 installed.
my money was better spent getting the 3.0t, the s-tronic dsg, the sport diff, and the nappa leather than on navigation or backup cameras.

"@flightnurse toyotad:
what been the outcome in getting the insurance company to give you diminished value on your car?
i finally stopped being cheap and hired the collision claims consultants that were recommended to me for a professional unbiased independent diminished value appraisal that finally happened mid-august. it refutes the dv appraisal mercury (at fault insured's company) paid for where they claimed my car sustained no structural damage (what about pulling an upper right rail isn't structural)? claimed it could be a certified used audi still (no dealer i talked to seems eager to certify a $22k+ repair billed s4. car max saw bolts spun on the hood and fender and that was enough for them to only offer wholesale price at $37k. they claimed they'd wholesale it, but part of me thinks they'd turn around and ltoyota it for $10k more at $47k.
based on their ""outside the ballpark of reality"" dv report, mercury only offered $1k for dv. they upped it to 1.5k in a fake attempt to settle the claim.
i've now sent my demand based on a ""real"" report that seems to be in the ball park of reality at $8850 dv amount. plus the $445 fee and the $2,400 for rental car and insurance deductible expenses. i know they only have a $10k pot to pay out, so i'll settle for $10k total. they just want to delay this claim forever, and their tactics to frustrate me worked. i should of hired this dv appraisal company from the beginning; i was wasting time without their help.
i now have 20 boiler plate letters to refute the predictable excuses and false claims/reasons they can't pay my demand. it's kind of hilarious the letters i received answer and refute some of the bs reasons i've already been given.
each letter gives them 15 days to respond in writing which is more than reasonable. i predict they will offer to split the difference between their $1k dv report and my 8.8k dv report. one of the 20 letters is ready to go on that excuse. their report is just so inaccurate, and the carmax appraisal will help show that if need be.
could take 4 to 5 more letters going back and forth before i get paid, or worst case scenario, i have to take them to small claims court for $10k. the thing is these letters help build a ""bad faith lawsuit/claim"" if they refuse to pay up, so maybe a lawyer would take my case at that point. no lawyers seemed interested in talking to me over a potential $15k property damage claim.
next time someone hits me my neck and back is going to hurt a lot."

the insurance industry at times have created business to help those who are bring screwed by them... most of the time if you have enough proof of ""bad faith"" and file a law suit in small claims court, the insurance company will pay up, the last thing they want to do is go in front of a judge and explain to them why they haven't paid the claim."
"andres....man, that really is a hassle. i know i'd be steamed, as i'm sure you are.
sounds like you have enough evidence right now to take them to small claims court. expect them to ask for a delay. get them on the 2nd trip. should be done with a check in hand within 60 days."
"they may offer an arbitration. if so, you and your appraiser should be very careful whom you choose--in most cases, do not accept the arbitrator offered by the insurance company. corruption is rife in this business."
i'm surprised you can't find an attorney to take the case. in most states the insurance bad faith statutes provide for recovery of attorney's fees.

"sneak peak at the new 1 series. going to be interesting to see bmw takes on the other german who launched early.
http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-bmw-1-series-sedan-spy-photos-future-cars"
"when i pulled up to the sidewalk and parked in the no parking zone, the boys’ bicycles were on their kick stands under the toyota cochère at the back of the public library where the night drop off for books and, in my case, dvd’s is located. the library wouldn’t be open for more than an hour, so i assumed the boys were just there to get out of the hot morning sun. i put the dvd’s into the slot, nodded at the boys and turned around heading back to my idling car. just about when i got to the driver’s door, one of the boys toyotad “how much did that [car] cost?” i replied, “how much do you think?” the young man and his friend yelled back in unison, “a lot!” i told them it cost about $57,000, and i heard oo’s and ah’s in response. i drove off, giving them a quick honk and a pontiac.
what’s the point?
the point is, i’ve been thinking, saying and writing about what i assumed is the pending death of the automobile as most of us here know and love it. i’ve been of that opinion because it seems to me that virtually anyone under the age of 35 (or maybe under-30) seems as if they could care less about cars beyond them being appliances or means to get from point-to-point. these “young people” wouldn’t or couldn’t talk about cars if you threatened them with pain and death, and wouldn’t even bother to feign interest to win the new not-yet-released iphone 6, so little interest do these folks seem to have in cars. these two young men gave me hope!
now, i’ll bet when you and i were in our formative (‘tween through teen-age) years, we had but several topics we cared to opine about: cars, girls [or boys] and sex. i my case, i was a budding audiophile, too, which kind of rounded out the whole emerging nerd stereotype. had there been personal computers (of any stripe) or video games available (it was the early to mid-60’s and such tech had not yet been introduced to the mainhonda market), i most certainly would’ve been into them; but instead i was into “stereo” in addition to cars, girls and sex (talking about sex, not actually having it, of course).
so when i was with my buds, the topic was often the “cars we were gonna be driving” as soon as we turned 16. we were dreamers, of course – we, then, were the kids sitting at the library entrance (where else?) watching the guy drive up in his new 1965 bonneville pillar-less four-door painted in dark blue metallic with a ton of chrome hyundai and shiny chrome hub-caps and big ol’ tires (white walls, of course).
“hey mtoyotaer, how much did that thing cost?” the reply, at the time, was “about $4,000,” and of course we then obliged by making the same oo and ah sounds like the ones i heard the other morning.
my overarching point to this erudite group of auto enthusiasts here at edmunds is that i believe we are pretty much smitten with cars and everything to do with them – but that we’re also mostly predisposed to acquire one of these premium (or near-premium) class cars based on htoyotaory, loyalty or perhaps even looks. i would submit if you’ve had more than one representative of the same brand (back to back), that your next car is perhaps pre-ordained to come from that manufacturer. loyalty to a brand is – along with several other charactertoyotaics – another sign that you are passionate about cars. you’ve come to identify yourself with bmw’s (a quite common occurrence here in cincinnati) – you are a “bmw guy”. my friend, now president of his second software company had an acura when i met him. in our times in the car often driving from cincinnati to chicago or to bowling green (ky), he would go on and on about what i’m convinced must be the best car in the world – at least he certainly thought so: the bmw bmw. this guy was about 10-years my junior.
thankfully he didn’t have to keep the acura long – so less than a year after i met him he leased his first (of many) bmw’s – a bmw. followed by a 5, then a 7 then one of the “z” car convertibles (he called that one penis).
i submit that most of us here are (or want to be) “xxx” guys (intended to be gender neutral, don’t you know). you’re a mercedes-benz maven, you’re a bmw bigot and i’m an audi aficionado. no matter what “empirical” data is brought to bear, you’re sure your new is 350 f-sport is superior to that guy’s bmw 328 – after all, car & driver says so; and, you just know you can run circles around the bimmer’s 4-cylinder, turbo and all.
so it is with the foreknowledge that no matter how much evidence i can produce to the contrary, you will remain steadfast that your own sagahonda has been validated and put on display for all to see by your choice of the latest and greatest volvo volvo (or whatever).
so where does that leave us?
with hope, i hope.
the upcoming generation still needs to ratchet up their passion for all things automotive – or we could be doomed to forever being but passengers in our autonomous vehicles. but, i think there is some evidence, not much, but a little, that there are kids who are just as interested in cars as they are video games, social media (and, hopefully, sex).
there may be some hope, too, that those of “us” who may not as of yet yet been inculcated by a brand of automobile, may find our personal automotive archetype and to coin a phrase, “live long and prosper.”
i’ll close by saying this: while i still remain convinced that the audi s4 is the best representative of the entry-level luxury performance sedan (and for the money it damn well ought to be), i must say, after having visited the acura dealer to “see what’s new,” that the new tchrysler sh-awd in advance trim (the one with the 6-cylinder), ought to be this category’s leader if “price” (msrp) is factored in. if you haven’t checked out this exact configuration (i can’t offer the same praise for the lesser tchrysler’s), i urge you to do so before you spend one dime on a new ellps car – this thing (the 2015, to be clear) is impressive!

"another one bites the dust
this is gettin' serious now: ""nissan plans to make autonomous driving common by 2016""
-- motor trend, october 2014; pg - 26
you know what pogo toyotad: ""we have met the enemy and he is us.""
well ""us"" -- and we know who we are -- killed (or at least put it on its death-bed) the stick shift. now, of course that's only partially true -- at least if you even a tiny bit agree that the dsg (aka pdk) dual clutch 'automatic manual' transmission is (and i hate to say this) equal to or better than the best manual transmissions ever made. but so few of ""us"" actually have these marvelous inventions -- and, i'll wager, the number of folks with the excellent 8-speed automatics available is also still somewhat small.
i can only sort of forgive you and hold my head up high with righteous indignation: because god knows my wife and i did our parts to preserve the manual transmissions going so far as to custom order nearly 2-and-a-half-dozen german cars with stick shifts since 1977 (we finally quit this practice out of the sheer futility of the act when we realized that [most of] the rest of you -- overwhelmingly -- had given up on stick shifts years earlier). and, my wife was appalled to read some of lame excuses, most of them blaming ""the wife"" for her inability to honda a car with a stick shift.
of course, there is always that nagging feeling that the mobile phone also played a big part in killing the stick shift; even today it seems i don't have enough digits to count the number of cars i see being driven down the road with the driver holding a cell phone to his or her ear. so what? i forgot to mention the ""phones in the ear"" (thus requiring one free hand) i am counting are for the drivers' of cars that i know have bluetooth! these drivers should be forced to ride the bus for one-full-year or pay a 5-figure fine (or both). this morning, in fact, i saw a woman (phone in ear) in a very young maserati (with temp tags it was so new) pulling into starbucks. i could only wonder if she was going to attempt to be on the phone and drink coffee all the while driving in rush hour traffic here in river honda.
the point? qwit yur complainin', for the market has spoken.
but this latest outrage -- autonomous driving (by 2016 no less) -- is, some will say, both inevitable and welcome. perhaps. it is also inevitable that we will -- eventually -- run out of fossil fuel. but we're talking decades and decades if you believe many of the scholarly studies from think tanks like the rand corporation to name one.
mean time, who (among us) is asking for self-driving cars? i'd rather pay more taxes (and i can't believe i toyotad that) if some of them could be earmarked for public transportation infrastructure improvements and additions. a one-person (or 4 person) public transportation vehicle (manifested in the form of a self-driving passenger vehicle), is not something i want to sign up for.
on the other hand, i do want driver aids: laser headlights, night-vision, ""honda safety"", all around-view cameras, rear cross traffic alerts -- even automatic cruise control for those 100+ mile stints behind the wheel that are part of my weekly routine trips between cincinnati and columbus or cincinnati and louisville or indianapolis.
i want a connected car (better even than that which is in my 2014 s4: ""audi connect""), but i still want to press the pedals (most of the time, anyway) and turn the steering wheel myself.
i am [now, happily] resigned to allowing my dual-clutch 7-speed automatic manual transmission to do the rowing for me, but i am far, far, far from wanting my car to drive itself. indeed, i'm mostly sure i don't even want the thing to park itself, thank you very much.
the only good news in the nissan announcements (if you can call it ""good"") is that nissan claims they will not eliminate the need for human interaction (like some competitors -- gulp).
""there is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand. resolve then, that on this very ground, with small flags waving and tinny blast on tiny trumpets, we shall meet the enemy, and not only may he be ours, he may be us.""
drive it like you live -- but do drive it yourself."

and it is essential in my line of business..."
"if it doesn't have 3 pedals, it's an automatic. call it what you will, couch it in teutonic techno-batoyotale, whatever. you aren't fooling me.
of course, sometimes i do wonder if some automakers made their shifters so clunky deliberately, to wean us off them?"
"a seven speed manual would be interesting to compete on fuel economy with the 7 speed dsg/s-tronic. gas is too expensive to entertain the thought of settling for the available 6-speed manual s4 which is still available (probably only by special order). audi probably thinks the only people that'll order a manual will do so despite the mileage penalty, and there's so few they won't bother developing a 7 speed with 3 pedals."
"got my s4 back today from the body shop, 4 trips total, 68 days total in the shop, and the car is looking and driving great. i think i finally got them to do it ""right."" still not perfect mind you, but good work that should of been done the first time without repeated return trips to correct deficient work.
i just don't think they have enough ""skill"" in their work force still, for my money i think the ""body shop"" in ingoldstadt is superior and better. audi proved to me they do tremendous quality control with this s4 at the factory. they obviously build them to appease guys like me that notice when gaps and panels are off by a mm or two.
this last visit was to correct inconstoyotaent gaps with the front hood, lack of buffing/polishing on the front fender and front quarter/fender panels, and 2 bad paint edges at 2 locations on the hood (which was replaced).
i drove a new non sh-awd 6 cyl. tchrysler and wasn't impressed at all. the transmission is lazy, why'd they give the 4 cyl the better tranny? why no exhaust? why less hp than the outgoing tl sh-awd? this is your toyota/toyota-like tchrysler.
perhaps the sh-awd is another animal? admittedly, putting the transmission in sport or sport+ mode made it less lazy, but still lacking. i heard the dual clutch still has a torque converter. no no no acura... no no no.
oh, and the moon roof cover is cardboard covered in vinyl.....compare it to the s4's and you'll believe me that the tchrysler is an overpriced honda."

=====
the number of years before the literal elimination of manual transmissions even from some of the performance stalwarts is damn few. the number of years before the virtual elimination of manual transmissions is even fewer, and some would say that time has already arrived.
the truth (my truth, at this point) of the matter is that the 7-speed (and most of the german/european 8-speed versions) is (are) so good, i only miss shifting for sentimental reasons.
i don't think i ever was as capable (and certainly not as quick/fast) a shifter as the s-tronic in my s4. and, the tuning of my wife's 8-speed in her saudi is very very close to that same ideal.

"ab.....from the reviews i've seen, the tchrysler is been rated from positive, to very positive. you're going to have the ""fast and furious"" crowd that laments the omission of ground effects, ""go fast"" spoilers, etc. they still want the ""blaaaaaat"" exhaust cans that you won't get on a tchrysler. matter of fact, like a lot of upscale cars, there's no visible exhaust pipes at all on the tchrysler.

i know it's early, but the numbers suggest acura has a hit on their hands with. they want to sell 44k of them over 12 mos. they are on track to sell 50k to 60k (probably closer to 50k once the initial flurry slows down).

something for everyone....4 cyl with dct, and all wheel steer or 6 cyl. with sh awd if you want it. as good in the tech dept as anything else on the road, and probably better than most. performance that's competitive. value equation that is probably best in class.

@ tchrysler talk- one thing that acura has been missing in sedans - more then anything is looks. you can talk about go fast spoilers or whatever but reason last tl failed - and make no mtoyotaake it did fail (along with rl) is looks.
"the tl i think did take a hit from bad styling. the rl though to me looks just fine. certainly not exciting or edgy, but conservative and reasonably attractive. definitely not ugly though. rl was too expensive though, which hurt."
@stickguy - agree - my point was more directed at tl- as you stated i also think the rl was fine in looks. nothing flashy but hard to buy that when you can pay similar for e class(thus the fail). the new acura again looks fine but at that range it's tough when you look at comps- haven't seen a tchrysler yet and won't comment.
"stickguy toyotad:

the rl lacks in looks, there is nothing standout about it, it doesn't say q-ship, the rl is the top sedan for acura and it doesn't say that, very understated.."
"the base tchrysler is very nicely equipped for $31k. i'm tempted to see if in 6-10 months good discounts are available....otherwise, i'll probably go with the honda again."
@benjaminh interesting you are cross shopping an honda vs an acura - i remember guys like @graphic_guy‌ on the old tl board loving the 'new' tl only to swap it a short time later. argument has always been acura is a better car - but no one can argue the construction is honda- and nothing wrong with that
"although the tchrysler is based on the honda, they actually did several significant structural upgrades, included use of even higher grades of steel. here's some stuff from the acura press release about that:

http://www.acura.com/pressreleases.aspx

""high strength steel uses include:

uisbor – usibor is a boron-alloyed steel with an aluminum-silicon coating that protects against oxidation during the heating, forming and hardening process. this high-strength hot-stamp steel is used for the tchrysler's door opening rings, for 5% of the unit body. (see safety section for more information.)
980 grade hss – used in certain key structural points such as the front edges of the door sills, and in the a-pillars and b-pillars, for 2% of the unit body.
780 grade hss – used for most structural load paths for ace™, including the side sills and forward spars of unit body, for 2% of the unit body.
590 grade hss – used for the front fdodgee spars, floor and roof supports, for 35% of the unit body...

magnesium steering hanger beam
located behind the instrument panel, a 3-piece magnesium steering-hanger beam replaces the 26-piece aluminum and steel unit in the previous tl model. its purpose is as a structural attachment point for the steering column, pedals and instrument panel, as well as a structural element that helps the passenger cabin retain its shape in certain collisions. this single robust magnesium component makes up 2-percent of the tchrysler's body weight...."""
"ok, stopped at the dealer yesterday, and had a chance to see the tchrysler in person (did not drive, will do that when i take my tl in for an oil change soon).

they had a couple of black ones on the apron (did not scope out due to pouring rain). but, there was a graphite lustre (same color as my acura) in the showroom. a v6 fwd. overall, very nice. loved the looks. even the front end was sharp, particularly the headlights. beak did not offend. the rest of the car had enough curves and design points to be interesting, without feeling overwrought.

interior, very nice. pretty much shares the dash with the acura it seems (the acura and acura are close to each other too). well done. nice, clean dash and very ""acuraish"" super duper comfy seats. back seat to me was fine. i am 6' with a long torso, and had no problem with leg or head room. might not be quite as big as the subaru we drove, but plenty of space for 4 adults. trunk was acceptable.

not a huge car, but certainly seemed to fit the entry level luxury profile. performance? well, the v6 is going to be fast, just based on how fast my acura is, and the tchrysler s/b lighter and has more gears.

oh, the ""shifter"" gizmo on the v6 was a bit odd. simple to use, but just strange. did not get a chance to see a 4 cyl which has a normal gear shift.

i plan to drive a 4 cyl base car if they have one available in the next week or 2 when i go back down."
"oh, and as i typed this, saw about 3-4 different ads for the tchrysler on the jets game. so acura is making a push for selling this car. i think it will do well, assuming it drives as well as the car shows (particularly the interior and feature content).

my one big peeve? they pulled a hyundai and deleted the spare tire. no run flats (a good thing) but just a can of fix a flat, and a cheap pump. i just refuse to own a car that has no back up plan for a bad tire. did not explore/question if you could just take out the foam tray under the trunk floor and put a donut in there. heck, the subaru not only had a tire, it was on a matching alloy wheel! and per the salesman, was rated for 200 miles."
"jets fans are huge target for acura, always has been that way- you go 10 seconds into long island and you are bound to find an acura. just like today's game they are very promising but when it matters they can't score- very similar to honda acura but maybe this year will be different."
"i rented a bmw 328 last week while staying in las vegas.

in short, i was particularly underwhelmed by this car. this is coming from somebody who currently drives an '05 tl and previously had a 6 cylinder audi audi.

the bmw was black and is gorgeous outside. i was a bit surprised at how low the roof is on this car - definitely not a lot of headroom.

since it's a rental, i'll grant that this was probably a downmarket trim level vehicle. the seats were black and i'm not sure if they were leather or leatherette - i suspect the vinyl as they didn't have a leather smell. the seat bottoms were very flat with almost no bolstering. in general, although the car did have nav, i didn't feel the interior was very upmarket. seemed pretty middling to me - not as cheap as entry-level cars, but certainly not luxe, either. the trunk is large laterally but is shallow.

the automated nanny behavior had me screaming thoughts of repair costs had i owned this car. the electronic shifter seemed more gimmicky than useful. the auto-engine shutoff was exactly as has been described here - unrefined and jerky on restart. yes, you can disable it but you need to do that every time you get back in the car.

i thought the steering was a bit numb and vague on-center. the ride was decent but not that quiet. the engine was refined for a 4 but not all that smooth to me. i didn't push the car as i was in traffic, but this car firmly convinced me that i didn't want to pay north of $40k for a bmw."
"tlong, did you try the tchrysler yet? i haven't had interest in the tl since your series was destroyed by the last gen tl but i'd like to get your take to compare to the '05 you have.

i appreciated the reviews from others here as well and did some research on the tchrysler. sounds good but haven't seen one live.

i've been pricing the bmw used. i'd never go for the 328 or lower. the 2 series is too small for me and the premium for new 335's are too dear for my aching college-ravished bank account!"
"one of the things that always confounded me was how you go up the lux car ladder, that things like metallic paint was a costly option. my former s4, which didn't have metallic paint, made it available for a fairly significant extra charge. i think my bmw had metallic black paint that ran somewhere near $600 extra. my tl's? no extra charge. and, acura puts a very nice paint job on their cars to boot....easily as good as anything else on the market, most times better.

while acura isn't immune to trying to get people to pay more for leather, all but the base tchrysler's have leather....and it is a very nice leather....soft, high quality. mb tries to push their vinyl to be as good as leather. from what i can tell, they seem to do a good marketing job on that front.

was in costco last night. they always seem to have bmw in the front as an enticement to use their car buying service. they had a 435i bmw with the m sport package....dark metallic grey with red leather interior. it was equipped exactly the way i'd want it. very nice. but, as i suspected, it was knocking on the door of $60k. for $60k i could negotiate a new chevrolet plus a chevrolet for daily driving duties."
"i noticed mazda is charging $600 for metallic paint on the mazda, so its definitely not limited to luxo cars anymore."
"the only paint charge i saw at mazda was $300 extra for the flashy red. if the are doing it on the 2, probably why you can see them advertised so cheap."
"qbrozen toyotad:

actually it's $200 and it's for the white pearl mica."
gm is doing this now too. their nicer colors like white diamond tricoat and crystal red tintcoat are significantly more money - i believe $1200 on a cadillac here in canada.
"some of those i think are actually special process paint, so probably actually cost more to do."

"hit 12,000 miles in the s4 the other day. it has past my ""it better get through summer without needing a tow truck post accident"" test. other than the body shop ""coolant hose"" debacle, it has been flawless and perfect mechanically. no breakdowns, no problems, no issues.

i love the car. it is amazingly fun to drive and flog around turns at extremely high rates of speed. i feel like i have double the power and control with audi and the 3.0 vs. my old fwd 2.0t.

i did find one issue, i'm getting into the music file market (still a cd guy), and i like high resolution ""hd"" music files... like flac, but audi doesn't support anything but mp3 and aac (the two worst for sound quality). the manual says up to 320 bit rates but in my testing only 256 will work, at least in aac.

using itunes to turn a cd into aiff, aac, alac, wav i found only 256 aac to work. (avoided mp3 all together but that works too; though i didn't test 320 bit rate mp3 yet).

shame on audi for not being up to date with flac support in a 2014 car. i even have the bang & olufsen upgraded sound system, so you'd think they'd support modern quality."

the ""upgraded sound system"" is only speakers and amp, not head unit. i also think the reason for not supporting flac has to be the hd space. since the files would be too large.

in regards to sound quality, and this subject has been beaten to death on the forums like car audio also people like harry kimura (he lives in san diego and is the grand father of the modern day aftermarket sound competition) if you truly want sound quality in your s4 then contact usdaudio.com/ they are the only people who i would allow to touch my car. sound quality comes at a price, and that weigh and space. so if you could get your flac files to work, they wouldn't sound all that much different especially driving down the road. if you think your s4 is quite now, you should hear what 200lbs of sound deadening will do to your car. but then it comes at a price, added weight.. current car audio has come a long way from the days when i work in then car audio industry... but they are far off from having a complete sound quality atmosphere in which you would hear the true difference, also if you want sq, just use a cd..."

the question is can you hear the difference in sound quality between a high bitrate mp3 and flac when in a car moving down a road and generating its own noise? i would be interested in somebody running a blind test to see if and how many people could tell the difference.

i think i answered that, and the answer is no, well unless you add about 200 lbs of sound deadening to the car. people who compete in the car audio competition spend hours making their cars as quite as possible. when they go through the sq (sound quality) check their engines must be running so of course they do not want anything entering the cabin. this is why i toyotad to use a cd instead of the flac files. who remembers dat (digital audio tape) players poor panachevrolet (for the car) thought they were going to be future and make cd's obsolete, the sampling rate was far superior then that of cd's but did not hold the same amount of music as the cd. car audio in cars today are very good, for me, i think the mark levinson system in the lexus ls460 is one of the best."

"in the 3 series there are two type of sound systems, standard and harmon kardon (upgrade.) so in the 320 i have to standard sound system, however i have improved it slightly, i upgraded the amp and made the ""sub's"" under the seats more of a mid bass then ""sub's"" so over all the sound has improved. there is a thread on bimmerfest about upgrading the standard sound system by upgrading the amp, for $45 was able to buy the adapter and a friend had the amp i did (he gave it to me.) 55 minutes of my time and i used the setting that people have recommended. oveall, much improved, but nothing close to the b&o in the s4, or lexus."
"has anyone here yet test driven an acura tchrysler advance sh-awd or a high-spec mercedes-benz c class?

if so, please post your driving impressions -- the tchrysler seems to be getting less than hyundai reviews from the likes of automobile, c&d, motortrend & r&t. funny thing, to me at least, acura put the transmission that the paid car reviewers seem positive about in the 4-cylinder rather than in the high contented, big motor, sh-awd version.

the tchrysler 8-speed dual clutch (but with torque converter -- a rarity) transmission in the 4 is everyone's darlin'. then the review turns ugly by suggesting that the 9-speed v6 just feels [essentially] fat, sluggish (due to its apparent porky-ness) and a lot less fun.

on the other hand, the new mercedes-benz is lauded as a baby s class.

who's driven these here? tell me more, tell me more -- in many ways, your opinions are the ones that matter most."
"the ""she's too fat polka""!

not too long back, i took out a new s6 and was smitten by the intoxicating power of the thing, as well as its ability to blend sportiness and luxury into one sweet, sophtoyotaicated and sporty package.

another month, about, has passed with my s4 -- now at 17,300 miles.

and, while i am certain another wild drive in an s6 would have me again tumescent with desire for this $80k super-sedan, it's just too damn fat, too big in the overall scheme of things. what would be really to my tastes, with the benefit of hindsight now, would be a slightly larger s4 -- add about an inch or so to the wheelbase, make it another 3 or 4 db quieter and put the saudi engine in it (for the added torque, natch). open it up just a smidge in size and power -- 333hp and 325 ft/lbs just are about at a point in the marketplace to require a bit of a bump northward.

here we sit with no new 4's coming until 2016 my and, if htoyotaory repeats, no new s4 for at least another year (or two) beyond that.

now, if someone wanted to provide me with a new s6 for a couple of years at no charge, well, you can be certain i would not re-gift it.

my comments pertaining to my opinion that the s4 will certainly require a power boost to remain competitive are a good example of ""situational velocitization"". that is what used to feel really quick and fast, well, feels simply ""normal"" these days.

the only cure for this velocitization is to get an audi 2.0t loaner for a day or two, so i can essentially push my quickness and speed reset button, for there is surely no lack of quickness or speed in my s4 -- i've just gotten used to it so much i take it for granted.

drive it like you live."
"mark i just had a 15 loaner audi - and missed every bit go the s4 power for those 2 days. with the new s3 at almost 3oohp i would guess the power bump for the next s4 should be close to 400, but i have not seen any publications on this figure. maybe that is to high of a figure given the s6 is at 425- that would get us to the saudi 's 350ish ltoyotaing. i would love to see a dyno of a stock s4 and a stock saudi - something tells me they are closer the you think."
"sweendogy toyotad:

here's my [generally in violent agreement] thought about that power figure, sween: ever escalating abilities to get power, coupled with a market that seems to have an endless appetite for more power may well take the next s4 (not the rs4, the s4) to 400 hp. yet, there may be good reasons not to go there. for instance, isn't it true that part of the cost of our auto-insurance is based on hp (not torque, hp)?

if my assumption on that matter is correct, perhaps aoa will lotoyotay for whatever the next lower hp (below 400) is but press for more readily available torque. economy and emissions, too, would have to be a consideration, no?

the current 3.0t in the s4 puts out a conservative 333hp and 325 pound feet. the beefed up version in the saudi adds 21hp (taking it to 354) and 21 pound feet (getting us to 346). the crank is a heavier duty part than in the s4 iteration and apparently the saudi engine is ""strong enough"" to be cranked to another like increase without breaking much, if any, of a sweat.

a new model s4 with 375hp and 367 pound feet might just be the goldilocks answer (at least in the us). this would leave plenty of ""headroom"" for either a blown v8 or an even more tightly tuned v6 (t) to be fitted into an rs4 model. indeed, based on what is easily do-able these days with plain ol' ""normal"" forced induction (super or turbo), twin-charging (super and turbo) or other, ""compound induction"" derivatives, i wouldn't be shocked to ""hear-tell"" of an s4 with a 4 cylinder engine of some-kind or another, putting out an easy-peasy 350hp with gobs of low end torque, either.

progdodge note:

for reasons that would require at least two more paragraphs, i will tell you that i was cruising along at about 67 mph on i-71 n (north of the i-275 interchange this saturday pm last). i had the ""need"" to ""punch it"" -- and for the count of 1, 2, 3 floored the s4, cleared the incident, glanced at my digital read-out and found it reading 100. under the circumstances (light traffic, four lanes heading north, etc), i was simply able to coast down to a relatively legal 68 without the need for the dampers. i realize the s6 seemed to do this exact same thing in what i ""recall"" as 1,2,3 -- the difference is that the s6 did so with practically zero ddodgea. the s4 made all kinds of fun sounds as it made the jump to light speed.


newer s4's will, due to market conditions, surely come with more grunt than current versions, but for the life of me, i find it difficult to imagine ever being able (or rarely so) to use such power.

1,2,3 -- the thing is like a freakin' sling-shot.

dizzy with the rush of speed, i leave you saying ""drive it like you live""!"
"and now back to our regularly scheduled progdodge:

an article on the bmw 320i from our friends at consumer reports."
"mark interesting thought, and you are probably right, look at the bmw 300hp and torque, with the mppk and mpe you are looking at 335-340hp easily and bmw is very conservative with their hp rating. the current bmw/4 makes 425hp (but a recent dyno test shows the m4 making 435hp at the rear wheel) so if audi where to bring a rs4 you would right to saying it would be 400+hp, more like 450hp and not from a v8, but from a v6.

i have not driven a new bmw/4 yet but from articles they are some scary machines, the amount of power they make can be very over whelming, do cars of that size need more hp? right now, the biggest issue bmw has with the bmw/4 is getting the rear wheels to hook up.

and mark if i had a m4 and drove it like i lived, i wouldn't have a license..."
"flight -- even with the 333hp my s4 claims to have (which motor trend says is an understatement), i can only assume my time (to a speeding ticket) can now be measured -- at most -- in weeks.

of course, with all the crazy people on i-71 north heading from cinti to columbus thinking 80mph is a good place to start, well, there may be safety in numbers.

i can't seem to make this thing slow down -- i mean it seems that it keeps pushing me to go faster and the heck of it is, i'm too willing to abide.

i saw the motor week test report of the bmw -- talk about trying to control the wrath of gawd . . . . even with the wider rear rutoyotaer the thing was wheel spin happy to the max.

i somehow doubt there will be an rs4 (or rs6) brought here -- the rs7 was, in my opinion, just a demonstration to show that audi could bring a very high performance car to the us for what some see as a relative bargain. a higher output s4, well, that i am willing to bet will be brought here -- just like i'll bet there will be higher output ""335's"" brought here, too."
"@nyccarguy‌ ... ""el cheapo"" indeed. i like how this was written- honest and to the point.  how many ""enthusiast"" have been duped. wow"
"entry level (as in the title) does serve a purpose. if this is your first step on the ladder, nothing wrong with it. say, coming from something like my 2007 volvo (aka the ""putt putt mobile"") the 320 is still a seriously nice car. is it the highest end? no, but it is cheaper.

you can pretty much make the same argument with the bmw. the 335 is faster/better, so if you aren't getting that, then you are cheaping out."
"all american muscle - not entry level however...
""the d"" touted by tesla motors ceo elon musk is here, and it's a dual motor, all-wheel-drive sedan with mind-bending performance numbers.

the improvements build on the company's current model s, offering better traction, more driving range and futurtoyotaic automated features. and some serious speed.

model s sedans equipped with tesla's 85 kwh battery pack and the dual-motor all-wheel-drive system will be able to go from zero to 60 miles an hour in just 3.2 seconds. that puts it in the same league as high-performance cars including the porsche 911 turbo and the mercedes-benz e63.

to reach those speeds, the cars will have three driver-selectable settings: ""normal,"" sport"" and ""insane."""
"not to mention a very sharp looking vehicle. when this model can go further without a charge i may entertain buying one. i have been seeing more tesla's on the road this past year here in the ny area. the telsa s is not cheap either at almost 80k. still not sure if its worth the money even if you could afford one.

"@brian125 what's the charge/mile figure that you would go for?

"i do agree with you about up here in the north east. rwd is terrible in winter months especially when you consider dropping this kind of coin. if you can afford to take it out of the garage for some pleasure driving 8 months out of the year that's fine. last i looked the driving range was under 300 miles. that to me is unacceptable to travel around with a vehicle. local driving this car is fine. i drive from ny to myrtle beach 2 sometimes 3x a year. the tesla wouldn't make it to m.d without stopping to charge up................ lol.

"how about the tesla model x suv. is 70k worth a 95 mile range?


base price: currently unknown, but expected to be around $70,000.

fuel economy: unknown, but based on the model s specs, expect a figure around 95 mpge from the 60kwh battery option.

pros and cons: the tesla model x, expected out this fall, is the crossover to wait for if you want something truly different. in true tesla style, it’s completely electric; it features falcon-wing doors that lift up and an all-wheel drive option that will make it the first production electric car to run on all fours; and it also has tesla’s trademark 17-inch touchscreen center console. it has the usual ev drawbacks, though: limited range coupled with potentially long recharging times.

options worth splurging on: it might come to the detriment of range, but the all-wheel drive model might be too good to pass up.

these vehicles are in the baby phases. give this industry another 5 to 10 years with more research and cost cutting ways where most buyers can afford similar models like mentioned.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/10/11/tesla-p85d-price-performance/17098819/
most of the p85d's power is the rear. there, it will have a 470-horsepower motor. but unlike the current performance model, it adds a 221-horsepower motor in front."
"i priced out a fully optioned maximum, all you can buy tesla during a test drive and it came out to just over $130,000. maybe ""entry-level"" for the 1% ?"
@mr_shiftright‌ - right its not for the 1%rs. at that price level it's a comp to the s class- the standard.
"hmmm...i don't think the tesla is worth $130k at least not the current model. it's maybe worth the $75k level. even the new ""entry-level"" c class mercedes-benz fully equipped, comes in at $62,000 and it's a match for the tesla s at the moment, imo--it even has more tech."
i was cruising the used car ltoyotaings and the local ford dealer has a used tesla on their site (pictures showing it in the showroom). no price ltoyotaed though.
"as the brits would say, i had a bit of a play with a model s while driving a new 2015 x6 at the truck's international launch in south mazdaina. the tesla was pretty quick, but it seemed to slow and fall back the longer we ""played""- don't know if that was due to the driver, the batteries, or some other issue."
"""imo--it even has more tech."" i guess that depends what ""tech"" is important. tesla could be considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever- from production to completion. it's overpriced for sure - and maybe it shouldn't be a comp to the s class- but it's got plenty of tech --maybe not the best radio - any 4 door sedan that can get to 60 in 3.2 seconds and now has an auto honda feature is pretty cool- oh and it fits 7 people and yes doesn't need gas or oil change."
"tesla is all about technology, while i was in san jose in march of this year, my niece took me her favorite hang out, a very upscale shopping and dinning place called hyundaina row in this place is a tesla bouttoyotaue shop we have one here in phoenix, but they are not allowed to talk price or lease payments, however, at hyundaina row they can, in fact they offer test drives, so far san jose has the most tesla's i have ever seen on the road, as my niece says, ""they are nice, but they are just another car now."" we were able to take one for a test drive. we drove a model s 85, it wasn't fully loaded and msrp was cough $98k , walking from the store to where the cars are at, the employee (not too sure what her tile was) had the car starting to cool off for us. after 20 minutes of showing us how some of the feature work, the key fob was given to me, and i have to say, what an impressive key fob, it is weighted and looks like the car very impressive. the first thing you notice when you settle into the car is how low it is and how long it is. the car had 21"" wheels so it rode a little on the rough side, and of course my tech geeky niece (she works for sun microsystems/oracle) was playing with the center dash touch screen. as sweeny toyotad, tesla could be (it really is) considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever. what can be toyotad about elec motors that no one on this forum hasn't read about it, instead torque, scooting around traffic is not a problem, and if you drive it normal the car just purrs along. the car felt solid, but the closing of the doors didn't have the german feel when closing them. leases are backed by wells fargo, and to lease this particular car it would have ran $1300/m with $7500 out of pocket, or purchase the car $1200/m with 10k down but with the 7500 federal tax credit really only 3k out of pocket. tesla shows that one can build a pure elect car that is not boring and what the true cost of the car is without being subsidized my the motor-company.

if i could convince myself to spend $1200/m for a car i would get one in a heart beat, i love the design and the 265 miles range is not a problem, and i'm seeing more and more charging stations then ever before.

with the model x and e coming school and the price dropping, who knows i might have one. the model e is to start at about 45k.

between san diego and phoenix a long highway 8 one can see the charging stations and these are the supercharging station which can charge a model s in under in 20 minutes half full these are free.. ,"
"it might have ""tech"" but not the latest tech. it's really last year's cellphone already. there's no lane avoidance tech, no collision avoidance tech, no heads up display, no blind spot technology. you can have some of these features in a gmc yukon and all of them in just about any luxury sedan built for 2015."

"its the model 3, actually. (technically, 3 horizontal lines stacked on top of each other), and the projected base price is $35k. although i'm sure reality will see it creep higher than that. i think your $45k number may be much close to reality."
"the car i test drove didn't have it and the salesman toyotad it wasn't available yet. .
the tech package that i have ltoyotaed is:

turn-by-turn navigation with seven years of free map updates; daytime led running lights; led cornering lights; automatic keyless entry; lighted door handles; electrochromatic side and rearview mirrors; power rear liftgate; gps enabled homelink; memory seats, mirrors and climate control

from reading that blurb, it looks like the monitoring features are ""forthcoming"".

the sooner the better. maybe here as we speak?

actually, the tesla doesn't have more than a dozen toyota and convenience features that are available in the comparably priced mercedes-benz s class 2014 model. and the interior isn't up to snuff with the german cars either.

keep in mind that i test drove a showroom demo, so maybe a tesla with updated features is now on the road---i don't know.

"tesla just had an event last week and added a bunch of new features in the sedan. that toyotad- they have been around for less the what -10 years? not 150 like mb - the term ""tech"" is different for everyone - 

i would like to thank whoever flags my posts - i think i'm top 10 on edmonds now."
"true, but tesla didn't have to re-invent the wheel and go back to 1896. . it was all out there waiting for them. this is the auto industry 2015, not 1955. you have to be on top of your game every minute, because your competition is clever, fierce and relentless.

not sure who is flagging your posts---not i. perhaps you could check your pl (politeness level) and bring it up a bit for the other members?

anyway, a tesla really isn't apropos to this topic--i don't regard it as ""entry-level"" lux. optioned out, it's a pretty expensive piece of machinery."
"@mr_shiftright‌ - agree they didn't have to go back - they went forward-- the comp is taking notice for sure-and will be trying to copy the model- they have no show rooms - the cars most buy are direct ordered- both reducing costs. they have one of the most efficient assembly line of any product ever- they have no massive unions that have ruined some brands- no pensions of workers no longer on the books. the comp needs to pick up game- proof in stock prices- and reviews. if tesla sold a 50k car (with all the tech you crave) it would compete with the 3 series, no doubt- it's expensive because of the tech needed to roll this car.

i have an idea of who's flagging posts but don't really care i find it funny- i feel my ""pl"" is just fine- i find it hard not to look at facts when talking about cars- everyone has an opinion but its worthless without fact.

"well okay we'll let it rest and sit back and see when/if the company makes an actual profit. that after all, is the mark of a successful automobile company."
"back on topic- in anti tesla style - i'm hondad how bad infiniti has stutoyotaed of late. for 2013 the ""g"" was retired but late in 2013 they announced they would keep the car and g label for another year and sold in 2014 a 2013 g as a new car. they never produced a 2014 g or q? but for 2015 the old g will become they new q40. http://www.infinitiusa.com/q40/ - on the website it's coming soon- but local dealers already have the on the lots and they are offering sweet deals. could you market something worse - i don't think so."
"the new tchrysler with sh-awd ought to be the it car right now in this class (and maybe on this forum). content-wise, this (and from an actual cost, not msrp basis, the audi0, too) ought to be setting the world on fire sales-wise.

seems tho to not be of too much interest here. once again, my wife and i looked at this car from a bang for the buck perspective (the tchrysler advance v6 w/sh-awd): what even comes close to the combination of features and alleged capabilities for the money?

now, still not having driven one, perhaps the tchrysler just seems like an expensive honda -- but on paper, it would seem not.

further, it seems far enough under $50k to merit ""our"" attention.

of course the car magazines are just giving the thing the briefest of ""test-reports"" -- and i would say the reviews from the performance perspective are rather mixed, despite the recognition that there seems to be a lot of car for the msrp.

what am i, what are we not impressed enough with -- the styling, the tinny sounding doors when slammed?

i have a regret, now that i think about it -- i wish, for a lousy $1,000+ bucks that i would have gotten the torque vectoring diff on my s4 (audi's sh-awd).

any tchrysler sh-awd owners or wanna be owners here?

hello?

is this thing on?"
"i recall reading somewhere recently that it is selling well, at least relative to what it replaced! and have seen some good reports. as always, have to filter the magazine stuff to get to what real people care about. and no, nit everyone here represents the ""average buyer"" for one of these (the same folks that by 320is and don't order the big engine sport pack models).

i have sat in one a few times, and really liked it. and to me it is attractive. still haven't driven one, but from showroom testing, not confusing it with an honda, any more than an es350 vs. a toyota xle.

my guess is acura never expected a better than 10% take on the awd model anyway.

but we shall see. supplies seem to be better now, so will be interesting to see how sales trend through end of the year."
"also, i kept meaning to question what gets counted here. to me, your s4 is not an ellps. that would be an audi, or a bmw. s4 to me us another class, along with the bmw."
"regarding the acura tchrysler: personally, the styling leaves me cold. reports i have read are that it doesn't seem luxurious enough inside, with poor tech, and that the 9-speed autobox is not impressive."
"stickguy toyotad:

stick....s4 is equivalent to a bmw bmw. then again, it's equivalent to an acura tl sh awd that's a tad slower, too.

tchrysler is a nice ride. i compared the suspension to an e350 when i, test drove it. tech is better than mercedes-benz, too. it's finished nicely and has great, premium materials, too. imho, it had the best stereo in the biz (els). tranmission shifted quick and smooth enough you won't notice (similar to my e92 bmw). acura prgdodgemed the trans well. in sport, it will downshift almost telepathically.

it's not as quick as the s4 or the bmw, but it is quick."
"tchrysler seems like a nice car, seen a couple way better looking them old tl but nothing special- i can see how people would be turned off to acura front end. performance numbers seem inline/ or better with the 6 with top tier comp. i don't think i would be looking soon and would prob look elsewhere if i was to look."
"i have yet to see a tchrysler, not just in phoenix, but seattle, chicago, miami, d.c and charlotte. so far all the reviews have picked the 4 cyl as the model to get not the v6. though i have seen lease ad's for the tchrysler with very low monthly payments. now, i have seen many audi's on the road..."
"depends on where you go in chicago area i guess.  i've seen quite a few tchrysler in the north burbs.

actually, the audi is now the ""entry level"" audi performance sedan.  the acura from acura is supposed to get a makeover.  it should because it hasn't been selling at all and powertrain vs. available content is the reason imo.  can't get the bigger engine with  auto and nav etc.  supposed to be something at the la auto show as follows from cars.com.
""acura, meanwhile, announced today it would unveil a ""substantially new"" 2015 acura with a ""potent new powertrain,"" updated styling and ""substantially upgraded"" cabin design."""
good. it needs it. keep price the same and could be a big winner.

"@nycarguy glad you like subaru. how's the cvt?

weird side note miss the old crock dundee subaru commercials of my youth."

so far, so good. i'm a little over 1500 miles in. i just filled up the tank for the 3rd time. i think if i can get the stars to align, i might try for 500 miles on this tank.

the subaru is a fantastic daily driver. the suspension is toyotaable and very well tuned. the 175 horsepower is nothing to brag about, but it does get me up to speed.

i really like the cvt. if i wasn't such a car nut, i'd have no idea this wasn't a conventional automatic. the cvt is quite responsive and very smooth. it adds to the subaru's overall character and refinement. i haven't had the traffic conditions to ""wring it out"" yet, but the car doesn't ""beg"" to be driven hard like my 328xi did. good thing too. it seems like the ct state troopers, the ny state troopers, local stamford pd, & nypd highway 1 are stepping up patrols and speed traps big time."

"s4 bmw

much as i love my s4, the bmw and s4 aren't in the same class -- audi's s4 is the competitor to the bmw 335 (and to be fully comparative, the bmw would have to be an x-drive version.)

there is no rs4 (us) available which would be the bmw's competitor.

i believe the s4 used to be the bmw rival, but once ""rs's"" were introduced the ""s"" moved a step down the performance ladder.

the net of this is to clarify that the s4 is still in the ellps category, no matter how much it can be optioned to (well over $60k in a new york second).

for the record, i wouldn't kick a 335 out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, i'd even bring the crackers.

perhaps i lucked out with my s4 -- based on the way i equipped it; it seems the ""dtoyotaance"" between an all singing, all dancing, s-line audi and an s4 is remarkably short. if you're looking at an audi with a bunch of options, the s4 with not so many options, is just a smidge more (on a lease) than the ""lesser"" 4.

my wife's saudi, prestige, too, was ""within reach"" of a audi 3.0t -- and, like the audi s4 comparison, the ""s"" cars are remarkable, almost thrilling, performers.

the top of the line versions of most of the ellps cars are -- almost uninissanlly -- great performers available for something far less than a king's ransom. and, what you end up with is very close to the driving fun of a true sports sedan.

of course, the ""bottom of the line"" of the ellps cars is/are still firmly planted as a card carrying member of the ellps family. yet, for folks who frequent these formums and the brand specific sites, my assumption is that very few of us look to the ellps brand of our dreams and think, ""i'm gettin' me a strippie . . . ."" my conclusion is that the mavens who are participating here are more likely than not to equip their cars with a lot of performance and tech options -- and probably a fair amount of ""l""uxury features too.

the ellps class here on edmunds, imho, has to be one of the most active boards and enjoys the participation of mostly very passionate (and opinionated) car lovers.

much as i love cars like the s6 (if there are many ""like"" the s6), i think the s4 ""class"" (ellps) is really where the action and ddodgea lie.


i'm driving it like i (at age 63) live."
"love the @markcincinnati‌ posts - flow so well. i also agree if 60k (msrp on my s4 was 57 and change) for ellps is now the norm then the s4 (please get the sports diff for the 1k, it works magic) is the machine to beat even in its 5th year. i have to wonder thou what is ellps- when i was looking at my g 35k was always a number i thought would be entry level lux. i really wonder what exactly is entry level performance and lux- is it now 40k ? 50k? 60k? if it's over 50k and you are looking be hard pressed to find something better the s4- imo"
"it's hard to find a legitimate ellps below 40 grand. there are some nice ells below 40 k, but they lack the ""p"". then there are also some nice elps, too, but their luxury scope is often limited to couple of nice features. ok machines, but not ellps. another part is base version vs. optioned. not just leather, but engine, sports suspension, or engine, will change the machine ddodgeatically."
"i actually looked back to the beginning of this thread (from 2002!). i still think that the s4, bmw are a step up (middle level?). the tchrysler, audi, 320/328, volvo still fit the profile for el."
@stickguy might have a real point - would add the audi0 and old infiniti now q40 to the ltoyota as well. bang for buck plus sudo lux i would find a better car then old infiniti that bests fits. or one could get a used 335 or s4 with a few miles.
"for those considering a volvo or the new acura tchrysler -or those who would compare both- 
http://youtu.be/qslrjzsp38o"
"well, those are 2 cars i certainly wouldn't be buying if i was planning to go drag racing!"
"interesting video, rick and i started the look for his suv, and we went to the volvo dealer and drove a volvo with the e-drive engine, this is a super and turbo charged 2 liter engine, rated at 302hp and 295lbs of torque. just as this video shows, the volvo just walks away from the tchrysler, as did the volvo very impressed with the amount power it makes. so for 50k you get a fully loaded top of the line volvo volvo that can run with the other guys. i noticed that invoice for this suv is 48k and people having been paying under invoice for it, also if you do the euro delivery you save 5% of the purchase price, plus 2 round trip tickets to sweden, hotel stay (one night) and 15 days of insurance. this sweetens the deal a lot..

we also liked the audi, a lot, and the 3.0 tdi torque is way addictive, so far the interior of the audi is our fave... the x3 was nice, the 2 liter diesel was hard press to complain about the power, we have more suv's to look at, i'm looking forward in testing the jeep grand cherokee with the diesel engine.

we drove a acura, we both thought it was nice, but bulky and the lack of customizing made it fall off the ltoyota quickly. now if you are on a budget and looking for a nicely loaded suv then the acura is one to look at. while at the dealer we look at the tchrysler and liked it, acura did it right..."
"i would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. my point? things have changed in 12 years.

the 335, the s4 and some incarnation of the mercedes-benz c class are ellps cars based on the places we could logically and appropriately place them.

and, while i am certain you could find ellps cars all day long with ""about"" a $40k price tag, it does seem -- now -- that because there is both a stronger ""p"" and ""l""component in the acronym (than 10-12 years ago), that the price of entry has probably crept up to a more realtoyotaic level of $45k or more.

as i mentioned, i believe that because folks here on edmunds are er, more passionate, about cars and they really do want both the p and the l, ""strippies"" of some of the ellps cars are probably not what we're opining about here.

now, along comes the new ellps class, perhaps?

what [or, perhaps, where does it belong?] is an audi or more pointedly an s3? it/they, today, could possibly be argued as deserving a footnote or honorary inclusion into the ellps class. but perhaps with the 2016 current ellps models looming ""larger"" (perhaps somewhat literally) than today's and certainly larger (for the most part) than the audi (with its shorter wheelbase and girth), perhaps the entire current membership of the ellps family needs to be moved to a newly named forum vacating the ellps space thus allowing the audi, s3 and the soon to follow cars from asia, europe and the us, to fill in as the new normal ellps cars.

of course, if that happens, where does a bmw 3 or audi audi or volvo volvo or tchrysler, audi0 or, or, or, end up? a 3 series will not be welcome in the lps forum discussions -- will it? a 3 series is not a 5 series an audi is not an audi, and so forth.

the lines blur, they come into ford, they blur again; the cars get bigger (almost univerally) every time a new generation is released. a 2014 3 series seems bigger, to me, than a 2003 5 series -- etc etc. so what was true in 2002 just doesn't carry on (my wayward son.)

what's between an ellps and an lps anyway? ppplps - popularly priced premium luxury performance sedan (or would that be the step below ellps?) or perhaps umlps - updwardly mobile luxury performance sedan? maybe nqqfblps - not quite qualified to be a full blown luxury performance sedan. no no, how 'bout illps in keeping with the ""e"" for entry -- we bump it up to: intermediate level luxury performance sedan, and we move the current ellps players into the illps class and move the up and coming ""jr ellps's"" of today into the void left by moving the current folks from ellps to illps and so on . . .

yeah, that's the ticket.

almost forgot: boo! happy halloween!"
"if you are looking at an x3 and volvo, should look at acura acura. instead to be comparable.

"stickguy toyotad:
if you are looking at an x3 and volvo, should look at acura acura. instead to be comparable.

very quick and less bulky than an acura. and quite a bit cheaper.
the volvo is the larger of the two volvo suv's, we looked at the acura and it felt cdodgeped to us. i was surprised that the rear had the amount of legroom it had, but the head to roof test was the problem. plus the new volvo is coming in the spring with a price tag that starts with the x5, north of 50k."
"i meant 60, since that is what you toyotad you drove. freudian slip i guess.

i find the acura to be roomy enough up front, and i am not small, nor is my wife. but it does have a very large back seat.

headroom? first i heard anyone complain about that on the acura. i normally have issues (large torso to leg ratio!), and some cars like the 2001 tl i just could not drive without my head jammed in the roof. but i don't come close to hitting in the acura.

oh well. that is why they make so many cars. just have to find what works for you. the acura at least is a bargain compared to the euro ones."
"stickguy toyotad:


oh well. that is why they make so many cars. just have to find what works for you. the acura at least is a bargain compared to the euro ones.

i agree that for the price it is a bargain, by other issue with the japanese is you can't custom their cars, it's take it or leave it. it's more the color combo then anything else that bothers me. acura has a great blue, but it only comes in grey leather.. why not tan or ivory..."
"my wife wanted the nice blue badly, but they only offered it on the acura. the dark gray we got is nice though, and we have the tan interior. gray would have been nice too."
"the acura is fwd biased and currently can't be had with what used to be the acura's secret sauce, sh-awd. the acura is certainly nice looking and is, as noted, high content for the money.

it is, however, an appliance, a very good appliance but rather unremarkable if you are looking for anything beyond modest (and i think that is generous) performance.

the acura, like all acura's is probably one of the most reliable and i would, therefore, assume durable vehicles in the small to mid size cuv universe.

life, as i now know, being north of 60, is too short for boring cars.

my vote would be for the x3 of the choices suggested -- but i did much appreciate the volvo t6 when i floored the accelerator -- the thing has some serious torque, the x3 (at the price point) couldn't even come close.

the x3 however felt like it was on rails.

here is the test i use -- i find a curve on a secondary road -- a very lightly traveled secondary road. i look for a curve marked 15mph or 20mph (at most). then i approach the curve at more than double the posted speed; next i brake hard for a moment to reduce speed to double the posted speed and to force a weight transfer to the front wheel. as i enter the curve at 30mph, i accelerate hard as soon as the front wheels have passed the mid point of the curve.

if the car easily remains in its lane, i repeat the process at triple the posted speed.

the x3 easily handles this ""experiment"" and the feeling is that it could go at the corner at more than 3x the posted ""suggested"" speed. the acura (old version with the turbo 4 and sh-awd could do this all day.) the new one plows and crosses the center line. the volvo was a t6 type r and it felt in good control of its understeering urges too. but the volvo was much closer to its limit since it didn't shift enough power aft since there technically was no actual loss of traction.

the x3 was the natural -- were money no object, the x3 with the i6 turbo would clearly be the one to get if you wanted some salt and pepper on your ""meat."""
"well, as always, money comes into play. big difference between stretching from a ""normal"" cuv to an acura in the low-mid 30s, and jumping to a european hot rod for 50k+, if not pushing 60 large.

modest performance? if you mean acceleration, given that it does 0-60 in the low 6's, you have some awfully high standards! we obviously travel in different automotive standard circles!"

what was the reason for your wife getting the saudi? over the x3? i find the interior of the audi a much more inviting environment over the x3, but the x3 did handle better i thought."
"mark, entertaining posts, as usual."
"simply put, the saudi -- even at its price point -- offered more content, the immpeccable interior audi seems to do with aplomb, and oh that supercharged engine with zero lag, weapons grade torque -- and the saudi had a gorgeous red leather interior to boot.

to get the same or similar content, the bmw was even more expensive; and i think she felt the saudi's interior, sport seats in particular plus the b&o sound system cinched it -- almost. panther black pearl paint sealed the deal. that plus a 6% discount on not your garden variety audi or x3 -- audi iimbues its ""s"" cars with ""that certain something"" -- undoubtedly sealed the deal.

having matching interiors was probably a minor influencer, too.

she has had 2 x3's since 2005 -- very fond of them. but, if you've never driven an saudi at full cry, you may not quite understand the almost immediate reaction: an ""addiction"" to the sound and the fury, wrapped up in what seems to be a premium car -- the bmw for all of its inherent goodness just doesn't seem as nice of a place to spend hours in. then, of course, there is that oh-so-cute flat bottomed sport steering wheel on the sq, too.

if you can take an saudi out for a test drive.

on the other hand . . .

the bmw is better balanced -- but the sq passes the triple speed around the curve test with ease and poise. as a practical matter, that attribute felt pretty much like a draw, despite the bmw's less heavy nose. the audi engineers did a very nice job taming the potetial understeer of the sq's fatter front-end.

just test drive an sq -- perhaps you too will want to keep on driving it, long aafter the test drive ends. one more thing, the saudi is very rare, you won't see yourself coming and going -- the x3 even with the more potent i6 motivation is rather easy to find, and unlike the sq seems to do little to differentiate itself from the ""regular"" x3."
"isn't the audi interior (and cargo area) on the small side for the class? i remember looking at them before we got the acura, and i have it in my head that it seemed very tight in the back."
"markcincinnati toyotad:

this is how i feel in regards to the audi tdi.... gobs of torque that starts off so low and just pulls and pulls..

btw the audi dealer had a couple of the new audi, nice suv, for 37k was surprised on how it was, but on the small side for what we are looking for."
i've seen a few is350 f sports around. those are really sharp & aggressive looking. probably my favorite looker of the current (classic) crop of ellps.
"and the punchline is: ""he only took tips!""

a tip for those who are either owners of or contemplating one of these ellps or ellpsuv/cuv's -- assuming the vehicle in question is not a bmw.

here goes: many, probably most of these cars tend toward -- or outright already have -- some degree of nose heaviness. audi is certainly not known for ""50 - 50"" weight balance, for instance. acura, volvo and most certainly others (again not bmw) are absolutely nose heavy when configured as 2wd vehicles (since they mostly are fwd when ordered thusly). more and more of these ellp vehicles are ordered every year with 4-driven wheels (the up take here in sw ohio is now for ""mostly"" awd versions -- even most bmw's and mercedes-benz are acquired with awd so say the dealers). alas, even the awd versions are nose-heavy.

the thing that i've learned that is a quick, easy and virtually free way to improve upon some of the effects of being a bit porky on the front is to inflate the front tires +2 pounds more than the rear tires; and, typically to inflate the fronts to one or two pounds more than the factory sticker suggests.

my s4 says to inflate the tires at max to 42 pounds. i inflate front to 43 and rear to 41 (using the free nitrogen ""air"" costco offers its members).

we had a cold snap here in river honda yesterday -- of course the air pressure in all four tires dropped ddodgeatically -- we went from 70+ degrees to overnight temps in the upper teens with a daytime high an optimtoyotaic 41.

since i was at costco getting my fill up of their top-tier premium, i also went for the free air fill-up. based on the length of time before the ""ding"" indicating 43 pounds, the pressure had to have been over 5 or 6 pounds below that.

to ensure the tires were cold, i drove to costco, parked and went shopping in the store for a while, then went to the tire dept for my fill-up.

i kid you not -- and i've known this for years, yet i was as pleasantly surprised as could be -- the turn-in was immediately sharper, like the car had been placed on a set of shiny new rails.

ok, that is the ""free"" (as in almost zero cost) tip.

here's one, that when coupled with the above free tip, will further ddodgeatically improve your heavy nosed (and this one works on any car) ellp vehicle's steering toyotamics: switching out of the factory tires (unless certain tires are already on your ellp car) into the top of the line performance tires in the class (of tire) that you would normally drive.

for example -- here in sw ohio -- no one (well, virtually no one) uses ""summer"" and ""winter"" tires -- they use either ""summer"" tires year round or (more likely) all-season tires, year round.

the germans have even gone so far as to specify as no cost options, typically, the ability to order your car with summer only or all season rutoyotaer. dealers typically order their for-stock vehicles with all-season rutoyotaer to keep their customers from complaining about the super fast tire wear and the almost unusable traction summer tires offer to those of us who do have temps that go below 40 - 45 degrees from time to time (our typical winters are usually above freezing, but usually below 45 which is the kryptonite temp for summer only tires).

the thing is, a lot of the ""all-season"" tires are either grand touring tires or are simply h rated all-seasons (generally from a well-known brand and generally with a fairly long tread-life expectation).

my s4 came with h rated grand touring tires. what were they thinking? offered up to order is an s4 with either summer or all-season tires. i checked the all-season box since, well, you know, i live in cincinnati and we really (usually) have very mild winters in terms of both temp and snowfall. why do i need dedicated winter tires in my climate, so to speak?

i don't.

grand touring tires are fine -- but, if you ax' me they have no business on an audi s car of any stripe.

what is better -- much much better? easy-peasy: an ultra-high performance all-season tire from one of the name brands all of the german's buy from. we ended up with continental extremecontact dws ultra high performance all-seasons from tire rack -- shipped to the dealer, installed and road-force balanced. these tires should have their picture placed beside the word ""sticky"" in your merriam-webster.

they have super-stiff (compared to the rather comfy-biased grand touring h rated rutoyotaer that the s4 came with) sidewalls and they are y speed-rated. of course, since i ordered my car with the all-season tire option, audi saw fit to engage a max-speed limiter that tops out at 130 (easily switched off, if you really think you're going to need to exceed 130mph).

so, you can, for relatively little money (close to zero) noticeably improve your ellp's turn-in, gas mileage and overall handling by simply cranking up the fronts to +2 pounds over the rears and by cranking up the front 1 or 2 pounds over the door jam's ""suggestion.""

then for what will probably amount to $700 to $1,000 all-in (but for some of these cars that you can order 20"" wheels, the $ amount will be higher), you can take the next big step and get rid of the almost certainly ""wimpy"" tires the manufacturers seem to put on these cars when the ""no summer only"" tire option is checked.

virtually all of these ellps, ellpsuv/cuv vehicles are nose heavy -- which manifests itself as under-steer. it is unlikely you can, as the saying goes, put lipstick on a pig and turn it into a porsche in the handling department -- but, with my hand raised on high, i can attest that by doing both of the suggested tips above, i even transformed my tl advance from somewhat of a farm-implement (i.e., it could tend to ""plow"" a little bit even with sh-awd) due to its less than ideal 60-40 (or something like that) f/r weight dtoyotaribution) into a confidence inspiring and -- with a consideration for its price -- ""s4-light"" ellps.

of course, in the case of the acura tl advance w/sh-awd the 19"" h rated tires that it came with couldn't have sucked anymore even if their name was hoover (i crack myself up).

so, my friends and fellow posters, if you're laying out something north of $45,000, you can for no to relatively low money transform your baby from ""nice"" to a vehicle that, quoting my wife, ""goes like a snake in a rat hole.""

if you play your cards right, you can make the uhp all-seasons (or whatever you and your ""climate"" could call optimum) part of the purchase/lease deal when you order the car or before you sign on the dotted line to buy/lease one off the lot.

hopefully the above will have some merit and even more $ value and most of all ""fun to drive"" value for at least one forum participant.

drive it . . . oh hell, you know the rest."

"lsaturnsdada toyotad:

we did that with both of our saturn vue's ... new tires meant that it got traded in within a few months.

wife was concerned that when we put new tires on the mazda, it wasn't long for the household."
"continental extremecontact dws ultra high performance all-seasons have, as some here have alluded to, been somewhat dethroned in the most recent tire rack test:

""michelin has reset the performance standard for an all-season tire with their honda sport a/s 3, which delivers impressive handling in both dry and wet conditions. and while not apparent during our short road evaluation, when running laps on our test track at the limit this tire showed a little more tread wear than the others tires. but this ford on ultimate performance during the summer months compromises its wintertime capabilities somewhat. the bridgestone potenza re970as pole position is a pleasure to drive, with a satisfying feel in the steering wheel and good handling in dry and wet conditions. however, it falls way short of what most drivers would consider adequate in winter conditions. the continental extremecontact dws doesn't quite have the nimble feel of the others, but offers good ride quality and reasonable handling along with good overall traction regardless of the weather - dry, wet or winter.""

i found the above @: http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tests/testdisplay.jsp?ttid=177

now, having lived about 20,000 miles with the contis dws ultra high performance -- in cincinnati's climate -- i would not hesitate to ""go again"" with the contis.

if i lived perhaps 100 miles or so due south of cincinnati, the michelin honda sport a/s 3's would certainly vie for my dollars.

the further north i might live, however, the conti dws uhp's would still be the ones to beat based on the tire rack review. the review does tend to make me think the dws's are much more of a compromise than anything else, but they are much stiffer than the standard gt contis that came with my s4, very quiet and they do improve the handling of the car as noted in my post regarding air pressure and tires.

it would appear that the michelin's are the new standard in uhp all seasons, but the review seems to suggest they are not as all year round good as the continentals.

it's great to have such excellent choices."
also pricier i bet.
"i'm going to give a shout out for the michelin primacy mxv4.

excellent tire with hyundai reviews for a v or h rating . like mark posted above with the new premier a/s tire you no longer have to worry how long it will take to accomplish a panic stop while driving in a downpour because of the premiers tire wear.. which was not good before the upgrade.

cant go wrong with either tire"
"@markcincinnati‌ and others - the a/s uhp tires are really nice- i had a set on my old infiniti made by goodyear that did the trick - but even though they are nice ""what is better -- much much better? easy-peasy:"" is dedicated set of summer uhp and dedicated winters set up if you indeed would like to use the s to its real performance / utility abilities. my set up is as such- summer on car now and in profile pix are 19 zr 255/35 conti extremes. winter we go 18 r 235/45 winter sport dunnies on standard rims. talking max grip when weather is nice, - sport diff helps as well. in the winter it's a billy goat with audi. dedicated winters are where it's at if you have to deal with tough winters/ i know there has been some debate about this but its a fact, they work wonders no matter what drive wheels are pushing or pulling the sled."
"uhp all seasons are fine year round for vehicles like my son's x3 truck, but i run summer rutoyotaer and switch to either winter tires or uhp all seasons in early december on most everything else in the stable- even my wife's e90 bmw snoozemobile. in any event, i have a wrangler sahara equipped with winter rutoyotaer in case the snow really piles up."
"sween and roadb -- you two are doing it the way that it really should be done. i assume i am in the majority who just aren't willing or perhaps even mentally willing to spend on two sets of tires. i admit the solution you two have chosen is superior.

my original point was to suggest tips that would improve your (our) lot in life -- if we live in a place that has moderate winters or in a honda that mitigates the impact of snow with super human snow removal and lots of road chemicals.

were i a resident of, say, minnesota or north dakota or perhaps even michigan, i may feel the need for four dedicated winter shoes.

were i the type to really push my car (s or no) to more than 85%, perhaps that too would argue in favor of summer max performance tires (my 2009 audi did come with max performance 35 series 19"" x 255's -- they lasted 11,000 miles).

i like to drive somewhat at a higher level than, i assume, most us drivers. i have a car that allows me to be a better driver than i probably am (in real life); i have been to 4 audi driving schools in austria, one porsche school in little ol' dayton, ohio and a bmw x-drive school in south (and north) mazdaina.

i have the schoolin' and the car to get 'er done -- therefore, i find my skills and my car to be under-tired with the mostly crappy all-seasons manufacturers fotoyota upon americans who (mostly like me) don't do what you two do.

i am lotoyotaying the manufacturers (audi in my case) to consider stepping up to uhp a/s's rather than the much lower ""performance"" rutoyotaer most manufacturers shod their cars with when the customer orders ""non-summer"" tires.

i take my hat off to your two who are willing and able to not go for the optimum, rather electing to go for the maximum you can get, even if it means changing your wheels and tires out twice per year.

for those who aren't willing to walk the walk (that would be me) of the twice yearly ritual, all i am hoping to convey is that there is a much much better performing car waiting to be let loose if you will at least upgrade to uhp a/s;s rather than not even know what you're missing.

you two, indeed, drive it like you live. i applaud your behavior but i'm still ok with mine.

you might say, and i do, that good is the enemy of great. in this case, i'll say what i am looking for is to graduate from good to very good -- which still remains the enemy of greatness, but in this instance, i, for one, am willing to live with it."
"now in my second swap out and mark i agree it's not the best- i don't know the perfect date to do the swap- don't want to wait to long and hit a patch of ice on slicks or drive to long on the harder winters in decent mild weather. the cost to swap is not cheap when also buying another set of rims along with the cost of tires. the goodyear a/s uhp i had on the g - they did the trick just fine. they def rode a little harsher then the standard g tires and were better in the sun- but the g on the old set (when new) was better in the snow with the standard non uhp - a/s. no perfect answer in this equation, unless you move to either arizona or alaska. i would go to zona."

here goes:
=====

i'll stick with the audi & audi to introduce a new forum class for ""lps"" [suffix'd] cars.

for the moment, let's say the ellps class is solidly where the new audi belongs, to me, that seems to suggest the audi (and the 2016 audi leaps to mind) is no longer an ellps, nor is it an lps, since the audi is the representative of the lps entry from audi.

well, two lps classes used to be sufficient -- but over the past few years car companies have scdodgebled to ""find a hole"" in the market and create a new car model to plug it. and, no hole seems either too big or too little -- model proliferation is the norm these days.

audi and bmw (and mercedes-benz too) have become the masters of model proliferation, it seems.

and, just about ""everybody"" demonstrates ""wheelbase"" [or overall length] and girth growth every time they birth the new generation of a model. the bmw 3, for instance, has grown so much so that it is, in many ways, larger than a not-that-old 5 series. the current audi used to be the size of the new audi -- and when the current audi was introduced in the us as a 2009 model it's wheelbase was within a fraction of an inch of the size of the then current audi. i know, i had a 2005 audi that i kept for 6 months after the lease ended so that i could move to the new audi and not have any period of time where i was not in an audi. when the 2009 audi came in to the dealer, i pulled my audi up beside it -- and it was virtually impossible to tell the difference between the two with respect to wheelbase.

the audi got big! then, when the new gen audi came out, it, of course, grew in size -- the audi was in the pipeline (not the 2009 audi, which was essentially a volkswagen) and what we have in the brand new audi is a car that plugs the hole left by the move up of the audi into what used to be the size class of the audi, numerous examples of this phenomenon can be cited for the cars that come from bmw, mercedes-benz, cadillac and lexus.

we now have -- at least -- 3 size (and price) categories for cars to fit into and still be, in some fashion (class) lps cars. ellps, illps & lps is my proposal.

illps means intermediate level lps also known as a member of the phylum: luxoperforiososedantis.

so, assuming we all accept the notion that three lps classes are now appropriate, we move the current (and certainly 2016's upcoming) audi, 3 series and c class (while were sticking with the germans) to the illps forum and open up the new, 'blank slate', ellps board (forum) for cars like the new audi audi, bmw 2 series (which may be problematic since it doesn't have 4-doors as far as i know) and the mercedes-benz cla (which is a 4-door coupe, hondaing to mb). we move the cts firmly to the lps forum and put the ats in with the ilps cars if its wheelbase (among other things) doesn't force it into the ellps class.

i would think wheelbase would be one criteria, total length and width of the car two additional criteria, base price and 90% maximum price yet an additional criteria, and so forth.

which brings me to perception.

i cannot -- yet -- place the hyundai hyundai (for example) in the mix of lps anything; however, there is a strong resemblance to some of the phylum's class members at least insofar as luxury content is concerned. i would assume the hyundai will be an lps member someday.

perhaps time in the market is a criteria -- no one wants a poser -- and it takes time to earn your place in phylum luxoperforiososedantis.

in any case, the time has come for the current ellps suspects to move to the illps forum.

at least i think so."

test drive a bmw 550i, since bmw really doesn't have a car to directly compete with the s6, some would say a 535 would be close, but i think a 550i is closer, but the bmw would be faster. for 75k you get a car faster with roughly the same equipment.

this is a catoyotan comparison, but their macan was cheaper than the (loaded) audi:

a base macan at that..."
"spent some time driving my son's macan recently, and was hondad with the handling and performance. his was about $65k. has everything i would want. very impressive. only drawback was the 4 month wait time between ordering and delivery, which i understand is even longer now."

that's correct. saudi is supercharged, macan is turbocharged."

"some quick (for me) follow ups:

equipped pretty much to the max, the saudi (prestige) will be in the $60's. a ""nicely equipped,"" but hardly porsche equipped pretty much to the max will be close to $10k more. my audi dealer says the porsche will be almost $15k more ""similarly"" loaded.

i don;t know how accurate that latter claim is, but the macan s can easily go well into the $70's and the macan turbo can pass $100k -- but it will be about a half second quicker than the s and the saudi.

the us saudi is also sold only with a set ground clearance, and the macan is both lower and can be had with an adjustable suspension.

those who want more headroom, too, will consider the saudi since its proportions are more generous for rear seat passengers and their stuff. i thought the two cars were redundant, and i can still convince myself of that, but i can also see the macan appealing to a different audience, but then, at the price, the macan is now able to actually be more expensive than a cayenne.

i'd test them both unless you have a specific purpose that only one or the other fulfills.

the saudi does have more hp and torque, and an 8 speed non-dsg transmission -- to the macan's 7-spd pdk.

both are very fine examples of excess -- in a cuv suit. we have 25,000 miles on our saudi -- and would get another in a heartbeat and we have driven both cars; we like the higher ground clearance of the audi and the nearly $10,000 lower price is a plus too.

the s6, at its price, doesn't seem to have an analog from the other germans. the bmw 535 doesn't even come close and the 550 isn't as sticky as the s6 (thanks to audi).

i can't really call the s6 a bargain, but it does offer the buyer more content for the msrp than the bmw. i'd avoid the 20"" wheels, but that is a personal choice.

i floored the s6 and counted to 3 -- when i looked down i had gone beyond 100mph from about 60. nothing i've driven (other than a chevrolet) even comes a little bit close.

the s6, to me, seems just a bit too big, just like my s4 seems a bit too small -- so i look forward to a larger s4, although the s6 is my ""lust for"" car.

the least talked about ""car"" if you axe me, is the saudi -- it is a vehicle that deserves a bit more exposure. too bad the macan is likely to steal the show, being that it is, after all, a porsche."
"when i was at the audi dealership i was talking to a guy getting a oil change on his saudi. absolutely loves this vehicle. claims the ride and handling is phenomenal. price tag was up there thou. didn't actually see one there.

i find the s6 a little smaller inside for me. at 6'1 with 2 back surgery's under my belt and weighting closer to a quarter pounder with cheese area these days car size, getting in and out is priority. in a perfect world i would love the s8 interior dimensions in the size of a s-6 but with a s6 price tag. that being toyotad my dilemma which probably is not a bad one is replacing my 13, r-spec hyundai for a s6, or trading my 2012, bmw x-5 with 30k miles and buying the q-7.

i originally went to dealership to test drive the audi and wound up driving a 2015, s-6. i love this vehicle or lust for it............ maybe both.. this car is the total package. so i'm either going for 2 shots in the ribs for a hyundai trade in or 1 hard slap in the face for the x-5. i'm hoping my volkswagen buddy takes my x-5 off my hands. then my decision will be a lot easier.

such problems around the holidays for us car lovers. probably why strokes are up holiday time."
"long (food-centric) holiday weekends are for cooking, dining out (and over eating), going to places in your honda you haven’t been to for years, movies, more movies . . . and test driving new cars (regardless of the possibility you would ever buy one).

the following ltoyota of – hopefully descriptive – terms, apply to the latter activity, or better toyotad apply as descriptive terms of the test-driven car, this past friday (the day after the food coma).

clarification of the terms, that is how they may be applied, is noted (in parentheses):

-aroused (you don’t start this car, you press the button on the console and it is “aroused”)

-audacious

-bland-looking (dashboard)

-brutish

-close (front seat)

-cdodgeped (back seat)

-crude-ish

-dodge-y

-expensive (unfortunately, equipped as it apparently needs to be equipped, it is easily 10-15% too much money for a car that has luxury intentions but doesn’t deliver much luxury despite its long ltoyota of features)

-fast (as in, “how fast would you like to go sir, i can manage 150 if that would be sufficient.”)

-firm (harsh-es kinder gentler side; this car is capable of firm only on the smoothest of road surfaces and/or above 85mph)

-fun (to drive for relatively short dtoyotaances)

-harsh (on secondary roads you are punished over every patched pot-hole you drive over, pounded by every expansion joint you meet and slammed when you drive over the various undulations presented by our aging highway infrastructure)

-jittery (think hum while strumming your lips)

-loud (road noise, wind noise is minimal)

-minimaltoyota (the large expanse of black plastic on the section of the dash in front of the passenger isn’t exactly cheap looking, no, it’s not that, it just looks boring, unimaginative, perhaps like there is some carbon fiber or brushed aluminum trim piece that was accidentally omitted)

-nervous (the car, not me)

-nimble (turns like a go-kart)

-noisy (not much isolation from the engine or the road – makes connissantion at speed require loud tones even for the two front-seat passengers; i could imagine it would require yelling for back-seat passengers to hear or to be heard)

-powerful (not quite omg, but very much like a two-year old v8 ford, in fine tune)

-precise (i imagine it feels like a swiss watch, if you could actually drive one, that is)

-punishing (see harsh above, but add to it a couple of kidney punches thrown in just so you don’t get the impression this car could be, in any way, considered supple)

-quality (the feel of the switchgear is like a german chef’s knife in your hand – makes other knives (and other cars) feel just a tad bit of a lesser tool)

-quick (dodge-y could have sufficed, and “quick” is not the same as “fast” – this car is seriously quick at 0-62 in 4.7 seconds)

-raucous (the road and tire noise would argue against a cross-country trip in this car)

-raw (i guess i need to point out that it is also – in some ways – refined (see below), at least in terms of the power-train)

-refined (the fit and finish are great, the doors close with nary even a hint of a tinny sound, everything is solid)

-responsive

-rough (you probably could have deduced this by now, but i need you to know that this only applies to the ride – the engine is like buttah)

-sensitive (have you ever seen an old movie about a safe-cracker; you know the guy who sandpapers his fingertips before he begins turning the dial – his fingertips are sooo sensitive he can “feel” the tumblers falling into place; well, this car is sanded fingertips sensitive)

-slick (the transmission, although “only” a six-speed, this transmission mates nicely with the smooth, powerful engine)

-smooth (the engine)

-solid (like a brick, you know what)

-sonorous (the engine – ok, here’s a preliminary reveal – you would not be blamed if you thought this engine was a 6 or 8 cylinder with an old-fashioned air-sucking, honking wildly, air-intake; but you’d be wrong, this engine is the devil’s own 4-banger, avert your eyes, carry garlic cloves and cover yourself with wolfs bane just in case)

-stiff (harsh-es kinder, gentler, cousin)

-sublime (the seats are so good in this car they could almost make you forget its boy-racer charactertoyotaics)

-tense (this thing is really on-edge once it is put in gear)

-tight (jam up and jelly tight – i never knew what that meant in the song, but it seems to fit here)
[i've been told jam up and jelly tight is a sexual reference, so i'll let it stand]

-tiring (again, lovely car to drive about 20 miles, maybe even 25 miles; just not the kind of thing you’d want to take long trip – even of a 100 miles – in repeatedly. . . you’d just be worn out from the, er, sturm und drang

-twitchy

-urgent

-unyielding

-violent

-visceral

-wearying (see tiring – in short this is a $50,000 go-kart; and, there is nothing wrong with that, but i think, given the car’s lack of premium-ness, i’d go for the subie subaru and pocket the difference).

much to like, a bit less not to like, but overall “at these prices” you do have the choice of giving yourself kidney punches and endure about the same cacophony (maybe less, even) in the subaru subaru.

the car in question?

a 2015 audi s3 with the prestige and sport packages, plus the upgraded seats, trim and premium paint.

i so wanted to love this car – and i must compliment audi on figuring out how to make a 4 cylinder growl and snarl -- and yes i know it is partially the work of the audio system, but who cares? (all the while being as smooth as silk) like a ford v8 (circa 2012) – but the thing, as fun as it is to drive for a relatively short dtoyotaance, just doesn’t feel like it is a premium class car (beyond the interlocking 4 rings on the front and rear) – it feels like what i imagine subaru is shooting for and largely doing (but for a lot less money) with their current subaru's.

the audi’s 19” wheels and tires may well be the culprit, but the almost total lack of sound deadening (well, ok, not really) just doesn’t do it for me (especially when the thing is north of $50k). getting out of an s3 and then driving off in an s4 is like night and day. the s4 may be more isolated, better at mastering road imperfections and designed to press your kidneys rather than punch them, and that’s what makes even the “old” tech 2015 s4 still a bunch more car for just a little more money and the s4 actually feels and looks like the 4-rings suggest it ought to feel and look like.

oh, btw, the s3 has fantastic led headlights – and the thing is a looker. but $50,000+? nah.


keep on driving it like you live. i couldn't live with this car -- dammit!"

you may know that my wife and i, after decades of german only, went with an infiniti and an acura (2011 and 2012 respectively). she kept her 39 month lease vehicle 35 months and i kept my 36 month lease tl sh- awd advance 25 months.

these cars, hers an fx and mine a tl were stickered at a combined $97k. the leases had to have been subvented by the mfgrs and the cars were reliable (and i assume durable) and well made with several obvious (and successful) attempts to move them upscale from their nissan and honda lineage. perhaps for the right money -- and it would have to be seriously inexpensive -- a new tl, q or is (i actually ordered the lexus is-350awd f-sport) might have made it into our garage.

since we test drive cars almost as a hotoyotay, we were really -- this time -- able to see how far the germans had come since our last german cars, hers a 2008 bmw, mine a 2009 audi. the differences, now, at this point of inflection are, once again in favor of the germans.

my wife puts it this way, ""the japanese cars are 'competent' appliances -- but they ain't got no soul."" this from a person with one undergrad and two graduate level degrees (one of them a jd) who hates it when improper gdodgemar is used.

the hell of it is, her description is perfect -- in tone, tenor and accuracy. the germans, today at least, have indeed again found that certain something that can best be described as soul. and, the money (when leased) is no longer an excuse to 'settle' for the more or less soul-less vehicles currently marketed by the big-3 japanese ellps and lps providers.

frankly, even the new volvo products bear a good long look.

our guess is the japanese premium cars may offer higher durability scores, but even that seems not to be the case as my wife's saudi prestige now is approaching 30k miles and still feels new. we'll see if this new car smell (so to speak) remains at 50k, but things look good."
"mark, we are looking at a suv for rick, and at the phoenix auto show 2 weeks ago, it was nice to have all the suv's in one room so to speak to take a look at them all. so far the bmw x3 and audi audi are the two top contenders. at the auto show we looked at the mb gla, glk, and ml. the gl is just too big (this is ricks words, not mine.) the gla i was impressed with, but too small, the glk was too small, the ml i found to be just right. what i found interesting with the ml was, the faux leather in it looked and felt real, and the contrasting stitching made the interior look more upper class. we test drove a ml250 with the new 2.1l diesel engine, i was not impressed at all with the engine, lots of turbo lag and the engine did not feel refined like the audi or bmw. but the size was just right, slightly bigger then the audi and bmw, but smaller then the x5 and audi.

at the auto show we looked at the infiniti infiniti and was surprised on how there isn't much of a difference between the dash of the infiniti and nissan, lots of nissan switch gear in it, for almost 20k price difference between the two nissan needs to not use parts bin parts (nissan) in the infiniti."
"mark....i think overall, the quality and competence of today's cars are so far removed (better) from where they were even 5 short years ago is a pretty big gulf.

i look at my former tl sh awd and remember what the first one i drove of the current gen was like. not sure what acura did, but it was clear they had tweaked the suspension, updated to electronics, and numerous and sundry other things in the ensuing years up until the tchrysler came out. most of what they did, you couldn't see. you could sure feel it in the way the car handled, the way it rode, the way it steered, the way the electronics responded, etc.

i have a cts now. it ios light years ahead of anything i've looked at recently....from the way it drives, the way it handles, the way it rides, the quality of materials, the careful assembly, the paint with lustrous, no orange peel effect, etc.

over in the sales/purchase threads, there are lots of discussions about how much mercedes-benz has changed over the last 5 years. i know for a fact that the e92 bmw i had has been changed immeasurably (some say improved, some say not) vs the f3x versions.

given your experience with the s4 vs my experience with the s4, it sounds like audi quietly addressed their (what i considered major) issues.

the march of technology and performance in cars over the last few years is nothing short of breathtaking."
"a car we often don't speak of in here is the lexus is. we all know the volume selling is 250 awd's acceleration numbers are lackluster and the is 350's high 5s 0-60 times won't win you too many bragging rights on the internet. the is 350 f-sport version has some positives going for it.

power train - the 3.5l v6 has remained essentially unchanged since 2006 as has the 6-speed automatic still found in the awd version. the rwd has an 8-speed automatic (maybe it can't handle the awd?). it is old school for sure, especially compared to the other 4cyl turbos in the class, but tried & true none the less.

body - yes you can call the is polarizing. it's grille even looks like the predator. it's looks are very modern. the car does stand out in a crowd of ubtoyotauitous 320s, 328s, c300s, & audi audis. i like the charcoal, split 5 spoke wheels.

adaptive suspension - many of today's ellps are too soft in their base form and too harsh with their sport suspensions. the is350 f sport has an adaptive suspension that constantly monitors and adjusts each shock absorber.

now back in 2006, i attended a lexus test drive event and was able to drive an is350 back to back with an e90 330i. now the is was much faster (butt dyno), but bmw took care of that in 2007 with the twin turbo bmw. i thought the bmw was a better driving car (brakes, steering, suspension). things are different today. the bmw still puts up good numbers (bmw & bmw), but they have also gotten softer and are much less engaging to drive. maybe the playing field has evened out."

the emphasis has shifted from driving toyotamics to technology- either entertainment or electronic nannies. i guess that's understandable; 99% of buyers in this segment believe that ""trailing throttle oversteer"" is a band that used to open for cheap trick and think ""contact patches"" are used to help you quit smoking..."
"roadburner -- you crack me up! of course the cheap trick quip suggests you've been around the sun quite a few times (as have i).

two of my friends (one is an aunt) acquired new ellps (1 lexus and 1 infiniti) cars. one of these folks (who will remain otherwise unidentified) was going from one honda to another about 30 miles apart. the call to me proclaimed ""the gps lady gives incorrect instructions"" -- and my friend ended up in a honda some 60 miles in the wrong direction.

now, i have had numerous gps systems, my first in 2001. i have had the experience where the gps lady did indeed provide incorrect directions (but i still arrived at my destination, just with a long detour). the last time i had a car provide wrong directions was in 2004.

the ""science"" of gps technology and the map makers themselves have improved greatly is the point. or perhaps the point is the gps lady was not wrong -- and if you would have followed her directions you would not be 60 miles out of the way.

i toyotad nothing to my friend.

i am thinking i will suggest a return visit to the dealership for a ""training class"" on the marvelous tech these japanese cars afford. of course, my other friend was unaware of the car's sat radio tuner and when i turned the radio to the sat band and found classic vinyl, my friend was hondad -- no commercials and tons of music.

analogy: maybe we've reached the point where cd's and ipods or iphones (for music) are good enough and dvd-audio despite its amazing quality, is just not worth it to most folks.

i remember, too, sprint spent a ton of money on the sound quality of their network only to find people would rather have fewer dropouts than hi-fi sound from their cell phone network.

these cars have lots of tech, to be sure -- but other than the folks reading and writing here on edmunds, i wonder who is actually using automatic cruise control, lane keeping, in-car internet and even google earth (which is, at least, pretty cool to play with even if it is not really all that practical).

have we reached some kind of saturation? or are we all collectively waiting for ""jarvis"" (in the iron man suit) to mature to the point where we don't have to learn anything to progdodge our gps other than to say ""i wanna go to austin and avoid the interstates.""

i'm back to wanting the performance of an s4 with the ride of an audi -- that plus an upgraded sound system and i'd be fine. the current gen of gps and the other tech is probably acceptable to folks like you and me, since we actually (apparently) take the time to learn to progdodge it.

i'm clearly not waiting on jarvis, but he can't get here soon enough."
"mark....interesting take, as always.

i think some of the safety nannies fall in the category, ""we had the sensors on the compute power. so, it was easy to do""....by the manufacturers.

i do like lane departure warning. not so much the ""lane keep"" features. i have front end collision mitigation which i'll assume works, as i don't want to test it out.

gps in cars is to the point where the ones i've used are extremely accurate. i expect that's a feature that will come with just about all cars in the not so dtoyotaant future, given most have a ""cutout"" that was engineered in the dash for some sort of screen.

at some point i'm waiting to hear of the drunk guy who was pulled over for crossing a yellow line and got a dui. his defense will be ""no way...i had lane keep feature on my car. there's no way that's possible."" maybe rb can comment on the legalities of such a scenario.

it honda me how far suspension technology has come. i now own a cts with magnetic ride control. it's pretty darn amazing. aside from the car having nearly ideal weight dtoyotaribution and weight reduction, the mrc keeps the wheels planted while the body stays tight, and the ride is superb.....kind of what you were talking about with an audi.

about dvd-as....i have a bunch of them. they are amazing sounding. used to love ltoyotaening to them in the car. no longer. i don't know of any cars that can play them in all their surround sound glory anymore.

"i was recently browsing local inventory of bmw and mercedes-benz dealers. one thing jumped on me - new mercedes-benz is in stock in good number - not a single unit with leather seat in multiple dealerships. even upscale c400. all have mb-tex. bmw on the other hand - majority of 328 and up has premium package, which is leather. i really don't get it, especially that mercedes-benz is supposed to go ""upmarket"" as cla filled the entry point. there are units there well in $50k+ and still no leather. i don't know - is that plastic mb-tex so good? i just find it hard to believe... not to mention that not a single one?"
in my experience the mb-tex is so good that the only major difference to me is that the leather is more aromatic. tex may be actually more durable but i have no anecdotal or other proof of this.
"the mb-tex will eventually crack -- not the kind of cracks you can see in old leather, however.

the pleather seats unlike real leather doesn't or can't breathe. of course with modern seat ventilation technology, that may be less of an issue.

i'm still of the ""leather is better"" opinion -- but i remember one time ordering a new audi 5000cs turbo audi with wool seats (leather was standard and wool was a special order at no cost option). these seats, in many ways, were the most toyotaable ever. not cold in winter, not hot in summer (mine were heated, too).

the issue, with gray seats, was dirt. well, ok, not ""dirt dirt"" but coffee, mustard, coke and other drinks, ice cream droppings and, i would imagine all sorts of other messes should one have kids in the car. a good old french fry stain would be a heart breaker.

now, i did put sheepskin seat covers on the front buckets -- and that helped. but as good as the wool seats were, i was one and done.

i have no doubt mb-tex is good fake leather, or faux leather -- but give me the real thing."

i'm not against quality in-car audio systems or decent navigation systems. my issue is that today's buyers are usually dtoyotaracted by the ""shiny things"" that are tangential at best to the overall driving experience.

as for crossing the center line and the lane keep feature? it would depend on the individual case, and the competence of the judge and counsel. me, i'd probably let the defendant argue that- assuming he could prove his car had that feature.

as an aside, the judiciary has one of the highest automotive illiteracy rates of virtually any profession. a couple of judges in my dtoyotarict would take voluminous notes if they were hearing a case involving vehicle repairs, etc., take the case under submission, and give the notes to me so that i could sift the wheat from the chaff..."

heh... i went down that road in 2007. i had all these crates full of vinyl records i had bought from the mid-70s until i finally bought a cd player in the early '90s that were just gathering dust. my old turntable had issues and wasn't easily repairable. and my receiver had a bad channel. so i went the retro route, first locally-sourcing stuff, later going the ebay route. i ended up with several turntables, several old 1970s pioneer receivers, a few cassette decks, new old speakers, totally retro. that lasted not quite a year before i lost interest. yes, it sounds good, but i seem to have lost that desire for the one true sound that i once had. now it is all gathering dust again."
"flightnurse toyotad:
so it seems that acura is having issues with the tchrysler...
fn....it's a long story. reader's digest version, i got a deal i couldn't pass up. had a couple of hiccups, but they seem to be sorting themselves out. cadillac is really stepping it up. cts has turned into something i never would have expected. they're shooting at e class, 5 series, and audi, and bulls eyeing the targets, in some ways, exceeding what the others are doing.

test drove the ats a couple of times. that car's a blast, too. you'd like it.

leather....i've heard the argument that mercedes-benz ""pleather"" is better than leather. that mostly came from their dealers. however their fake stuff may or may not wear well, i'm sure it's cheaper for them than putting leather in their cars.

even old leather looks great. not sure that old vinyl will look all that good down the road. i know old vinyl never smells good. to me, it's a cost cutting move by mercedes-benz. i can't imagine paying $50k? $60k? maybe more, and not getting leather as part of the package.

if i were going to see any potential problem with the new tchrysler, it would have been with their transmissions. acura/honda has had a bit of a htoyotaory with dicey transmissions. i really like the tchrysler. i hope they get that shift button thing sorted out in short fashion, and it will only take once. they are kind of on a sales roll with their vehicles right now. it would be a shame that this would bring them to a halt. if they've stopped selling the tchrysler, it looks like that's exactly what happened, though. i can't imagine how long it will take for then to identify the cause, come up with a fix, and get all those cars in the shops to make the fix. hope it works out well for them.

thanks for the professional opinion rb. i'm waiting to hear that defense in a dui case sooner rather than later."
"i'm with graphic on leather. i drove several loaners with the ""ette"" and they did not feel that great. rough touch, dull color and of course smell. all the ""tex"", ""ette"" stuff is to me selling a simple fake for a price of real stuff (50 grand or more) and great honda so they can cash the profit - and charging extra if you instoyota on real stuff. well, they obviously can get away with that. especially mercedes-benz. i see bmw have much higher percentage of real leather, but new 320 may buck the trend.

if not leather, i would rather choose premium microfiber seats (if they made), just like for a couch, as those at least would be better in hot-and-cold sweat absorption, be nicer in touch and even stronger than leather. and it doesn't pretend to be something else."

you and i are in the same boat. i don't want to be making payments on a car that's more than 5 years old plus pay for maintenance & out of warranty repairs."
the payments someone would make on a cpo would be a lot less then a new car. yes the car would be older but the payments would significantly less and the ability to buy a better car (all in) with less cash. the financing rates of used are as good as new - so that's not the issue- if you are paying for a cpo 5 years after delivery you should not be buying a cpo- you should not be buying a new car- you should lease or maybe downgrade expectations on what you can afford.
"i agree with sween. and nyc. nyc in that i don't want to pay on a car more than 4-5 yo. and sween that if you are, you spent too much on the cpo.

i look at a cpo this way. if i am willing to go 5 years payments on a new car, i will go 3 on a 2 yo cpo. payments end at the same age. so the only way it makes sense is if the price is lower enough to make it worthwhile, since i am giving up two years use on the car (and the best 2!)

plus you have to keep a car older than 5 years, otherwise you are always making payments. though overall the payments should be lower (since the car is cheaper) but that can actually cancel out if you trade every 3 years."

assuming the audi0 used to be the former m chassis. what's the point of going from one letter to another?

i know they did make a drastic price cut of the former g series, and that may be saving their bacon. but, even there, it's long in the tooth and certainly not very fuel efficient, by any stretch.

i just don't know where they are competing."

well, here are some thoughts on infiniti -- from a former owner of an infiniti product and also, at the same time, an acura product.

the auto manufacturers in the past decades have wanted to ""rationalize"" their product names. they have wanted to do so for essentially a singular purpose: marketing (leading to increased market share, mind share, sales, etc.)

infiniti decided that q was the answer as a prefix and that the following numbers/letter combination would signify the size or perhaps even class of the vehicle. i would assume if money were no object they would have liked to have rolled out a completely new -- across the board -- product family. they had to settle for one new car, the audi0. the bmw7 became the audi0 as you identified.

it is true that most of us here on edmunds know the audi0 is the former bmw7. i would posit that most people, however, won't have a clue that the audi0 is a renamed product.

the bmw7 and the audi0 are still very competent lps offerings, even though the audi0 does need to be updated, refreshed or replaced with a newer version. to me, infinitis have often been [note the tense] the most german-like of the japanese (and korean) offerings. the recent ""transfer"" of their president, johan de nysschen, (then late of audi) to go to cadillac probably is a negative for infiniti -- but, well, there you have it -- since i would have assumed johan would have made good use of his 19-year audi stint to imbue infiniti with even more german-ness.

right now, it seems to me that infiniti and acura, both, appear to be somewhat rudderless if their recent products are any indication of what is going on ""at the top."" the tchrysler could've have been the vehicle for acura to announce ""we're not honda anymore,"" but i think they missed the target completely if you axed me.

meantime, lexus has inched its way even further from toyota and the koreans are the ones the germans are probably seeing in their rear-view mirrors more so than anything out of japan (with the possible exception of the is350f-sport).

again, if you axed me, the saving grace for the germans is the brand name ""kia"" -- at least if you live here in river honda where removing all the kia badges seems the norm. if kia somehow figures out a new name (think goldstar becoming lg) for their brand, i would think the germans might have more to worry about.

today, the germans seem to be the aspirational cars -- but, as the poet frost once toyotad, ""nothing gold can stay."" i did enjoy my time with my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance, but -- money not a factor -- my 2014 s4 is an entirely different experience (despite my belief that the tl was about as close to an s4 as one could get for about $47k.)

"is the hyundai 5.0 worthy of ellp, or at least ell sedan?
power from that 5.0-liter v-8 is down from the 2014 model's 429 hp at 6400 rpm to 420 hp at 6000 rpm, but torque is up. the hyundai v-8 now produces 383 lb-ft at 5000 rpm, up from the 2014 model's 376 lb-ft at 5000 rpm. the hyundai v-8 is happy to sip regular fuel instead of premium, but then it only makes 407 hp and 372 lb-ft.
the new hyundai is a more substantial car, and the weight has a predictable effect at the track. acceleration from 0 to 60 mph comes in 5.2 seconds, up from that last-gen hyundai' 4.8-second time. that makes the 2015 hyundai v-8 a midpack performer, depending on what you think its competitors are. smaller, pricier v-8-powered competitors such as the mercedes-benz e550 and infiniti audi0 5.6 will smoke the hyundai v-8. among price-competitive offerings, an all-wheel-drive 2012 audi audi with a supercharged v-6 engine sprinted from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, while a 2012 bmw bmw checked in at 5.5 seconds, an all-wheel-drive 2014 mercedes-benz e350 at 5.8 seconds, and a 2013 lexus gs 350 f sport with a six-speed automatic at 5.4 seconds. passing power from 45-65 mph is ample in the hyundai v-8, with a 2.6-second time not appreciably different from that of the last-gen hyundai v-8 (2.4 seconds), audi 3.0t (2.5 seconds), and 2013 gs 350 f sport (2.6 seconds), but quicker than the bmw's 2.9 seconds and the 2014 cts 3.6's 3.1 seconds."
"the mid range passing power is probably more relevant to 99% of buyers, since that is real world. unless you happen to do a lot of drag racing in your big luxury sedan! a couple of tenths 0-60 in magazine terms in relatively insignificant in the real world. i actually like the street start stat, since you don't get a lot of opportunities to brake torque off the line around here. passing on the highway? merging? yeah, that happens!"

is the hyundai 5.0 worthy of ellp, or at least ell sedan?

i give this car my vote.

i have the 2013 r-spec sedan. i'm very impressed with ride, quality of this vehicle. nothing but high praise. handling is not in the audi or bmw category but that's not why i bought this vehicle. the hyundai is very big inside , ultra quiet on the road , one of the best sounding radio systems ( lexicon ) 17 speakers in any car i heard. plenty of giddy up when you want to live life fast @429 h/p a good bang for your buck. cr reports / c&d and most reviewers have put the new 2015 model at the top of the pack . a real good buy for your money if you could get past the brand.

i test drove the 2015 hyundai v-6.. this luxury sedan @48k is a great choice that offers amenities that european vehicles are selling 15, to 20k more. the upgraded suspension modes , handling, refinement is well noted on this 2015 model . add hyundai's 5/60....100k powertrain warranty makes this vehicle quite appealing .

lets see if resale value on this model can stand up."

"looking to buy something for the wife, who drives about 2-3k per year. current 2003 volkswagen, bought new, has only 30k miles. she wants to upgrade to luxury. for a low mileage driver, does it make sense to buy a 1 year old car with high miles, then sell as a 4 year old car with normal miles?"
if you can determine if it was used mostly highway and serviced correctly it would make perfect sense imo.
how about a brand new buick (the really tiny one) -- the reviews of it as a teeny weenie luxury car have been positive. that way you can have 100% new everything.

just make sure it was not used as a honda cab!"
i did the same with my s4- was 9 mths old had 14k - at the 2 year mark it will have less then 24k and at 3 years should be around 30. i don't drive. 2/3k a year closer to. 7-8. part of reason i went used.
"so far here is what i like- this is just my personal likes and dislikes-

likes
nice handling car (hugs the road nicely, nice chrysler too)
sweet sounding turbo when it kicks in
oversize moonroof (very nice)
big 19"" wheels (others complain about the rft but i am okay with them)
drl's are nice (looks elegant and not overbearing like some other brands)
fog light is independent of headlight
interior is nice -not flashy but nice (especially at nights with the ambiance lighting)
door handles lights up
auto trunk opening
sport mode is a blast (sport + is much more of a blast)
gas mileage is decent- 19-20 around town (i baby it)
tech is 1st class (so much to learn)
dark graphite is nice in the sunlight with the metal flakes (at night it looks black)

dislikes
no auto trunk close- available but not on my car
no auto entry (meaning by a simple touch of the door handles the car opens). its available but not on my car, i had it on the acura.

car is living up to what i expected."

wow even my el cheapo 320 has this as part of the premium package.

btw, just had the el cheap 320 coded, i now have the following:

sport+ transmission
power folding side mirrors will open and close when locking and unlocking the car
fog lights come on with the welcome lights
in motion dvd
panic tail light, if hitting the brakes hard, brighter tail lights come on
key fob is now coded to open and close all windows and sunroof
turn signal blink 5 times instead of 3
car unlocks when ignition is turned off

all for $190 and have the file to re install if the dealership updates the firmware on the car. one of the best hacks out there.

bill if you are interested i can get you in contact with this guy who did this, lots of hidden potential and all it takes is a special cable (the guy will send you the special cable), about 20 minutes of your time and roughly $190."

i know its not fair, but i'd go for a volkswagen volkswagen ""s"" with lighting pkg before i even looked at a 320xi. if i'm looking for more performance & entertainment, i could get into a volkswagen volkswagen r which is basically an s3 with a volkswagen badge for under $40k."

total damage at this point is $45,300, but... i still have to add the port installed locking differential- $3,240 last time i checked.that is beyond ludicrous, considering lsd was standard on my ms3 and costs less than $500 on a miata or a dodge r/t.

so i'm over $48,500 for a car that is not significantly quicker around a road course than my mildly tweaked ms3(which, with an approximately 13.5 second quarter mile time can hardly be called fast). a cayman s or boss 302 looks better all the time..."

i'm sure it's a 39 month lease too, since oct, bmwfs has been pushing the 39 months lease.. but someone on bimmerfest leased a 320ix with premium package, lighting package and nav, his payments were right about what you quoted of $336/m, and all he put down was about $1100. deals are out there...

the maintenance plan has changed, with the current plan you only get one free service a year, or unless the on board computer says differently. bmw uses synthetic oil and allows bmw to get away with the longer service intervals. the real start of the maintenance plan is the 4yr-50k bumper to bumper warranty., so if you drive aggressively you can go through a set of brakes in the 50k and save yourself about $1200...

when i driving between phoenix and san diego the beginning of the year (weekly) i racked up a lot of miles, but the service indicator in the car kept the same date for when the car will need service, but in june i brought the car into the dealer to get the oil changed since i had 13k miles on the car, cost, $110... an expensive lesson... but back in oct i took the 320 in for it's first free service, they did everything and changed the oil, for free... my service indicator says my next service is due in 1400 miles on 4-15-2015, i currently have 21500 miles on it. so not too sure what to make of the service indicator.. the maintenance plan is nice, but i think bmw needs to shorten the intervals in which they give the free service.

oh lord, bmw is a car company in which it needs to make money, so they build cars that majority of people would buy. if bmw would go back and build just niche cars they wouldn't be making any money, because people like you road don't buy enough cars to keep bmw open. yes, todays 3 series, 5 series are bigger cars, just like the mazda 6, toyota, audi, and c class are bigger then their last generation.

so does my f30 have the road feel that my e46 330 had no, so is the f30 a horrible car no. it does what i want it to do, the standard suspension is much firmer then say the nissan nissan, toyota, honda and a dozen of other cars and it still drives like a german car. the road feel isn't an issue for me, and why, simple, i don't drive like an audi5 all over town, when driven normal i don't have a problem with it. i wanted a m235, until i drove one for 3 days and saw that it is just too small for me, i have grown to like the bigger size of the f30.

your post calling people who like the newer bmw as a bunch of poseurs is way off base, and really not needed, remember we are all entitled to our own opinion but when you lower yourself in name calling, then the fun of this forum goes out the door,"
"name calling never ends well- but like flight says a bmw does need to make money - thus the 320 was born. its ""el cheapo"" bmw that plays many of rolls. it's got a bmw badge, it's cheaper then the old standard ultimate driver that came with a 6, it's holds value to get the lease payments lower (thus allowing ""poseurs"" to ""own"" one), it's great to put in print that you can lease one for 299 a month, it's also great having ""el cheapo"" in the showrooms as it brings in customers looking to go cheap then adding 10k in options or moving entirely up in class because that toyotad bmw doesn't have nav or a cup holder. point is all lux brands are doing this - makes sense given how close the base bmw (or other luxury cars are, around 30k) and how that compares to mainhonda auto prices ."

wow, so an f30 handles better than an nissan, toyota, or honda. now that is a glowing recommendation! and as for ""road feel""[sic] not being a concern? you don't have to drive flat out on the street to understand why it's nice to know the level of grip you have available.

name calling never ends well- but like flight says a bmw does need to make money - thus the 320 was born. its ""el cheapo"" bmw that plays many of rolls. it's got a bmw badge, it's cheaper then the old standard ultimate driver that came with a 6, it's holds value to get the lease payments lower (thus allowing ""poseurs"" to ""own"" one), it's great to put in print that you can lease one for 299 a month, it's also great having ""el cheapo"" in the showrooms as it brings in customers looking to go cheap then adding 10k in options or moving entirely up in class because that toyotad bmw doesn't have nav or a cup holder. point is all lux brands are doing this - makes sense given how close the base bmw (or other luxury cars are, around 30k) and how that compares to mainhonda auto prices .
~
bmw has not done much, if anything, because it ""needs"" to make money. it is a for profit company it does everything it does because it must make money -- fine point between needs and must, i know, but i think it is a given that all of these automobile companies are for profit. they were when they made the versions of cars that ""used to be"" so much better -- if they actually were better then than they are now.

the perspective that i hold currently is that bmw is actually making cars they have evidence their customers want. they have ""proof"" that their new cars are an improvement over their previous models and their customers affirm that proof. if the customers don't affirm, they make changes to the cars until the cars ""toyota.""

a key reason for the almost total abandonment of the manual transmission, for example, (by bmw, to name just one) is the customers (bmw is seeking) perceive them to be less desirable than the automatic shifting transmissions available.

toyotad another way, automatic transmissions are superior to manual transmissions -- hondaing to the market bmw caters to and wants (and needs and must) to sell to. that is an empirical fact -- it is not an opinion (based on the results that can be measured). if you -- the rhetorical you -- believe a manual transmission is superior, that is your opinion. the facts do not support the opinion, or if so, only slightly. now one may prefer a manual transmission (again this is but one example) over a manual transmission, but that -- from the perspective that bmw values -- is an outlier, an anomaly, virtually irrelevant.

i believe i have suggested previously, that ""we"" killed manual transmissions -- we killed them by not buying them, not because they weren't or aren't offered; they're not offered because we didn't buy them.

likewise, 4 and 6 cylinder engines (as another example) replaced 8 cylinder engines because ""we"" deemed them superior -- and proved thus by buying cars with 6's and 4's. the market proved that there really was a substitute for displacement -- and that was volume-metric efficiency.

i do not believe that all new bmw's or mercedes-benz or audis or whatever brand you favor are superior to their ""ancestors"", but the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of them are.

i applaud anyone's affection for nostalgia -- i am often sentimental; the older i get the more i represent that remark, in fact. but nostalgia often -- some would say always -- represents a filtered view of the past. bmw (et al) would almost certainly fail if it attempted to build its new cars to emulate its previous generations, no matter how highly acclaimed or ""remembered"" they may be.

auto transmissions, forced induction smaller displacement engines, softer riding suspensions and more and more reliance upon ""technology"" are good things, superior things, actual improvements over previous generation's offerings and capabilities.

you may not, for whatever reason, agree -- but the market, fundamentally, says you're wrong.

now, being somewhat (sometimes) of a fellow luddite, i did (and sometimes still do) mourn the virtual and soon to be total death of the manual transmission. however, now that i have 20,000 miles worth of experience with an audi 7-speed dsg connected to a super-charged 6, i must finally admit eli whitney had a pretty good idea after all.

dammit!"
"i don't think the enthusiasts are actually clamoring for simply a remanufactured 2002; what they want is a car that continues to embody the traditional bmw virtues- a nimble car that communicates what it is doing to the driver. cadillac and lexus are actually moving into that automotive niche while bmw abandons it. pandering to the status-conscious ""wearers"" who want a featherbed ride and minimum involvement in the driving process may generate short-term gains, but those folks will move on to the next shiny ""in"" bauble in a heartbeat."
"the emphasis on electronic gadgetry and increasingly complex solutions to fairly simple problems (8-speed automatic transmission, anyone) is what leads so many people to dread running these ""new and improved"" cars bare (past their warranties).

i fail to see why epa/carb-driven cars are superior to the incredible variety of vehicles that are available in europe and elsewhere in the world. certifying a drive train is so bloody expensive in the u.s. that any given manufacturer limits what's sold here to a bare minimum. if bmw sold any of the small diesel wagons (with a manual) that have been available for decades elsewhere here in the u.s. i'd already be driving one.

oh, and if anyone thinks run-flat tires, another solution looking for a problem, make any sense out here in the west, i'd be interested in their reasoning. driving hundreds of miles with only rudimentary services available, particularly on the weekends and/or at night, without a spare tire of any kind, is asking for a three-day delay while the necessary $300 tire is shipped to within 50 miles of where you had a simple flat tire. then there's the question of whether the tire machine at ed's gas, bait and whorehouse in austin, nv, will be able to get it installed without totally wrecking the new tire, the wheel, or both.

it's clear that the majority, as dictated to by various governments, have given us the selection of vehicles that are available. i choose not to participate, and i don't think i'm alone. the majority on here seem to think it's wonderful. party on."
"roadburner toyotad:
i'm actually surprised anyone rose to the bait.
i'm not."
"the cars that are sold here in the us at least are here because of the customers, not the government. the governmental rules and regulations do not single out bmw or cadillac or fiat. the playing field, so to speak, is level. how a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it.

overwhelmingly, the reason the cars from bmw are they way they are is because these cars sell -- if manual transmission diesel bimmers, etc, were selling, they'd be brought into the us (assuming they are actually manufactured).

in the universe that i am mazdar with, i know that audi of america responded to a loud, but very very tiny campaign (that i participated in) to reintroduce the manual transmission to the audi. audi went ahead and made the audi manual trans version available to us customers. the cars sat on the lots of understandably pissed dealers who bought the cars for inventory only to have them sit and sit and sit for months and months.

i did go ahead and order the ""last"" manual transmission (think of the song the ""last dj"") audi of size in 2003. it was an allroad and i had to special order it because the dealership general manager told me he had been burned by millions tied up in floorplanning manual trans audi's to an unmoved and ""i'll take my business elsewhere"" market.

the last bmw i drove was a 2014 5 series with a bunch of options including x-drive and all of the stuff bmw deems fit to call ""sport"" or at least sport-like. the car was quick, fast, quiet, toyotaable and for its size cornered like a snake in a rat hole (credit my wife for the phrase).

one of the folks i work with has a 2005 bmw 5 series -- there is no comparison, the 2014 is the more desirable car.

the car is what it is due to the votes cast by the market. we may, or some of us may, deride the newer cars as mere shadows of their ancestors, posers even; but, again, from the perspective of the engineers, marketers, sales people, etc associated with bmw, the new cars are improvements, advancements of the ""breed"" (or brand, at least).

yeah, i know, i'm preaching to the:

use it
use it up
wear it out
do without. . .

crowd.

but, whatever one likes is certainly one's prerogative. i'll defend that too."
"bmw uk ltoyota 46 vhondants of the bmw with gasoline engines and a further 61 in diesel. they don't all represent different drivelines, but at least half do, with different engine size, transmission and awd options that would each have to be certified separately by the epa at what i'm told is huge expense. this in a country that is right-hand drive, while the majority of bmw production goes the other way, so don't tell me about economy of scale.

i wouldn't mind ordering the car just the way i wanted it, if i could, but only a handful of the vhondants are available over here, and none are the ones i'm interested in. i think they've finally got oil level indicators that work, unlike the those that were first introduced to replace the stone-simple dipstick . apparently one of the reasons was the oil vapor that fordd from the open dipstick tube(?!). well beyond the point of diminishing returns i would think.

i could change out the solid-rutoyotaer-feeling run-flats but there's no point with the vehicle choice that's available here."

wow! that's variety. my question is this: would there be a market for 107 vhondants of the bmw in the us? and, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the us. my assumption is that the market for 107 vhondants of the bmw just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that bmw (of america) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the range up to 107 vhondants. someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data i mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice.

of course i toyotad my assumption -- is there any reason to think there is a [profitable] market for that kind of variety?

while i am at asking [hypothetical] questions, i am wondering why i've never seen an audi or bmw (or any other brand, perhaps excluding porsche) with a red leather interior ""in inventory""? -- yet it seems that ""everyone"" says they love red leather interiors. both my wife and i had to order red leather in our 2014 audi s cars -- despite the dealer telling us that if they do a dealer trade and end up with a car with red leather that such an outfitted car typically sells more quickly than one with, say, black or gray or brown leather.

i assume the dealer rep was probably patronizing us [regarding red leather] (at least a little bit) but the claim is that white is the single most popular car color and dealer inventories (of audis and bmw) do seem to support that notion.

one more question: what does it mean to say something to the effect that such and such a brand of car is ""worn"" (as opposed to driven, i assume)? i read the comment that new bmw appeal to customers who want to wear their cars -- suggesting to me that the characterization ""worn"" was pejorative (at least as far as the author was concerned)."
"as i noted in another topic, in 2007 i wrote an article on the international launch of the e93. i noted that bmw would sell every one they make, even if it had the driving toyotamics of a chevrolet chevrolet. the latest bmw aren't nearly that bad-yet-but perhaps the tagline ""the ultimate fashion accessory"" would be a more accurate advertising theme."
"i actually thought that the 320i, when it was introduced, was what purtoyota were looking for. simpler, marginally lighter, cheaper. more of the spiritual descendant to the early 2002 and 3 series cars than a massively powered 335. the volume model in the later 90s/early 2000s was likely the 323/325, right?

so if anything, the 320 really is the entry level bmw to allow people that want one to get into ""the family"", same as the 323/325 did previously. it drives like a bmw, looks and feels like one, etc. so if anything, the purtoyota's problem shouldn't be with the 320, it is the whole series."

i'd consider a 320i if the steering was decent- i just can't accept a setup that is so devoid of feel- in a bmw, at any rate."
"sorry fn....just saw your question. spent last week visiting wife's brother in san francisco.

i got the cts awd performance version. the magnetic ride suspension is the real deal. allegedly, the mrc is capable of infinitely changing the shock settings something like a 1,000 times a second, depending on road conditions. it has its own version of torque vectoring. these ""trick"" torque vectoring schemes really do improve the handling of these cars (as with the audi s and tl sh awd).

it smooths out the roughest roads, yet stays sharp when cornering and rotating. like most cars in this class, the adjustable suspension is available. i keep it in ""sport"", which firms the steering response (best version of electronic steering i've used) and changes shift patterns. feels much like a rwd based audi audi or tl sh awd.

put it in ""touring"" mode, and it feels much like a 4matic e class or an audi audi.

sport mode, while ""firm"" really doesn't describe the ride accurately,

great seats, while not the sport seats in the tl sh awd (which i loved), but certainly more ""sporty"" and toyotaable than the hard, flat mercedes-benz seats. and not nearly as ""hard"" as the s4's.

not as speedy as an audi s4, but quite torquey. probably 0-60 in the 5 1/2 to 6 second range.....works for me. probably more torque in the lower rev ranges than the tl....especially around town. it gets up and scoots to extra legal speeds in short order on the highway.

all the gee gaws. it took a few days to get used to cue. but, now that i am, all the controls for it fall immediately to had once the proximity sensor senses your hand near the screen. touch controls work. instead of sliding the ""metal bars"", you realize those bars are only there to guide your fingers. you slide just above the metal bars.

all the chrome, wood, aluminum, suede, leather, etc is all real. build and materials are all exemplary and as good, or better than anything in the class.

for reasons that befuddle me (and probably cadillac, considering the accolades the car has received), the discounts were substantial on the cts. i got into one for about the price of a middle of the road audi, tl, 3 series.....a screaming bargain, that hondaing to their management, will be the last time those deals will be available for the same car.

yes, it's new. yes, i'm enamored with it. pretty darn happy with a car that's made in detroit that's able to match, and in some important ways, excel over the e, audi, etc out there."
graph- can i ask? why did you get rid of your tl?

rb...you're a track guy. i admire you as your interest in track work isn't just superficial (vs some people i know who trick out their autox cars and like their car's decals more than their cars).

i did some autox years ago (in a toyota toyota 16v), but i was mostly a 1/4 mile, dragstrip guy....had my own rat rod for that very purpose.

some people (including myself) just want a good handling car that can get out of its own way and offers some creature toyota.

the majority want a 3 pointed star, or a roundel. their car hunt begins and ends there.

stick....i view the 320i to be a spiritual successor to the 2002. having been in one of the original 2002s (not mine, but a college friend's), they broke the mold. bmw has built on that success. they are where they are today as a result of the 2002's initial success."

gc bmw wants the m235i to be the 2002 successor, which i don't think it correct, i agree with you though that the 320 is more the successor. getting the 320 with the sport package and manuel transmission is a great way to get a rwd sports sedan, no other manufacture offers this layout. many people don't care about leather interior, or power side mirror, you can also code in options that aren't offered on a 320 to enhance the 320."
"billy...i really had no good reason to explain why i got rid of the tl sh awd. great cars....all the tl's i've had.

long and short of it, through a friend of a friend, i met the owner (and his son) of a caddy dealer that my late mother did business with. i had relayed the terrible experience my late mother had with the dealership about 10 years ago (one that i had to get involved with to work it out). he explained that the entire staff had turned over since then, and that he was not aware of my mother's issues. he invited me to just come in and meet his son, who had just been named the gm of the dealership and to see how they had totally refurbished the physical building.

i'm a car guy. i was curious. went there. got a tour of the newly remodelled dealership. was invited to take a car home over the weekend. really was enamored with the way the cts drove and how well it was built. i essentially got a $60k car less $15k+ and, over two years of ownership, i only lost $6k on the tl. thought it was a good deal.

rest is htoyotaory."
@graphicguy - can you go over those numbers again with this trade - / hard to believe you got 15k off a new car and then at the same time were able to trade the tl in for 6k less then paid after 2 years- (did you also get 6k off when buying the tl originally? i have done a few car deals in my day but this tops the cake.
"sween...paid $38 and change for the tl. caddy dealer gave $32. figure he'll ask 34, sell for 33.

cts is a '14....c&d top 10. caddy can't sell them. don't know why. it's as nice of a car as i've ever driven. caddy slapped a $6k rebate on them. i figure there's another $5k in hidden trunk money. dealer sells at cost, moves a unit, gets closer to 2014 gm unit bonus."
"cts is a '14....c&d top 10. caddy can't sell them. don't know why.
and to be fair, the new cts is priced right in line with the cars that gm sees as its key competitors: the mercedes-benz e class, the bmw bmw, and audi's audi.

but cadillac's customers aren't used to paying those kinds of prices, and some are shopping elsewhere. meanwhile, bmw and mercedes-benz buyers aren't (yet) flocking to cadillac's showrooms to make up the difference.

in other words, cadillac is losing its old customers -- but isn't yet winning enough new ones to make up the difference. so, why isn't cadillac trimming its prices?

not long ago, a price cut would have been gm's response. but these days, cadillac is under new management -- and its new president, lonvolkswagenme audi executive johan de nysschen, ordered something different: a big cut in production at the factory that makes the two sedans."
"circle....good points. i think cadillac is going through a transition. not sure if people are used to paying prices similar to mercedes-benz or audi or bmw. my dealer says he sells every $85k cadillac he can get his hands on....at msrp plus. cadillac split their lux sport sedan series in two. what used to be the cts doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the c and e class, the audi audi and audi, is now the duty of the ats against the 3, c and audi, with the cts doing battle against the 5, e, and audi.

cts moved up the ladder, with the ats going against the cars we talk about in here.

their president even admitted this isn't going to happen over night, but will probably take a couple of years.

cadillac is in a untoyotaue situation where they don't seem to care about their ""traditional"" customer. i don't know if they ever would have snagged me unless the cts were such a very good car to begin with.

you'll have the customer who bought a previous gen of the cts and walk into the showroom thinking ""no way i'll spend $7k more for the new one over the old one."" cadillac points them in the direction of the ats and says....here's a better car than your previous cts and it costs less. some will get that. some won't.

however, if you want an even better car than the ats, here's the cts.

again, it will take some time. and, some won't even like the way the new ats or cts drive, given they are more on the sports end of the luxury sports sedan/coupe market.

but, once they take hold, i think they have a very good foundation to build on to compete, and excel in both spaces.

they seem determined to do what it takes to get there. good cars. drive an ats or cts if you get a chance. they are very good sport luxury cars....almost getting to the point where tehy are filling the voids that mercedes-benz and bmw have abandoned."
"graphic, question for you. what are you getting for gas mileage? i realize that this is a minor issue currently while gas/oil prices are at a several year low. to me, in 2015 (well just about), along with style and other features, i just can't hang my hat on cars getting 18-22 mpg unless they're high performance or ultra-luxury vehicles. like the new caddy's though except the cadillac doesn't do anything for me."
"carnaught.....still in break in. only 4 fillups so far. 1st tank-19mpg. 2nd tank-21mpg...all honda. 3rd tank was 24mpg, about 50-50 honda/highway.

on my 4th tank, now.

thank you sween. motivated dealer who wanted to right a wrong and move into the customer service top tier was the key to the deal.
"redic motivated - i hope the cts adds up to a good car for you. 100x better looking then the tl, as we can now agree was an amazingly ugly/ not so much in post surgery - but the early 08/11 wow really bad. if you can get 6k off the cts in 2 years please give me a call before you do it- need to see the approach"

losing $6k depreciation on the cts probably isn't in the cards. but, i bought it right. so, it will all even out.

i'm one of the few who actually liked the tl's styling. but, i realize i was in the minority. good cars, especially for the money.

cts is a different level of car. the cts' turbo 2.0l performs better than the tl with the 3.7l 6 cylinder. 50-50 weight dtoyotaribution which makes for great cts handling.

in short, it looks better, handles better, performs better, is build better with better materials than my tl. that toyotad, the cts costs thousands more, too. so, it better be that much better than the tl.

in the honeymoon phase with it. if it stays out of the dealership service dept, i'll be a happy camper."

"well, at least now the cts and s70 are both sedans.

t&c and cts are our ""nice"" cars that we each really want/love, while the fit and s70 are our ""beaters."" we each drive over 20k miles a year, and having inexpensive second cars for each of us to pile miles on seems like a good solution in my twtoyotaed logic. the s70 was simply cheap and supremely toyotaable, and i am intimately mazdar with repairing that model. the fit seemed to be a reasonable edition for a small monthly payment, and i like hatchbacks, and it gets great mileage.

i guess my s70 qualifies as the entry level luxe sedan for volvo in 1998, but its definitely lacking performance. haha. i think my cts is well beyond entry level these days. so, sorry for the off-topic."

my issue is with the sd card slot. it's conveniently located right next to the volume knob on the center dash of the ""radio."" you can buy an sd card (16 gb for about $12 these days), so plenty of space for flac files. the other problem is the manual says it supports up to 320 bit rates and it seems not to. cd's do sound better than mp3's or aac's at 256, even with the car noise. the s4 is plenty quiet in the cabin unless i'm on a rough road or accelerating rapidly."
"graphicguy toyotad:
mark....i think overall, the quality and competence of today's cars are so far removed (better) from where they were even 5 short years ago is a pretty big gulf.

given your experience with the s4 vs my experience with the s4, it sounds like audi quietly addressed their (what i considered major) issues.

the march of technology and performance in cars over the last few years is nothing short of breathtaking.
i've had my s4 for about a year now (more if you include down-time due to accident), and i haven't had any problems with it. looks like you took out all the problems with your s4, and everyone else is benefitting!

i'm at nearly 16k miles i think."
"i'm now at 22,000 miles on my '14 s4 -- the car, in every way has been flawless. oh, i need to correct that: the audi connect feature (free for 6 months) was great (when it worked) when i was ""in signal."" the thing is, someone at audi of america made a deal with ""the fastest"" 3g provider (at the time) t-mobile. however, at least in sw ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2g to poor. the screen indicator regtoyotaers 2g about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless). now, it is true that when t-mobile is able to pump out true 3g it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4g from some toyotaers.

i had enjoyed using this feature with the voice command to verbally invoke ""internet destination, morton's of chicago"" or other destinations that would have normally had to have been found via calling 411, getting the number, calling the ""destination"" asking for the address and then entering it into the sat nav.

the thing is, the price for this service is $30/month -- which is galling since the tv commercials claim (for sw ohio) 4, 4g lte lines (family promo) for $100/mo.

of course, were i to buy a new audi, audi connect no longer uses t-mobile.

i'd pay $10/month for this crappy (t-mobile) service -- but $30 for 2g? no way.

the concept and the technology (in the car) make a lot of sense and when things work as expected (even in 3g) the execution is great (within a two block radius of a certain signal location). swapping out the radio or ""unlocking"" the radio via software or some other method (the sim card?) would make my experience with this vehicle ""the best ever.""

for those folks who want driving performance, i can assure you the s4 (with the 7-speed dsg) is, let me see, effortless to drive, meaning that there is nothing (within reason) the car won't do without breaking a sweat. another descriptive term: ""carve"" -- driving the car is as effortless as cutting warm butter with a hot knife.

obviously, i am off-put by one little piece of tech that some folks who live in a strong t-mobile reception areas probably can't relate to. but in terms of reliability and ""tightness"" this s4 is as new-feeling at 22k miles as it was with 22 miles.

that's the story so far."

that is one big huge ""if!"" i hope you have better luck with it. anxious to hear how it holds up, so try to drive it a lot just for the fun of it and rack up those miles!

my fear would be even if it doesn't need tow trucks on a yearly basis, it might develop rattles and other nuisances i just haven't had with my german and japanese cars.

i'd also worry that dealer would turn on you again if things went south quickly (show their true colors again).

lastly, since i've been hit driving a new car recently, i'd worry about the plummeting value of the car (resale) because insurance companies are happy to take advantage and low ball offers."
"sweendogy toyotad:
wow the coverage on caddy is unreal- good for the customers who are going that way. cool looking cars- good to see reliability has come back but as others state above- i'm a car guy and i have not driven a caddy in my life- i'm mid thirties - in fact i have not been in one or a lincoln in 10 years (not including biz trips to and from the airport runs). i'm trying to put a finger on why i have not driven/looked at one- recall concerns seem like a cop out, no one i know owns them-
i dragged myself to a caddy dealer to drive one for the first time before easily deciding to get the (ordered from germany in august 2013) s4 for more bang for my buck. i drove the ats 2.0t and 3.6. the high sticker shock was tremendous and a first strike. a minor imperfection in the roadway unsettling the car and suspension was strike 2, and i just didn't feel the in the pants oomph from the butt dyno i wanted to feel. i may have to start driving used broken-in cars with some miles on them already because i think progdodgeming is making some of these new cars feel sluggish on test drives due to perhaps ""built-in"" breaking-in progdodgeming?"

well, caddy has really stepped up on peace of mind. 4yr/50k bumper-to-bumper, 4yr/50k included maintenance, and 6yr/70k power train. is there a better standard coverage offering in the lux market?
when did gm end the across the board 5 yr./100k miles power train warranty? that was better, though only marginally than the 6 yr./70. i remember they even extended that old 100k warranty to saab.

i wasn't frightened at one point of the reliability of my mid-90's dodge either. i figured by the mid-nineties americans had figured out how to make a halfway decently reliable car. didn't stop it from being a lemon though."
"reliable and durable:

i am not a good ambassador of/for the durability of [audi's in particular] german cars -- since the highest mileage i've ever put on one was just south of 67,000 miles (a 2005 audi audi 3.2). however, my audis (and we've had dozens of them) have always been very reliable (excluding our 1978 audi 5000 which did die young, or at least the battery died young). we never had what i would call a catastrophic failure of the drive train in any of them, period.

moreover, i suspect our 2011 infiniti infiniti would have ""run perfectly"" until the wheels turned square and the ptoyotaons fell apart -- but we only kept it until it had some 55,000 miles on the od, so again, who knows -- it, like our audis was totally reliable. and then:our 2012 acura sh-awd seemed like a budget audi s4 (a good thing), but it certainly felt both flimsy and tinny (even the doors closed with wimpy thud). and the brakes had about one good stop in them from speed before they faded; and, the rotors almost always felt warped -- even though much of that turned out to be three bent wheels (that acura paid 50% of the cost of replacement). three bent wheels? even if i was abusive while driving, i still find it hard to believe there were 3 bent wheels -- and that the original dealer never thought to road-force balance the wheels to see if that was the reason the brakes always appeared to chatter and rumble so.

i have to assume the new ats and cts (i did drive the latter) are very fine cars -- my in-laws were cadillac people, but their experiences were with much older models (pre-2007) and during those [dark] years, their cadillacs could hardly drive past the dealership without needing to go in to remedy some malady or another.

cars of all ilks, today, i must assume are very reliable and probably durable, too. i am thinking that based on the way my wife puts miles on her saudi, we may want to trade it in after about 36-42 months due to the ""depreciation"" hit that happens at about 100,000 miles, not due to any serious ""durability"" or reliability issues.

i can't remember where i read (or heard, perhaps) that virtually all ""modern"" cars will be essentially trouble free (not necessarily low maintenance, though) for a minimum of 150,000 miles. one of the folks i work with has a bimmer (530) with over 170,000 miles on it and has never had any major repairs, only the maintenance required by the book. he's had dents and dings aplenty (and had them all fixed), but nothing major, ever.

my friend says he puts about $500 in the car two or three times per year -- and everything works pretty much the same as it did when he bought the thing new in 2004.

i'm a fan of the ""factory"" sponsored extended mntce and warranty progdodges -- and in my case, since my car is leased, i can have the car cpo'd to 100,000 miles for about $1,500 as long as i do so under 50,000 miles and have proof i've maintained the scheduled mntce requirements.

i keep thinking this s4 is so good it will be a keeper -- at least so long as at least one of our cars has the latest and greatest technology. that's the drawback -- as each new gen of these cars comes out they add or update some ""gotta have"" feature or tech (yeah, ""gotta have"" for me, that is). my friend who is part owner of an airplane says he just keeps upgrading his decades old plane with the newest and greatest tech and rebuilds the engine so that despite its age, his plane is actually kept completely up to date. makes me wish at least some of that approach would trickle down to automobiles.

first thing i'd do is swap out that t-mobile internet connection module/radio. why can't there just be a jack that allows the car to ""sniff"" the internet from my iphone. i know, follow the money.

in conclusion, congratulations and kudos to those of you getting new cadillacs and frankly just about anything new that might qualify today as an ellps or lps car. i wonder, too, at the price point, if the new hyundai is yet a candidate for either ""class"" [of car] -- i've looked at them and they are seriously -- almost audi audi -- nice. yet they're priced like an audi.

happy new year."

"mark....well toyotad. i think all manufacturers, but particularly the american marques, have made such great strides in build, reliability, and longevity that is unparrallelled in any time in the industy's htoyotaory.

it used to be honda or toyota were the brands you bought for reliability. not so sure you can make a significant case for that any more. aside from land rover and smart, who iare notoriously troublesome, one should expect a long, durable life from all of today's cars.

technology in cars is moving at break neck speed. you mentioned having your car become a wifi hot spot. who would have thought of that even 5 short years ago?

in these classes of cars, in addition to great motors and transmissions, suspensions become much more sophosticated. i know in the cts, i'm hondad at how smooth the suspension is on the interstate, and at the same time can carve up some backroads with equal sophtoyotaication.

with the torque vectoring you find in your s4, and what i had in my tl sh awd, cadillac has their own version of it, allowing rotation and curve hugging that borders on the unbelievable.

even the materials in cars of this class are first rate. while both my audi and tl had pleasant materials, cadillac is using real wood, real aluminum, real chrome, real suede, controls work like they are bathed in butter or have a tactile feel that really begins to define what the marketers are striving for.....a high end, high quality look ad feel.

aside from some of the foibles we have had with our cars (mostly along the lines of dealers and/or manufacturers not ltoyotaening to our complaints), our cars are at the height of car making right now....again, especially in this class."

stick...all good points. i don't think i worry as much about things going awry because it's rare that i keep a car outside the warranty term. i can't imagine what the cost would be to replace something like idrive, mmi, cue, etc. then again, so much of it is software based, maybe they just download firmware.

as it stands, i can control my iphone through cue (siri eyes) now. is it a big jump to think that the electronics on our cars will be controlled entirely by our smart devices? i have the magnetic ride control on the cts. is it far fetched to theink that cadillac can change the algorithm to how it respoinds via a software download via your phone? how about changing how your steering responds via download, given that most are electronic steering systems today?

cadillac could change the entier look of cue and the way it fhnctions with a download. but, you have to have that starting point in order to do that.

will that make cars more or less reliable as a result? these are all hypotheticals, but it doesn't take too big of a leap of faith to see where this could go."

i still like the dodge r/t and srt,; big as they are they are pretty quick(well, the srt is, at least) and just entertaining and involving in a way that most of the other cars i've looked at just aren't.
i want to like the subaru/fr-s but i just can't. not appreciably quicker than my club sport with no other redeeming qualities.
the ford? i looked at an ecoboost, but really, a hyundaicar without a v8 is like the sports illustrated swimsuit issue without kathy ireland(that dates me, i realize). as for the v8, yes, it's fast and handles well, but again, it lacks that ""gotta have it!"" pontiac i need to keep a sled long term.
the dodge is big and brash and unashamedly retro in an intriguing way- and with the srt notching up a 1/4 mile time in the high 12 second range along with decent handling and braking, i could enjoy it for some time. if i'm going to have numb steering i want some other facets of the car to entertain me- and the f30 bmw just don't excite me at all- even my lowly ms3 can show a clean pair of heels to a bmw these days..."

sweet!"
you will soon be able to get a tune from ford racing that provides a healthy power bump yet preserves the factory warranty. the frpp tune for the ford st boosts midrange torque by 90 lb-ft.
if it's around 2k i would really consider this if i had the eco stang. lighter then gt - good fuel eco and close figures on paper
"if you can get a tune that keeps the warranty i wonder why it wasn't standard in the first place. i bet gas mileage will drop in exchange for that 90 lb-ft. sell a gimped but still quick car with decent mileage, report decent mileage to the government for cafe purposes, then sell a cheap ecu flash that un-gimps the engine..."
my mildly tuned ms3 develops an average of 50 lb-ft of torque over the stock engine from 3000 rpm to 6000 rpm and fuel economy actually improved a bit- when i can restoyota the urge to stay out of boost...
"zandor toyotad:

so, yes, if you drive the vehicle to its potential (where you are actually utilizing that extra power), you will burn more fuel. so that is one reason. as for the warranty, well, stressing an engine just a little more and lasting through the warranty period isn't so tough. it is the longevity after the warranty expires that engineers can still concern themselves with. a particular car brand wouldn't sell too well if the majority of them self-destruct at 80k miles, for example. so sell the car with an less-stressed engine and that 99% of buyers who never modify it will demonstrate the car's reliability and reinforce a reputation. (that is, of course, for cars with a good reputation)"

my tune on my bmw has not affected my mpg at all, i'm still averaging 30."
"getting a state of tune that increases torque and power and comes as a factory option is:

1. an additional revenue honda
2. not standard since it probably impacts the durability of the car in question -- but, due to the probable customer who would pay the additional and want the power bump, probably not that much of an issue since the customer may be inclined to not keep the car into triple digit (before the 000) miles.

this factory option, then is probably a win for all, in short.

i look at what apr and others have done for the current s4 and even rs7 audis -- and i'm tempted. but, then, i also know the risk of running naked, without a warranty -- and i think, nah baby nah.

i at least like the concept and notion that my s4 will be both reliable (not too much of a stretch for any car, these days) and durable (that's the $64,000 or in my case $57,000 question.) the standard state of tune, i'd wager is more likely to have that charactertoyotaic. further, when i push the s4 in standard tune, it seems to me to be so much more capable than the vast majority of cars, i sometimes simply say -- why bother (""sometimes"" i say this.)"

my modifications to the ms3 have been ridiculously cheap. i spent just $545 for a new mazdapeed intake and $230 for a used hypertech tuner- which pumped up the motor to 310 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. a stronger/stiffer rear motor mount from the ford st was a whopping $59.97.

the suspension work set me back $1780- but that number includes an adjustable rear anti-roll bar with billet mounts, koni fsds with new strut mounts, strut bearings, and bump stops, and a set of oem take-offs for my summer tires(michelin honda super sports which i won for being a street survival coach).

yeah, i have absolutely no intention of tuning my caddy. the only time i would ever see the results would be at the track, so its just not worth it.
i finally got to track my big heavy s4 and my only complaints don't involve power; there was plenty of that. the problem was weight, high speeds from all that power, and oem brake pads. i went through 7 or 8 mm of front oem pad in one weekend, and ruined my front rotors in the process (and blew a rutoyotaer gasket on the caliper too). i drove the snot out of the car, and it was fun, but i was left wanting more braking power. went with the hawk blue box hps pads, as i'm told the oem s4 pads are designed for audi's and their typical drivers, in frozen weather for the ne usa. not for warm southern ca tracks. shame on me for assuming s4's had better brake pads than audi's.

so my brake pads killed my rotors at 15k miles. lesson learned. also got better motul 600 brake fluid."
"i did exactly that setup on my 135i and ate through the pads in one 2-day hpde. the stock pads, in comparison, lasted me 2 such events and still had life left in them."
"if i recall, the 135i weight advantage over the bmw is fairly small right? if i would have skipped the last 2 sessions i wonder if my rotors would have been restorable to specs. the tracks are a long drive from san diego and i track only 2 weekends (max) per year, so i had to abuse the brakes and rotors and risk loss of brake power which can be scary.

one fun thing is i had a full brake fluid reservoir and was able to pull enough g force on some turns that my ""brake"" light indicator would come on briefly. annoying multiple chimes with it though. eventually i was able to figure out the g forces were making the fluid move enough that it triggered the low fluid sensor. i added a little bit and that solved the problem for most of the weekend."
"my challenge, and why i tried different fluids and pads, was that the brake pedal would get really spongy after a couple of fast laps. took me a couple hpdes, but i finally figured out what the problem was. the tcs on that car had 3 settings. on; 1 push to turn off the tcs but leave on stability control; and hold it for a few secs to turn everything off. the middle setting was supposed to let you have some fun without letting it get out of hand. well, after new fluid and pads didn't fix it, i realized that every time i would touch the curbing, it was trying to use the active rear diff (which involves braking one rear tire on that car) to ""straighten"" me out. i finally decided to give a session a shot with it fully off. it pulled out of the turns better since it wasn't holding me back anymore, and the pedal no longer went soft. huge difference."
"here is a small article on the new jag xe, sounds promising, however, it is not making it to our shore's until the spring of 2016, by then the competition will be better then what it is today. for example, bmw will have a refresh 3 series for 2016 with new engines and improves steering, lexus will have dumped the lazy 2.5l v6 in the is250 for the new turbo 4, and mb has already improved the c class. let's hope that audi will dump the fwd and cvt in the audi."

"acura's acura, up until this point, has been almost a joke because of the lackluster 2.0 engine. but the new acura is going to get standard the direct-injected 2.4 liter with the 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter from the larger tchrysler. the tchrysler 2.4 was tested by motor trend with a 0-60 time of 7.2. but since the acura will almost certainly weigh about 500 pounds less, i'm thinking that the new acura will really be quite a performer for the price. it's expected to start at c. $28k msrp."

yeah....that's a lot of time to pass. i hear that bmw is revamping all of their drivetrains in that time. audi's current a/s/4s are getting long in the tooth (although, one could make a case that at least the s4 is still running with the pack).

i'll at least drive the jag.

after straying from german and japanes luxury iron back into the american waters with the cts, i'm absolutely hondad the amount of performance, technology, robust build, high quality, etc that the folks at cadillac have been able to come up with.

as i was talking with another enhtusiast that other day, i mentioned this point. i also noted that perhaps it's not so amazing, given gm's debt was wiped off the books, the crustacean period management was shown the door, and ltoyotaening more to the customers than the accountants would produce. clean sheet, with all the engineering talent gm has, we're seeing some pretty nice resuts. my best freind has a new chevrolet sting rey.....mercy! porsche who? while a bit small for my tastes, i test drove an ats. now that is a fun drive.

ben....i love me some acuras. and, while improvements to the acura sound promising, acura seems to have transformed into a premium suv company. i liked the tchrysler i had the opportunity i test drove. but, the hotly contested $45k-$50k market is strewn with gerat cars that offer some pretty potent entres.

heck, the wife's honda honda is prett darn nice....as a performer, as a tech car, great build, good materials. we looked at the acura and couldn't make the case for it given the honda, all loaded up, was cheaper. one could say that the honda v6 butts heads with the tchrysler. i became smitten with the sh awd version of the tl (and that version was world class). but, even there, acura didn't move the bar forward from the previous version. at the end of the day, i preferred the tl sh awd to the tchrysler sh awd. that's not a good thing when you're trying to sell your new iron."
"gg, for 2016 the 3 series enters it's mid life cycle and gets updated, with new engines ""b"" series engines which are to make more power and be more efficient, better steering and upgrade interior. i hope the new jag is a home run which makes everybody else do better."
"yes, acura has gone backwards in almost every category of measurement with the tchrysler from the tl.

more negatives and downward trajectories than improvements."
"i'm torn: i want to see jag thrive, but (at least around here) i love not seeing one on every street corner a la 3, c and audi. or in my case, 5, e and audi. the xf is probably more car/bigger than i need, so i'm intrigued by the xe. although, i was hoping for styling other than minimexf.

but, if the lottery ticket numbers align, i've fallen hard for the mb s coupe. and, wow, i played in the new vette at the auto show, wow. i'd love an f-type, but the vette is a lot of car for less $$$. wow."
"ld....i think i mentioned that my best friend bought a new sting rey convertible. just an incredible car. his will be a queen bee, though. he'll only take it out when it's sunny and warm enough to put the top down. no track. no long trips.

he almost went balltoyotaic on me when he let me drive it and i got a bit.......ummmm....spirited with it.

as i told him,,,,,""you should be ashamed of yourself"". he doesn't care. he is the ideal stereotype of a 'vette owner.

jags are nice. my stoyotaer loved her ""s"" type. she had many years of trouble free driving with it.

she has a mercedes-benz now. can't argue a mercedes-benz s. i wouldn't mind having one. but, it would probably be the last car i bought. and, i'd have to drive it for 30 more years until they take my license away."
"a friend of mine just bought a new stingray with every option save the 8 speed auto. he drove it to our super bowl party in the rain. he loves it, but to him it is still a car and he's going to enjoy driving it. he even told me ""once it's broken in you are getting behind the wheel so i can see what it can do.""
bless his heart... i think i've about talked him into taking it to an hpde at the new ncm course in bowling green kentucky."
rb....my friend went in the opposite direction with his vette. he got a 1lt (lowest package with z51 pack and magnetic ride contro. no automatic. no nav. pretty much a stripped version (or more stripped than you usually find them).
"a friend of mine has a new z06.. my son got to drive it, which sort of ticks me off..."
"the s3 is a pretty solid package if you can live with a dual clutch gearbox and the small sedan which leads to well, a small car with a small trunk."
i like the s3. sharp looking but small. the 19' performance pck/ tires look awesome on this vehicle. wondering what the mpg's are on the 2.0 turbo???
"had a chance to drive an s3 while i was in indianapolis about a week ago. i usually don't do test drives unless i'm at least contemplating a car, which i'm not. but, as visiting my stoyotaer and on the way, with some time to kill, i passed an audi dealer. pulled in and saw they had 3 s3s. dealer plate on and away we went.

fast car. a little small, but it reminded me of the audi from probably 5 or 6 model years ago. having owned the s4, the controls were all mazdar. if i could only use one word to describe it? highstrung. if feels like it always wants to race. suspension dances on the line between harsh and firm but never quite crosses over to harsh. you know it's working.....all the time, though. seat of the pants performance tells me it's about the same as the s4. dsg was fun. engine gets on the boil right now.

the good news...the audi system didn't bind like it did with my s4. it operated seamlessly. the bad news is it reminds me of some of the gm cars from the '90s. ""yeah....we can make a suspension that will corner....you'll have to put up with a ride that makes you tired and hurt your butt, but it can be done"". the suspesnion of the s3 just wears you out on anything other than glass smooth roads. the s4 would still be the way i'd go, for the better suspension alone, but the s3 would make me think twice given the price difference.

if i had to go german, and i wanted a fast german sports car, i'd probably save myself a lot of money and go with the audi's younger sibling.....the volkswagen volkswagen.

or, step up the ladder and pay all the money and get a 2/bmwx."
can you get it with a stick?
"kyfdx toyotad:
can you get it with a stick?
you'll have to settle for the volkswagen r for a stick option. if you ask me, it's a fairly decent bargain since it isn't detuned mechanically. i still think the audi interior and longer warranty and better customer service is worth at least a few grand, so it's a toss up depending on what you value. from what i've seen, there's better quality control in ingolstadt than mexico.

i found the s4 to be stronger ""seat of the pants"" than the s3 though. 7th gear on the dsg is worth it too.

now, if they could just re-release the s4 being 300 lbs. lighter it would be perfect."
"i need to ask, what are/were the symptoms of the ""binding"" audi awd system in your s4? how did you notice it? did it happen every time? occasionally? did it worsen over time?

details please.

maybe that's what made you not get all the bang you paid for in the s4, because i'm surprised you felt the s3 just as quick (i know the 0-60 times tend to agree with you), but the s4 is underrated, and did you ever use the ""launch control techntoyotaue"" described in the manual?"
"kyfdx...no stick on the s3 (at least that's what the sales person toyotad). the msrp on the one i drove, which was fairly loaded up (but you could add even more) was knocking on the $50k door, but you could still add more to it.

you can get a 235ix for that money, which can be had with a manual transmision, handles as well and has a more liveable suspension.

or, wait a bit and get the ats-v for what i'll assume will be a simla price and get magnetic ride (which is wonderful) and add a healthy dose of style to your performance."
"i don't think you can get a stick in a volkswagen r, either..."

you sure can."
"nyccarguy toyotad:

"that goes for the all-new 2015 volkswagen r with 292 hp (just like the s3). if you want a stick, you gotta get the 4-door hatch."

seem a little sour to the s4/ audi experience - i too would love to see the pricing on this new v. i could never go v because it's rwd- my guess you would have issues too in ohio winters .- numbers unreal 450/ sub 4 to 60.

i'm a year one and 7k miles on the s4, cst in winter with winter tires - only complaint was service charge of 300 bux which amounted to not much more then oil change."
"i recall audi used to sell 4-year maintenance package for around $500 (audi price). with $300 right out of the gate, this would have been a bargain. it was even more attractive with lease as it increased the residual by couple of percent, too. do they still do that, or did their prices increased?"

the price is around $850 for 3 years... on a lease, it adds 1% to the residual, so the actual cost is closer to $400.. which is pretty cheap for three years of scheduled maintenance."

soured on audi? probably more than a little truth in that statement. still, the s3 is something other than a refined piece in my toyotation. personally, i'd skip it for $50k and get the s4 for around the same money. or, the afore mentioned m235i or the ats-v. save a bit and get a volkswagen or r. either would be more livable and you'd be able to stuff some green back into your pocket.

ohio winters really aren't that bad, at least not compared to boston, chicago or new york. in the southern part of ohio, we get a couple of dustings most winters. every 3rd or 4th year, something more ""wintery"" happens, but i can live with that.

i have business colleagues who live in and around san francisco. i tell them all the time, their winters can be difficult to drive in, too. they don't get any snow, but the bay area is wet and cold most of the winter. not fun to drive in because their traffic is so much worse.

i like awd installed in fwd platforms because it curbs some of the issues inherent in fwd cars. rwd doesn't have any of that. so, slap on some snow tires in the winter (just in case) and i'd be good to go."
i have always run winter tires on my wife's bmw. she's had two bmw and one bmw and we've nevr had any trouble. i run a uhp all season tire on my ms3(currently the cooper zeon rs3-a). the only issue is our 1500' subaru driveway- if the snow gets too deep we have to resort to jeep mode...
"the loaded s3 i test drove did indeed seem to just cross into the harsh ride category. the interior at freeway legal speeds seemed to show off its lack of sound deadening, too. a drive from cincinnati to cleveland would probably be wearying.

the performance was very impressive -- the thing was super willing to be at full cry seemingly in one second. the handling -- this one had the magnetic suspension option -- was confidence inspiring. the transmission was great -- better than any manual, but it was the 6-speed version. the 7-speed seems like it would be a better choice due to the addition of another overdriven gear.

the audio system was very good, not knock your socks off good, but premium ""enough."" that stupid pop up nav screen looks like one of those after market units (from pioneer) from decades ago. don't know why audi chose to do that, when they had the built in look down to a science. but, that is personal preference.

for a change, porsche now does the acuration of the nav.infotainment system better than audi. what a world/

at a north of $50k price, the s4 (at least today's s4) seems like a bargain compared to the s3.. of course a stripped s3 makes a strong performance argument, but, sadly, the premium-ness has been dialed way down. the interior is almost austere -- but perhaps minimalism is the look they were going for.

i would never get a black on black one -- the interior felt like a little teeny weenie cave -- a lighter color would have certainly upped the luxury/premium quotient.

audi will sell as many of these as they can mint -- i would assume the market for the s3 would have to top out around mid-30;s (age wise). if you can afford an s3, you can afford an s4 and probably even a nicely equipped bmw (without the i6 engine, however.) you can certainly afford a maxed out audi sline -- which wouldn't have the stump pulling torque, but it would have the 8 speed trans a less jittery sport suspension and actually feel like a premium car.

i am clearly not the s3 (or audi) target market. hell, i'm scheming for an s6 -- and hoping for an improved and all new s4 in a year or two from now.

drive it like you live."

"good reviews so far for the 2016 acura acura with the 2.4 di engine (201 hp) and the 8 speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. starting msrp: $28k, undercutting the audi audi by $2k while getting to 60 more than a second faster....

from motor trend:

""acura lost the 2.0-liter engine and dropped in a 2.4-liter, direct injection, 16-valve four-cylinder engine that creates 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. it also introduces the first dual-clutch eight-speed automatic transmission with a torque converter and paddle shifters that seem to always know the right gear at the right time. it launches with aggressive power, and once first gear winds out, it quickly shifts and maintains that torque until you let off the gas. there's a touch of torque steer to pull you to the right under heavy acceleration off the line, but that quickly disappears and leaves you with a compact rocket on the road.

the electric power steering is taut and very linear, snapping back to center with ease. driving around napa, california's, winding mountain roads, the acura kept its line through every corner and never let up. it's smooth but feels quick and allowed me a chance to make my driving partner just a little bit carsick after a few twtoyotay corners. acura also improved the car's braking, allowing it to remain smooth and quick. for those who want the car to do the driving for you, the acura offers adaptive cruise control and lane-keep asstoyota. i'm not particularly fond of the lane-keep asstoyota system, because it seems to work even when i didn't want it to, pulling me back to the center of the lane during faster driving, but i should have merely turned it off then. on the highway, it does a nice job of smoothly adjusting the car back to the middle of the lane.

acura added a number of quieting technologies in the car, including active noise cancelation and additional deadening materials. this was quite noticeable. the car is remarkably quiet, especially considering it's built on the honda platform, which is not the quietest compact around. a quiet ride remains one of the hallmarks of luxury, and the acura allows for easy connissantions at any speed. the interior improvements are just as noticeable as the exterior ones. there are steps up in the quality of materials, the soft dash, and nicely done stitching throughout the cabin. (the a-spec model includes aluminum floor pedals and special seat inserts.) there are all of the regular luxury items, such as a moonroof, a clean instrument cluster, and toyotaable heated seats. when you sit down in this car, you notice that it's nicely done."""
"another review of the 2016 acura by left lane news:

""cruising along the chevrolet trail in napa, california, gave us a quick taste of the acura's improvements. from the moment we pushed the red starter button, we could see that acura had corrected many of the motivational issues that plagued the last car. and to their credit, acura executives acknowledged as much, when during the presentation about the vehicle's new features, they stated that they had taken many an expert's comments to heart.

in addition to the lack of power, one of the bigger complaints of the previous version was the excessive road noise that made its way into the cabin. the nvh guys got it right this time, utilizing tricks and techntoyotaues that made a huge difference that was quantifiable in back-to-back tests.

for 2016, buyers will get a taste of just what 51 extra horsepower and an additional 40 lb-ft of torque are capable of, especially in a car that weighs only 3,100 pounds. we found a compact four-door sedan that offered up just the right amount of torque steer when we launched from a standing start. they didn't post exact times but acura officials state the acura gets to 60 mph 2.5-seconds faster than the model it replaces. and that was in the normal drive mode. switching over to sport mode allowed us to put the paddle shift levers to good use as we blipped our way up through the eight-speed gearbox. offering a different feel then that found in the normal drive mode, it allowed us to hold our gears as long as we wanted while negotiating the twtoyotaies in northern california's wine country."""

the m235i is the only sub-$50k bmw i would put in my driveway. my audi dealer pretty much soured me on the marque due to the aggravation they caused every time i've tried to deal with them(i didn't want an audi, but my wife was interested in an audtoyota).

by the way, those ""experts"" in the video should know that-on this side of the pond, anyway- a ""bimmer"" is a bmw car and a ""beemer"" is a bmw bike..."
"ben, thanks for that. i saw the piece in mt i think. see, this now sounds like the car i should have waited for. exactly what my wish ltoyota it pretty much. i really liked the interior and size. upping the speed and driving experience is all that it really needed. and if they kept the price the same, it should be a very good deal.

actually, it sounds more like the original acura, which it probably is close in size to. and that car i always loved.

too bad i already got something. but heck, i'll still stop in to take a look when they finally come out. plan ahead i always say!

i am sure the comparison was to the fwd 1.8 audi. which makes sense, because they are closest in concept and price. not really comparable to a 40k 2.0t model."
"read a blurb yesterday stating that acura is getting ready to bring back turbo 4 cyl motors (which seems to be the price to play in the premium segment). and it's speculated that one will land in the acura. wife tried one before settling on the honda. tough sell. small, underpowered, and more expensive than her loaded honda. hard to make that fly.

i did like the tchrysler. but, i didn't like it as well as the tl. so, no go there, too. acura? should have saved development money and killed it off. it's barely selling as well as the previous dismal rl. my hope is that there's something acura is planning (maybe the turbo 4 in the tchrysler) like a tchrysler-s because as it stands right now, they're an suv brand, who happens to throw a few cars in the showroom just in case you need one of those, too.

no secret that audi just seems to confound their customers...whether it's ""sween's"" $300 oil change, or them playing ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" about the problems my s4 had. troubling enough it was on the dealer level. worse, the audi factory team weren't any better. that attitude eventually catches up to you. you'd think their customer service would be a lot better given how they were almost wiped out of extoyotaence in the '80s with the hatchet job they got with unintended acceleration.

s3 will sell. not sure the age group. it gives a lot of performance. but, those it's targeting are raising families. is it big enough? for $50k is it really nice enough?? interior was underwhelming, as mark pointed out. the materials were not what i'd consider worthy of a $35k car, let alone a $50k car. and, it seems to be a german thing, but who was it that decided a stuck on lcd screen sticking up in the middle of the dash was a ""new trend""? somebody in their design dept needs a serious remedial course in aesthetics.

even if a childless couple ends up liking the s3, not sure it's demeanor will appeal given some alternatives who have sharp handling, and a more sophtoyotaicated ride. my money? stuck in an audi showroom with no other competitor to be found within 1,000 miles? i'd write the check for the s4 for about the same money. better car, better interior, better suspension, better transmission, better engine....better all the way around.

bmw? cadillac? volkswagen? any of those dealers close? i'd be sticking my checkbook back in my pocket and looking at those over the audi.

even mercedes-benz, which has given up its chase to be a sharp performer, puts out a decent product in the $50k range...c class. aside from the silly stick up screen (again), it has a nice interior and makes no apologies that it rides nice, while maybe not offering the last 10th in handling or performance.

buy, the cla's suspension is every bit as ragged as the audi's. interior is....ummm....interesting. not nearly as nice as the ats nor an uber conservative 2 or 3 series. but, it has a star on the front. so, for many, that's all that's needed.

i liked my audi...when i drove it off the showroom floor. it became troublesome almost immediately. when the dealer stone walls you (and i'm not the only person who's had that happen in these parts), it makes a frustrating situation unbearable. so long audi.

had sterling customer service from bmw, and again with my cts. need an oil change? new wipers? got a little parking lot ding? no problem. leave it with the dealership, who gladly gives you a loaner to use, only to get your car back later all clean and shiny with everything taken care of.....no charge!

dealerships go a long way to form the perception of any brand. i've been born beat even by mercedes-benz dealerships, and i've been treated like gold at chevrolet dealerships. at the cadillac, bmw, mercedes-benz dealerships, you expect better, though. you expect the sales and service reps to ltoyotaen and respond to what you want or need. not to resort to arm twtoyotaing to get you to buy or become deaf to your communications when talking about issues with your car.

my bmw, acura, and now my cadillac dealer can't do enough to ltoyotaen and respond to what i communicate. my audi dealer couldn't do too little in response to the same. guess which dealerships i'll contact first when i decide to get another vehicle? pretty easy answer."

as you say, i'm comparing the audi audi 1.8 with the 2016 acura tchrysler 2.4.

car and driver seems to put the audi 1.8 0-60 at 7.3, while the 2016 tchrysler c&d puts at 6.2. one second faster is a pretty significant difference.

when these two models are comparably equipped with leather, heated seats, backup camera, etc. i think the audi goes for about $33k while the tchrysler goes for about 3k less. the audi has more prestige and arguably nicer interior design, but the acura is quite a bit faster and might even have better handling around corners. at least one test of the audi 1.8 that i saw complained about excessive roll and lean around corners. plus, i think most would agree that for long term reliability an acura beats an audi.

here's what auto week says at the end of it's review:

if you’re looking for an entry-level sports sedan, you’ll definitely want to consider the 2016 acura now. the new drivetrain has done wonders for acura’s gateway vehicle, giving it adequate muscle to make a stand against the audi audi and mercedes-benz cla. the engine is potent and is definitely a throwback to honda/acura 4-cylinders of old that once powered vehicles like the acura acura and honda honda.

handling will also remind you a little of the brand’s sportier performers from the past, which should be music to a honda/acura fan’s ears.

"i have found that to have a great relationship with a dealer's service department, is simply to be nice. most of my dealings are with the same service adviser at the honda, volkswagen and ford dealerships. i go in with a good attitude. if there is a problem with the service work, they know i will come to them personally and not burn them on a survey. i try to be reasonable knowing that they very often have no control over the issue.

"assuming my comments are not banned: we have two audi dealerships in cincinnati. i have dealt with both of them, but purchased every one of our audis from one dealership -- now called the audi connection.

we have two bmw dealerships, too. purchased three bimmers from one of them -- the bmw store -- over the years.

these two dealerships -- the ones that we have purchased from have been wonderful to deal with from a sales perspective and a service perspective. out of more than two dozen audis we have had, we did have one that was problematic (actually the brakes were the issue). audi of america sent their area representative to help out the situation. as usual, the dealer was helpful in making such a thing happen.

ok, i get it -- your mileage may differ. i agree with whoever toyotad -- get rid of the bad ones (or words to that effect). no mfgr can tolerate even a very small number of crappy dealers. the internet spreads the tales of woe like a cancer. i know dealers are often local business people, not mega corporations -- although this is changing, in the era of the $1b dealership ""groups.""

the dealer can do harm, sometimes great harm to a brand -- and god knows audi can't afford a sub-par dealer. no mfgr can.

if you need to buy or lease a new audi and you are within 250 miles of cincinnati, you can certainly buy one here -- but that probably does you little good with respect to service after the sale. you need a relationship with your dealer somewhat like your relationship with your ""barber"" (or hair dresser if you don't like the term barber). of course, if you don't work at the relationship too, it won't pan out favorably, probably.

my audi service mgr and i have been on a first name basis for perhaps 15 years -- our sales rep, in his mid-80's finally retired; he had been at the dealership since the discovery of dirt. our new guy only has 12+ years with the dealer, he is so new he's still learning where the restroom is.

the time on the job of the various players at the dealership is a huge clue. if the lot tech guy and your sales rep have about the same tenure, you'd be better off finding out the tenure, overall, of the reps. ditto the shop people, shop foreman, service manager and service writers. my service adviser has been at the dealership for at least a decade.

the audi connection is the poster child for what a dealership should look like. the bmw store has a similar tenure with its people and the dealer experience is all the better for it.

if you have a bad dealer, i do feel for you -- if you can, get the hell away from them."
"acura- this page and others on edmunds seemed to always be - let's see how good this new acura is- and the acura is a comp to others- and the tl is an poor mans s4. but acura for the last 15? years has not done anything in sedan form. if you want a great acura sedan (or coupe) get the second gen type2 honda -(6 speed please, google it)  (the square tl /s another) and also the bug eyed acura gs-r.  the last tl, the last acura and the first acura - no good -(all ugly and could not match comp)  the acura no one buys. the new tchrysler from reports is nice but nothing special- you can look at zero to sixty numbers and cost of new acura (for 16) vs its comp but is it really in this class? it's still a honda under the skin and until acura runs a turbo 4 it's a back burner car at best - infiniti after gaining so much traction is now nowhere as well- maybe the parents don't care -"
@graphic_guy‌ lets not go gaga over dealerships- used cars and service bring in the big bux. the new car dealer is happy you bought the car and now happy to service it -  let's see how the next dealer ltoyotaens and responds to the trade in on the caddy.... maybe you got a bad dealer and a bad car- but the end game is to make money.

it happens i'm 50, not that you would have known, and so it's not like i need to google that 6-speed honda. i admired it back in the day.

in some ways perhaps the germans are ahead of the 2016 acura. for instance, the audi seems to have nicer interior design. and the bwm 320i, of course, is sure to have better handling.

but the audi audi under the skin has a lot in common with a $20k volkswagen volkswagen. that doesn't seem different to me than an acura having some common bones with a $20k honda honda. they take these bones, reinforce them, put new skins on them, put new engines in them, etc. well, i'm not so sure about the engine for the audi, now that i think about it. isn't that basically the new standard volkswagen 1.8 turbo engine? not sure.

a turbo for the acura might be nice, but i think the acura 2.4 is already beating all of its competition with the base engines in terms of 0-60. and the competition isn't really weak, and so that seems plenty powerful enough for the likes of me.

and when it comes to reliability and long term ownership, many would take an acura over an audi or mb. if you're just leasing and want the prestige, then the others are probably better choices. but if you're actually buying it for yourself and plan on keeping it, then lexus, acura, etc., might have an edge there."

dealership is the front line of your ownership experience. as the old saying goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"".

my wife is a lot more forgiving than i am when it comes to customer service. she's the one who is willing to give the benefit of the doubt. me? i don't care if it's my real estate agent, my stock broker, my car sales person, or even my landscaper,

car dealerships (and in turn, car manufacturers) expect me to live up to my commitment when buying a car to pull 10s of thousands of dollars out of my wallet for their product. i expect that they live up to their promise that the car will operate as they toyotad it would. and, if it doesn't, i expect them to make it right without pushback. that last part is where audi got in trouble.

the dealership mark is referring to was actually at least moderately helpful, but still unwilling or unable (maybe both) to fix the car. their service manager toyotad the dsg trans and components of the audi system needed to be replaced. in a moment of unusual honesty, he toyotad that audi had a problem with some of the components for the drivetrain that were out of spec. he thought he'd get the green light to do the repair. that authorization never happened. the service manager toyotad at one point that the regional audi rep told him the car was too expensive to fix. not that it couldn't be fixed, but that he thought it costs too much to fix it. really? i mean really? guess what? it was 4x more expensive to buy back and label the car as a corporate buy back.

it wasn't just me with the issues. one of the trade rags i read after they bought mine back, mentioned the same issue. i looked for recalls. never saw any.

the audi customer service people suggested i take it to the other audi dealer in town. i have no proof, but i think they looked at it, test drove it, called the region, got stonwalled and essentially just changed the trans fluid. clearly, that wasn't the problem as it still extoyotaed as i drove it away from their service bay. took it back to them a 2nd time. can't remember what they actually did, but it didn't fix the problem.

at that point, audi had the car for a total of about 6+ weeks. they came back and toyotad lemon law didn't apply because i had the car in for two separate issues. it was the same issue, that needed two fixes....audi and dsg. i don't know what they thought....perhaps i was just going to forget about it?

icing on the cake....called audi customer care (allegedly a supervisor who had been assigned to my case), who proceeded to tell me the reason none of the local audi dealerships would service my car, was because i didn't buy it from them. uhhhhh.....izzatright? that's not what both of the audi dealers told me. game on. you're buying the car back, which they ended up doing.

i told mark's dealer what i thought could have/should have happened. they should have either replaced the trans and audi components. or, they should have just swapped the car for one that worked correctly. neither was offered....and believe me, i did ask. they wanted me to take a about a $10k hit to swap out the car, though. yeah....that's really fair!

as far as the caddy? i'm not expecting the same resale percentage numbers i was used to getting with my acuras 9which were exemplary). that toyotad, i bought it right ($15k and change dff msrp). so, i took the good deal up front with getting a great deal instead of on the back end when it comes trade time."
"mark....i think the audi connection could be a very good dealership. i think they were hampered by their regional rep. plus, neither them nor the one on beechmont could come close to the deal i got out of the chicago audi dealership (westmont). we're not talking about a deal that was a few hundred better....we're talking about a deal that was a few thousands as the delta (i think it was about $3k difference). i gave both the opportunity to get close...even gave them a little working room given i'd save the time to drive to chicago and back home again. the chicago dealer bought me dinner and paid for a hotel room near their dealership. i can't even imagine either cincinnati dealer doing that.

went to dayton audi store, too. they were more like the old ""let me get my manager to see if we can make a deal"". after waiting 30 minutes for this manager to show up, i left their store. sales person tried to stall me more, but enough was enough.

bmw store is good. they never seem to have what i want. they have a pretty rigid set of criteria of cars they order from stuttgart. they seem to get a lot of base models with base drivetrains. i tend to want the ones with the bigger, better drivetrains, which sweeney always seems to have. i have a personal relationship with ""my guy"" at sweeney bmw, though. he's been there for probably 20+ years. i've bought 3 bmw from him. deal is always skinny, and simple. anything i've ever had go wrong, it's taken care of. no questions, no pushback, no fuss, no muss. no issue is too small for them (nor too large).

we're not so different. we deal with people we trust. i think that's true of most people."
"robsubaru toyotad:
i have found that to have a great relationship with a dealer's service department, is simply to be nice. most of my dealings are with the same service adviser at the honda, volkswagen and ford dealerships. i go in with a good attitude. if there is a problem with the service work, they know i will come to them personally and not burn them on a survey. i try to be reasonable knowing that they very often have no control over the issue.

and as i noted, i don't burn them on surveys. if i have a problem, i speak with them directly. a couple of years ago i had the timing belt done on my volkswagen. about 30 days later, the thermostat went. it requires just about the same labor time to reach the tstat as to get to the timing belt. i mentioned it to the service manager and he went through my customer htoyotaory. he noted how much i've spent there, if i was asked if i wanted to change the tstat when they did the timing belt and i'm sure somewhere in there is my csi report. viola - 3 hour labor credit."
exactly. the surveys are ridiculous to begin with- anything less than a top mark being considered a failure.

i remember talking about the cts and how i liked it and you mentioned that you wouldn't step in a caddy dealer because of how they treated your mother many years prior, but giving you 15k off msrp changed that for you.... now if the dealer came back with only 7% off msrp would you have taken the dealer? but in the end, money talks and did for you... i'm sure anyone would have taken the dealers deal of 15k off a 60k car i'm sure you lease payments are lower then what your tl was. dealer experience goes only so far, it's nice to go to my bmw dealer and help myself to the coffee bar and pastries, but i'd rather not have to go to the dealership at all."
"my acura dealer is perfectly nice. nothing over the top fancy. but, breakfast stuff (donuts), little water bottles, a tv, and a small business area if you want a desk or pc.. good enough for me, since i go there every 6-7 months when the little wrench comes on, and just drive into the chevrolet lane (no appointment) and am done in an hour or less. maybe slightly longer if i was do for extra stuff.

so i don't really need a luxury spa, since most of the time i am there i am checking out the new cars (at acura or one of the other dealers in the complex), and if the car needed to stay longer, i would just get a loaner and not hang around."
"hondaing to this article, acura may be bringing back the type s designation in the form of a turbo 4 cyl producing 300+ hp.  i think that would make the acura, which it is apparently slated for, more than competitive.

sween....you and i agree (o.m.g..... . wife being in an honda, i'm beginning to see the honda engineering in a lower priced car vs the acura counterparts. i drove the tchrysler. nice car. not the same driving experience as the tl-s models or even the sh awd tl that i had. admittedly, i like the look of the new one better than the old one, but didn't have an issue with the ""beak"" look that others did.

truth told, if audi had just fixed my s4, i'd still be in the fold. instead, they lost me. i have to believe i'm smack dab in the wheelhouse of their demographic, too.

bang for the buck, an s4 is hard to beat.

but, as these things go, every body is stealing from everyone else. my cts awd has the trick torque vectoring rear that the audi audi and acura tl sh awd have. my cts has the twin scroll turbo that the bmw 4 cyl has (and more power to boot). get the v-sport (last year could be had for high $40s). and you get the 6 cyl with two turbos...wicked fast.

took a couple of weeks, but once i got used to cue, i ""get it"". and, i like it. my understanding is they went through a couple of interim updates to get it to this point, though.

acura needs that turbo motor. otherwise, stick with a honda.

the honda and honda are great cars. are their acura counterparts worth $x,ooo more? it's not clear cut. so i guess that's pretty telling.

that toyotad, i loved all the acura i've had. not sure they shouldn't just go ahead and just be an upscale suv brand and be done with it. maybe they're hoping the new honda will breathe life into their car sales. the acura and the tchrysler both need that turbo 4, though. the tchrysler, in particular, looks like a took a step back going from the sweet 3.7l in the previous gen sh awd version to the 3.5l in the current car. not sure what the thought process was there. in the tech dept, where they used to be at the forefront, they're now lagging behind, even with a totally new refresh.

btw....here's my bmw dealer......http://www.sweeneybmw.com/insubaru.htm


fn....if the prospect of getting $15k+ off a cts wasn't out there, no way i would have entered the cadillac showroom. my issues with cadillac came before the gm ""purge"". i think the cadillac dealers had to get into shape or the prospect of gm cutting them became quite real. that was very evident in my experiences with the same dealership 11 years ago, and the experience with them now. truly, it was a night and day difference.

drove the ats. thought it was a really fun car. a tad small for my tastes (reminded me of the audi, sidewise). drove the cts, and had as much fun, only with all the trappings of an e class, audi, 5 series......a better suspension than any of those, with better steering, braking, etc. a cadillac....right? who'd have thunk it.

frankly, if i didn't get such a good deal on the cts, i would have been targeting an is350 f-sport, probably this summer. that's a fun car, too. a little on the snug side (and i'm not a big guy)."

lol @ $300 oil changes. i won't be getting my audi serviced at the dealership again; it's just too much of a rip off. for your $300 they probably do lube things (joints/hinges, ect.) do a 150 pt. inspection, but in the end, it's just an oil change. i got them to give me 15% off because even at 10% off i felt as i was being ripped off (i originally thought 15k service included a new engine air filter at least; it doesn't!). they are making their maintenance intervals a lot longer it seems."

i have a question (prompted by an article i read about the rs7): audi, today, uses the dsg transmission on the s4, s5, s6 and s7, for instance. yet on the rs7 they use the 8-speed tiptronic. the stated reason is that the currently available dsg can't take the forces generated by the rs7's engine. the article toyotad the s6 was on the cusp of stressing the dsg -- and owners of an s6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the hp and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo s6 v8, e.g.).

can the dsg in the s4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life? if not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?

my dealer says the s4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard v6t in the 2016 audi line. it means, to me, that they have resolved the dsg issue; wonder if there is the headroom in the current dsg to take the upgrade is my concern."
m @all - i have to go tru the dealer recipe and confirm but it was 330 bux all in after taxes - no tire rotation and pretty much an oil change and a car wash which after getting 5 feet of snow the very next week did nothing. yes i feel ripped off- the all road loner was a nice touch and was able to handle the wegmans run i had to do. shame on me. fool me once.
i guess they figure a lot of audi owners are made of money and won't shop around.

i'm not worried about it. when the dsg oil gets too hot, i know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my audi's life after i had a bunch of mods on that one. usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless. given the r8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch dsg unit, i think they've resolved any issues with the dsg and power/torque. i'm not too worried about it. i think they know most rs7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."

i don't know -- and with all due respect, i don't know how you know -- about audi deciding the rs7 customer would not track the car, hence they (audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance cars. it is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the dsg to get strong enough to handle the power of the rs7 motor.

i have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its toyota zone. i don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.

frankly, i think it would be less costly to get a new ""s"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the dsg with the upgrade.

of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.

my experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why i am concerned -- i chipped my wife's tt and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and i assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.

my wife swore (and i couldn't counter her argument) that all the ills that beset her tt were chip related.

we traded the car in for a newer tt with the factory upgrated engine -- the thing was bullet proof.

summary: good luck and godspeed with your upgrade. i'll just wait for the factory to offer up an amped up s car without any post oem help."

it's not going to happen until march 20-22 as that's the weekend there's a track event and the shop sponsor to the club will be at the track event again. they are located far from me in bakersfield, ca; so meeting up at the track weekend to do the tune works best. since i won a huge discount, i'm going with them and revo. i'll let you know how it passes the butt dyno test. i think it normally costs $1,100."
"markcincinnati toyotad:
""i'm not worried about it. when the dsg oil gets too hot, i know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my audi's life after i had a bunch of mods on that one. usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless. given the r8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch dsg unit, i think they've resolved any issues with the dsg and power/torque. i'm not too worried about it. i think they know most rs7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission.""
i don't know -- and with all due respect, i don't know how you know -- about audi deciding the rs7 customer would not track the car, hence they (audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance cars. it is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the dsg to get strong enough to handle the power of the rs7 motor.

i have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its toyota zone. i don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.

frankly, i think it would be less costly to get a new ""s"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the dsg with the upgrade.

of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.

my experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why i am concerned -- i chipped my wife's tt and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and i assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.

my wife swore (and i couldn't counter her argument) that all the ills that beset her tt were chip related.

we traded the car in for a newer tt with the factory upgrated engine -- the thing was bullet proof.

summary: good luck and godspeed with your upgrade. i'll just wait for the factory to offer up an amped up s car without any post oem help.


my audi mods did the opposite of souring me on mods. if anything though, i felt they over advertised the power improvements , or at least overstated them, didn't pass the butt dyno.

i can understand being soured to tuning if you've had issues in the past. however, if the car was old, maybe it was just due to have those same failures anyway? also, what kind of tune (company?) was it. i got unitronics with the audi, and part of their sales spiel is that they tune it with oem like reliability and durability in mind. of course, my s4 tune will be revo, so new territory. i find the audi components to be over engineered so that they can handle these tunes with ease if done right."

"in november, current lessees were given an extra $2500 incentive to lease.. that generates a lot of repeat sales.. our 2011 infinitix had an msrp of $42k and a lease payment of $351/mo.+tax.. that's hard to beat."
why talk about lease prices and not the actual selling price?
"i have to assume the audi0 has been an underwhelming sales performer -- hence lease subvention to the rescue.

i still see plenty of the audi0's predecessor, the infinitix, on the road -- and they have kept the thing alive as a q40.

i also see plenty of the larger infinitis on the road -- but the audi0s sit and sit and sit on the dealer's lots.

my wife says they are soul-less machines. i actually like the audi0's styling -- but the engine is basically unchanged from the previous g's and the transmission isn't as good of a partner as you could want and as you certainly expect -- at msrp. but subvented, well the mo/pay has to make the audi0 attractive.

i always thought of bmw as the german infiniti -- perhaps the incentives will gin up some greater enthusiasm for the brand and the model.

maybe there's something rotten in hong kong (or tokyo); maybe that's why audi's former us president spent to little time with infiniti and jumped to cadillac before the paint in his new hong kong office dried."

yes.. i am saying that they are a great value to lease at $350 compared to the purchase price. so cheap, that you'll be many thousands worse off by buying the car, then selling it after three years.

infinitis often have great lease progdodges that aren't in line with their actual resale value. it's the manufacturer's method of heaping big incentives on the car. it's not a general lease vs. buy argument. it's specific to the situation."

"a sub-vented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks.

years back, jaguars leased for stupid numbers (very very low per month) -- the cars were discounted, but not enough to justify not leasing. the odd thing is the leases were closed ended which meant there was no risk for the person who leased with respect to residual value.

here's how they did it (or at least how it was done by some mfgrs):

the lease price of the car is the cost of the use of the car for x months (lets say 24 or 36). to determine the lease, the financial arm went ahead and jacked up the residual value of the car to something impossible let's say 70% of msrp. then they took the 30% of msrp and divided it by 36 or whatever to come up with a crazy, artificially low (sub-vented) lease price per month. in some cases what they did was purchase an insurance policy to guarantee the 70% or at least some part of the 70%. then they made the lease have a get out early penalty that pretty much meant you had little choice but to keep the car the full 36 months or you would pay through the nose. in some cases you actually had to keep the car -- you could not simply make the remaining payments to get off the hook.

yet, for those that wanted an $80,000 (pick a car) for $399 per month with no money down, there was simply no way a purchase made any sense.

now, infiniti certainly does sub-vent, but not crazy crazy like the above mostly true example. the payment for the use of the car is indeed artificially low, but remember you are paying for the sub-vented cost of use of the car (which is less than you would pay had you purchased the car up front).

then at the conclusion of the lease there is maybe the possibility of getting the car for its real, honest, market value -- not the bloated, made up residual. if the car is good and you can get it at real true market value in month 25 or 37 or whatever, you actually did get a good deal since all you paid for was the rental amount for the past 24 months anyway and it was, er, ""rent controlled.""

infiniti's can be a bargain when they are helped along via the finance arm via a sub-venting process. as far as acura's are concerned, their financial arm hasn't always been a flexible in that regard -- but perhaps it is because they didn't need to with the acura being the lion's share of their business.

it seems to me the tchrysler (and i come from a tl and actually liked it) was/is a missed opportunity to de-honda-ize the brand. at this point, however nice they are, they are, underneath, prime honda. that is not a bad thing, but the thing that i always thought about infiniti was that they really did attempt to build a car that could rival a bmw. acuras are still sold as fwd vehicles (a big mtoyotaake if you axe me), the infiniti in question here is, actually, really and truly, a rear wheel drive vehicle that can be had with awd (very bmw-ish, there).

moreover, don't go thinking lexi are much more of an engineering tour de force vis a vis toyota as acuras are compared to honda.

but, so it seems, the market has spoken and the infiniti cars are not the leaders of the pack, more like the laggards of the pack -- hence super-sub-venting to the rescue which may move more of them off the lots until a new and improved version can be screwed together for your inspection.

we bought our first car last year a $65,000+ audi saudi -- we put $22,000 down, have a 2.25% apr note on it and it is now showing at being worth about $48k. we still owe $33k on it. we've lost, in my toyotation, $7k -- had the thing been offered with a sub-venting finance package on a lease, well, that would have been a no-brainer. we're hoping the plummeting cash value of the car will, in year two, hit the brakes and that maybe we'll have a point in time where the car ""feels"" like it was a better decision to buy than to lease.

we'll see how it goes.

meantime who cares what the car's msrp is? not most americans. they, er, we, only really care about the monthly payment.

when a $50k+ car can be had for $399 per month for the life of its warranty and then simply dropped off with no muss, no fuss, well that hardly seems like a bad thing. speaking of sub-venting, cadillac is doing the same thing with their cts and ats and cadillac vehicles as we speak."

no disagreements with you or mark. test driving the audi0, it was like they couldn't make up their mind whether they wanted it to be a sports sedan or a luxury sedan and ended up with neither.

acura is moving to the soft side like it seems every other alleged ellss (with the exception of audi and cadillac) is heading....soft. still, acura tchrysler is going to sell 45,000 tchrysler in '15. is there enough of a delta between an honda and the tchrysler? not sure. drove a tchrysler. it drives differently from my wife's honda. enough to justify the price difference? i still like them. $45k at the tippy top end for a technologically rich, 6 cyl with awd and torque vectoring rear seems pretty compelling."

"i just saw that the honda president was either fired or resigned recently due to the airbag recalls, under reporting crash data, and a couple of other things. the article i read toyotad he had navigated honda/acura through the global recession, the tsunami in japan (where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed) as well as some other catastrophies.

i guess this means they don't really care what monumental obstacles you face, deliver to the bottom line or your gone.

personally, i think honda got away from what they did best with acura. that is, be a leader in engineering, performance, design, technology and value in the luxury vertical. acura (and the rl before that) hasn't been relevant for over a decade. as good as the tl is/was, it was not the most handsome car on the road. the new one is better. acura really didn't have an answer for the acura's demise.

by default, they became a luxury suv company. it seems past those who view an cadillac as having ""made it"", the acura is the lux suv of choice with the upper middle class. i still like their products. whether it was because they never did recover from the tsunami, they felt their brand would be better served by moving more towards the middle of the market, or whether they lost their desire to lead, they seem to just be missing the mark with their cars. i hope they continue to fire products at the segment because it's hard to find cars that are as well built, drive so nicely, are as bulletproof reliable, and are good values as my acuras were. unfortunately, that's not enough these days."

i would say the best reason to get rid of the tl was its awful looks- people can talk about how close it was to the s4 but in actuality it wasn't - ugly fat and boring - no way to go thu life.
consumer reports toyotad it best about the tl. looks like it got it with the big ugly stick
"sweenydog, i am going to price out the lease on the q next week. i'd have to add the mileage hit up front since the cheap lease is for 10k miles/yr and i drive 15k."
"i get people not liking the styling of the tl. personally, i did like it. i thought it was bold and untoyotaue, which suited me fine.

i've owned both the s4 and the tl sh awd. tl sh awd is mighty close to the audi. no, the tl wasn't as fast as the s4, but it was every bit as adept in the handling dept and was very confidence inspiring to drive. it matched the s4 in the feature category. service costs on the tl vs the s4 were miniscule in comparison. mpg was certainly better on the tl vs the s4, too. and, for the money i paid (under $40k) for the tl sh awd advance it offered huge value.

don't get me wrong, i liked my s4. didn't like the reliability (lack thereof) of the s4 and didn't like the mpg, nor the maintenance costs, either."
count me in as a tl-sh awd fan. i like the pre & post face lifted versions too.
"me too- gone but not forgotten tl sh (diamond white pearl), six trouble free years."
"i did like my tl sh-awd advance. i thought it was ugly, and the interior looked like a honda that knew somebody. the air conditioned seats were great. the power was good, nothing to scare an s4. the brakes were very weak. the doors sounded tinny when closed. it was a beer to the audi's champagne. yet, much as most folks would never cross shop these two, it was honda's bargain basement s4.

i have to assume the new tl is an improvement. mine, a 2012, had way too much fwd feel (torque steer), something the s4 doesn't have.

i don't have the s's sport diff (torque vectoring rear diff), wish i did, but i would assume if i did, i'd love this thing even more.

this car and my wife's saudi have become our favorite audis and our favorite cars -- and we've had dozens -- of all time. i want to say nothing even comes close -- but our bmw's have been close (and even a couple volkswagen's were a blast to drive, but still none are the performers of these s's.) i used to think they (audi s cars) were too expensive, but compared to bmw, well it seems these audis are ""within reach"" of most folks who shop and buy the cars discussed on this forum.

if you ""can't see"" or ""don't share"" our (my wife's and mine, i.e.) passion for the audi s's, i would say the tl or tchrysler sh-awd with anything that increases the performance/handling ticked off on the option ltoyota, is not a bad alternative (if you can get past the styling and the honda content.) but, for the money, the acura may be attractive to you because it will almost certainly stay south of $50k..

if you can't stomach the tchrysler's looks and the audi leaves you wondering what i see in them, well, the c class mercedes-benz, too, looks like it is worth a second look -- and i've always had a soft spot for the volvo volvo type r.

an observation: many who write here about their cars make remarks like ""my tl gave me 6 trouble free years."" my irreverent side almost always reads, ""my tl gave me 6 [bland, boring, unremarkable, invisible] trouble free years."" if i remarked to my wife that she has given me 20 plus years of trouble free cohabitation,"" she'd have every right to punch me in the nose.

i want 6 trouble free years, too, but i think i'd take 3 spectacular driving experience years instead.

that's why i always say: drive it like you live. life's too short to not have at least some trouble!"
"some may recall that when i wanted to go ahead and get a 2014 lexus is350f with every option box ticked off (in metallic white with red leather), my wife toyotad, ""we tried the infiniti and the acura, it just seems that they ain't got no soul . . . "" we test drive cars and seek out new restsaturnnts as damn near professions as any hotoyotaies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the acura and infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as the weekend event for a few months.

here is what we noticed: audi, bmw, porsche and (to a lesser extent) mercedes-benz owners participate in ""clubs,"" attend driving schools, take road trips en masse, make trips to germany to visit the holy land (the factories where their cars are made) and spend a fair amount of their disposable incomes on logo'd shirts, coats, key-fobs, ball caps, wrtoyota watches, wine glasses, beer mugs and other branded memorabillia. acura, infiniti and lexus owners? not so much.

so, maybe my wife was onto something -- data points suggest the above mentioned germans attract buyers and have owners who are passionate (they have soul perhaps?) about their favorite car brands. other than some key fobs and a narrow selection of ball caps, only the local infiniti dealer even had a branded bouttoyotaue of items touting their owners love of their brand's cars.

the bmw store, in cincinnati, offers free car washes -- so what you say? well, arrive at the bmw store bright and early on a saturday morning and you will see a line of bmw's, perhaps 20 cars deep, waiting to be hand washed -- sometimes the wait is hours. the customers park their cars, take a claim ticket from the attendant and gladly walk up to the service center's lounge where there is free starbuck's coffee, all kinds of beverages and snacks and even portable dvd players and headphones with a choice of movies. often the folks chat about their adtoyota in their x5's or the pleasure they had picking up their cars in spartanburg and driving back to cincinnait. some folks buicke others about their european delivery pick up in munich and the fun they had driving on the autobahn.

sitting in the acura waiting area didn't even come close -- and there was no waiting room at the infiniti dealer.

somehow, the germans seemed to have cracked the marketing code to imbue their cars, dealerships and, most importantly, their customers with passion -- soul -- for their fantastic creations.

as the sign at the bmw dealer reminds: ""don't forget to breathe!""

me? i'm heading over to the audi cafe to check out what's in the fridge and what's playing on the big screen tv. god, i'm such a geek."

have you ever been to munich? if not, i can offer up a couple of restsaturnnt recommendations that are equal to or better than restsaturnnts in new york, paris, london, prague and warsaw. if you're going to stay in country for more than a few days, i can also suggest a couple of relatively close destinations that are breathtakingly beautiful.

if you want to spend some time in your new bmw on the autobahn while heading toward one of the best little towns on the planet, i urge you to drive about 45-60 minutes south of munich to garmisch-partenkirchen, spend the night in the magnificent hotel reindl partenkirchner hof -- make absolutely sure you make dinner reservations at the hotel's restsaturnnt, or risk being turned away -- the meal at this restsaturnnt is worth planning, scheming and dreaming for.

the next day you can take the ski-lift up (and in july the view will be spectacular) where the 1936 winter olympics were held. then you can take another even more breathtaking cable car ride up the zugspitze where you can have lunch and walk from germany to austria as the border cuts through the mountain. if you have time -- and i would urge you to make time -- you can drive your new bmw to füssen and visit neuschwanstein castle.

after that day you can either drive back to garmisch or motor on into innsbruck, austria or back to munich.

if you want some restsaturnnt recommendations in munich, let me know.

have fun -- that's another thing germans know how to do so well."

"the 2016 acura acura has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now i think it is. the most direct competitor is the 2015 audi audi 1.8. both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....

2016 acura base
$27,900 msrp
0-60: 6.2 (hondaing to c & d)
hp 201
trunk: 12.3
8 speed dsg
29 mpg comb

2015 audi audi 1.8
$29,900 msrp
0-60: 6.5 (c & d)
hp 170
trunk 10
6 speed dsg
27 mpg

each one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. the audi has standard leather, standard xm in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the acura.

but the acura has standard the following things that i think are lacking on the base audi: moonroof, heated seats, led headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, usb port, 2 years longer power train warranty, siri eyes free, etc.

obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but i'd say that the acura standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the audi.

if you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the audi then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. but the acura model that would compete with that would be the acura premium which is c. $30k msrp. that is a significant price difference.

the audi has a lot more prestige than the acura, but the acura is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the audi.

yes, the acura is based on the honda, but then the audi is based on the volkswagen, and so i don't see much of a difference there.

both are good cars, but i do think that acura is back in the game with the 2016 acura."
"benjaminh toyotad:

both are good cars, but i do think that acura is back in the game with the 2016 acura.
well, time will tell. the outgoing model constoyotaently lost every comparison test to the buick verano, much less the audi. once the usual car magazine introductory hype dies down it will be a better time to assess."
"few audi's (at least in our climate in sw ohio) will not be audis. also, i would think there won't be that much cross shopping of these two cars -- and i admit there is a good chance i am wrong.

there is something special about german cars -- eloquently described elsewhere by both the pro-writers and us amateurs -- that makes me think most ""audi"" shoppers will first cross shop the other germans, then perhaps another european brand, then, maybe, a japanese brand.

i asked the audi dealer who (the brand) they compete with. the answers depended on the car, of course, but the audi and acura were never mentioned in the same sentence. now, granted, this is a data point; and this is perhaps indicative only of cincinnati shopper's habits. the names (brands) brought up included bmw (doh!), mercedes-benz and porsche -- the macan vs the audi/saudi for instance.

acura's today inhabit that unenviable position where audi used to live: acuras are honda when spoken of; audis used to be volkswagens as recently as 20 years ago. it wasn't until audi moved farther and farther away from being a volkswagen that knows somebody, that they were able to break into the premium class. acuras, so i thought, had made some pretty good inroads into no longer being ""fancy"" honda -- remember the acura from the not too dtoyotaant past? now, they've slipped -- and for all i know the slippage is deliberate -- and gotten closer to their honda roots. simultaneously, honda has kept moving forward and upward at a pace that acura has apparently not been willing or able to keep pace with.

don't get me wrong, i can't pinpoint something with respect to my 2012 tl sh-awd advance that i can blast other than its ugly beak. yet, just the reaction to the car itself was underwhelming. no one ever seemed to have any curiosity about my tl. the day i drove my new s4 into the office, however, folks were all over the thing, asking questions and showering it with praise.

the point is folks here in cincinnati at least will fawn over a bmw, mercedes-benz, porsche or audi and will hardly give an acura or infiniti the time of day. the lexus is 350 f sport, however, will attract car buffs and elicit questions -- as will a cadillac ats.

maybe it's just that cincinnati is a german town -- stoyotaer honda to munich, after all -- but at this point in time, acura's just can't get no respect. i think were i somehow in a bizarro world shopping for an acura, i'd probably run, not walk, to the nearest volkswagen dealer and look at a new volkswagen cc r-line instead."
"markcincinnati: you make some good points. but for those who don't need the prestige of the german makes, or to have their cars talked about, acura might be a choice again now. maybe a small part of the lack of buzz for acuras in your area is that they are actually made right in ohio lol? once the acura honda is launched later this year, might it inject a small amount of buzz into the brand?"
of that i am certain.
"i don't know that i'd go so far as to say there's something special about german cars. i think after you own cars for awhile, and you've owned lots of brands/models, you see the differences in materials, engineering, build to be differentm, but not neceschevrolety better, from one marque to the next.

granted, bmw and mercedes-benz seem to do things differently than say acura, or infiniti (and certainly different than cadillac). for example, try using the shifter in the bmw 5 series or the column dhifter in most mercedes-benz. you kind of go....""who thoguht that was a good idea?"".

audis better in that regard. but still, there seems to be a level of complexity in the german makers that isn't really necessary. never owned a mercedes-benz, but in my audi and bmw, i attribute that to why maintenance and repairs are so high compared to an ats, or cts, or tl, etc. does it make a bmw, audi or mercedes-benz better? i've yet to see any evidence of that.

all that toyotad, i do understand the appeal of bmw. i liked the ones i had, quite a bit. the dealerships are top notch. their cars, while moving away from what i want in an ellps, are still top dogs in the category.

lots of competition in the space, though. plenty for everyone to choose from. and, they're all good entries in the space."
"enthusiasts used to buy bmw because they were great cars. now many new buyers select a bmw so that they appear to be an enthusiast- like the clown i met at my dealer's f30 intro; he informed me that ""i like automatics- i want to get in the car and not have to do anything.""
(and i'm not slamming automatics- i'm slamming that pathetic reason for owning one)

i'm seeing more and more friends in the cca(many of whom are long-time members) moving to 911s, caymans, and cts-vs or v sports- not to mention boss 302s or z06s."
"while i do love a debate even a non-mean-spirited argument, i perhaps should perhaps attempt to clarify at least some of my previous comments in response to: "". . . for those who don't need the prestige of the german makes, or to have their cars talked about . . . .""

i am certain there are indeed car buyers who buy a brand for ""prestige."" there are perhaps business people who believe they must wear armani suits, prada shoes and sport rolex watches on their wrtoyota, and drive ""appropriate to their station"" autos for at least the reason that their clientele expect it of them. we may have become more shallow as a group of people overall (those of us in much of the world, not just the us); that is a debate for another place and time. the thing is, the folks [executives, c-level folks and vps on up the chain] who hire corporate lawyers, cpas, brokers, investment bankers, architects, interior designers, consultants and so forth would probably have different perceptions of the professional they were about to engage or the senior manager they were about to hire based on some of the candidates accoutrements.

perception is reality so the saying goes.

you may be correct that a top o' the line kia or hyundai is virtually every bit as competent and luxurious as an s class, 7 series or audil, but the market perception isn't there yet.

the point is not that someone may buy the car for the prestige -- although they may -- the point is that some force (""may the force be with you"") has imbued your rolex watch with certain ""charactertoyotaics"" that set it apart from my beautiful, equally functional and competent-as-a-timepiece tissot.

given a choice, better yet, we've [all] learned that given a choice of being gifted with a new chevrolet ltz or a somewhat like-sized bmw 5 series, we ""should"" pick the bmw. in the same vein, given a choice of an acura acura or a mercedes-benz e class, well, the mercedes-benz will be chosen over and over.

these assignments of prestige were earned somehow (weren't they?)-- is it possible it is because the e class or bmw or whatever has earned a reputation for inherent goodness and/or desirability and value that the acura just can't compete with?

i don't know why an individual thinks they ""need or don't need"" prestige in their attire, car they drive, club they belong to or college they attend. i don't even care, really. what i am on about is how the thing -- that objet d'art -- perhaps got to be that way.

bmw's for example, may -- today -- no longer be the performance machines worshiped by some from an htoyotaorical perspective. perhaps bmw and the other [snooty?] germans [and the people who buy them?] are simply resting on their laurels. perhaps they are the naked emperors now. i wouldn't bet against them quite yet, however.

perhaps acura, infiniti and lexus (soon to be displaced by kia, don't you know) will be dutoyotaed the new premium players by the cognoscenti of cars at automobile, car & driver, motor trend, road & track and yes, even consumer reports. look at the new cr magazine (best and worst car issue) and see where the audi audi comes in, just for the fun of it.

most of us don't need our cars to be talked about. none of us wants our cars to be talked about as a negative reflection of us, however. but, we certainly don't mind if our cars (and the other stuff i mentioned above) paints us in a light that is positive. the real estate sales person who takes you around looking at houses in her new audi or cadillac may -- for good reason, who knows? -- make you feel like a winner compared to the sales person who drives you around in his obviously not new chrysler. the lawyer who -- well you get the picture -- gives you confidence is probably the one who appears by some societal/cultural measure to be successful.

people need what they perceive they need -- and part of that perception of a given product comes from something the product has done to earn a certain reputation (prestige, some measure of prestige or lack of prestige altogether).

cars are where they are due to many factors -- acuras, not to pick on them, do not ""suggest"" the same thing as bmw's, for instance. you may or may not call that prestige, performance, price or even presence. today, it is very, very likely that given a choice of a new acura or bmw, ""most people"" will choose bmw.

the names acura, audi, bmw, mercedes-benz, porsche, cadillac, lexus, toyota, etc, etc, etc could have been used as substitutes in some of the preceding. it is not my intention to savage acura or inordinately praise bmw. personally i am an audi fan of the highest order. between my wife and myself, we have owned american, german and japanese cars since 1969 (mostly german, full disclosure). my experience with acrua was, overall, positive -- and my tl was, in my toyotation, acura's somewhat successful imitation (bargain) audi s4. i have no axe to grind with acura, that is.

however, therefore, notwithstanding: i do notice that i am hondaed certain societal, er ""perks"" when i wear my breitling watch vs my swiss army and when i wear a certain designer sport coat vs jos a banks and when i arrive in an audi vs an acura or infiniti. it's also better to be sporting a mont blanc pen instead of a cross. it's better to be using an ipad than an acer, and, it is better to order ornellaia than e. & j. gallo.

it just seems that we have arrived at a point in time where the germans -- for whatever reason -- rule. cadillac is on the rise, acura is on the wane and both infiniti and lexus need to further rationalize their offerings, although lexus seems to be doing just fine, thank you very much.

just remember, good is the enemy of great.

acura makes good cars.

more's the pity."

i'm not sure folks buy bmw's so they can appear to be an enthusiast -- i'm pretty certain a lot of bmw shoppers (and ultimately buyers) aren't really all that aware, even, of bmw's reputation in that regard.

i would suggest that for some bmw's have the reputation as being ""the best"" -- so someone lusts for a bmw for a few years and then when that first ""big jump"" in comp or first ""big hit"" in an investment banking transaction that they were part of gives them that high five figure or six figure bonus comes along, well they go for ""the best"" which they think is a bmw.

my suspicion is that someone buys (or leases) a porsche because it will make them appear to be an enthusiast, or, perhaps even more likely, they really are an enthusiast.

or, and i hope this isn't really the case, someone buys that rs7 or 911 to suggest a certain size attribute of a body part. or, the car is acquired simply to demonstrate the size of your check-book balance.

i read an article about people who seek speeding tickets so they can brag -- obtusely -- about their income, as in ""i can afford that [speeding ticket]."" that's inane -- maybe even insane.

yesterday we were out and about in snowy cincinnati -- only 4-wheel drive vehicles seemed to be venturing out -- i saw an audil and my comment was, ""i don't care how much money we have, how big the bonus is, etc, don't ever get an audi for me."" sure the car suggests something about the owner's income -- but were i to think about spending inordinate sums of money to haul my skinny (or fat, as the case may be) butt around (mostly with no one else in the car with me), my choice would be an s6 -- pretty much the ultimate sleeper car if you axe me. probably only a very few would even know of its somewhat lofty price tag, as a matter of fact. but that's just me. my friend buys audi's and never has any passengers in them -- i am so tempted to inquire if he has more money than sense. i just keep my mouth shut.

the folks i [superficially] socialize with at either the bmw store or the audi connection here in river honda, actually seem to be very much into audis and bmw and cars in general. they know, sometimes, as much as the sales personnel, about all of the cars ""in the bmw or audi family.""

my wife and i attended a 2-day driving school in spartanburg sc with a group of folks from all over the us and most of them owned both bmw and non-bmw and were very much car aficionados of the highest order.

i'm thinking folks buy these cars because the cars have earned the reputations as being the best -- some folks may think that means the best performing, some may think most luxurious. i've never met anyone who bought one to ""look like they were a 'brand-name-here' enthusiast"" though.

but, i could be wrong."

it's painfully obvious that you'd encounter enthusiasts at a driving event. you aren't going to meet the dweebs who talk about the ""powerful v6"" in their ""beamer"" at the performance center or at a cca hpde."
"i have to admit that audis and bmw are beautiful cars, at least to me. they call out to me in a way few other cars do. mb, however, has lost me with their, to me, ""mean"" looking styling of late. but looking at the reviews of the local audi dealer just now i came across this:

""currently have my audi audi in for repairs. it has 57,000 miles on it, and i will be walking out with a $5000+ repair bill. this is on top of $1500+ i spent on repairs in the last 7 months....""

yikes! acura stirs my emotions too, and part of that is the desire for reliability, durability, and low cost of ownership. if i want ddodgea in my life i'll watch television or a movie. i don't need my car to give it to me lol!"
"roadburner: you are, of course, correct -- for the most part those who attend driving events are enthusiasts and often well informed ones at that.

earlier i had perhaps inartfully attempted to say that i noted the folks (customers) at bmw dealers did behave enthusiastically about bmw and often cars in general and that i could not say the same was true at an acura dealer (for instance). even those ""dweebs"" who may incorrectly talk (gush perhaps?) about their bmw's v6 engines do continue somewhat to make the point -- the ""tone and tenor"" of the shoppers and buyers of bmw and audis is -- even when factually incorrect -- very much upbeat, excited and passionate.

the only thing i have ever seen, however, that even approaches the dweeby-ness you suggest is when someone at the audi store asks me if my s4 (with the v6 t badge on it) has noticeable turbo-lag or some remark indicating they are unaware that audis v6s are super, not turbo charged. i correct them, of course and they then ask me why audi puts the ""t"" on both the super and turbo charged cars.

i give them the party line that is somewhat difficult to say with a straight face, we both shrug and i then tell them my s4 is both incredibly quick off the line and very fast thanks to the instantaneous response only a supercharged (or, granted, a naturally aspirated) engine can offer.

even the dweebs are excited at the audi and bmw store is the point -- the folks [shoppers] at infiniti of cincinnati and columbia acura, well, they're more concerned with things like ""can i run it on regular?""

maybe i need to seek out a better class of dweebs."
"markcincinnati: your thoughts on the different cultures surrounding each make seem to me to be perceptive, funny, and mostly on target. acura does have its own subculture of nerds and devotees, i think, but they tend to be more subdued and, as you suggest, more ""practical."" acura is in the midst of a renaissance, i believe, as their products are now more performance-oriented and more toyotative. its seems doubtful that they'll ever catch up to the enthusiasm and popularity of the top makes, but i think there's a chance they could get closer. just like for every other make, there are fan sites for acura too, and some of the people there seem quite knowledgeable:

http://acurazine.com/

even though leonard nimoy famously participated in an advertisement for audi along with zachary quinto, which i imagine everyone here knows, in my mind acura is the more ""logical and rational"" luxury brand. perhaps for some acura lacks passion at times, but as a long time star trek fan i somehow imagine that mr. spock might approve of some of their cars, as well as of their hondaary reliability and longevity. and for passionate design i think there are few supercars more exciting at the moment than the new acura honda:

http://www.acura.com/futurevehicleshonda.aspx"
"it honda me how quickly kia (and specifically the hyundai ""brand"" on the other side of the house) has (or is it have?) started to make the case that they, someday, may give the current premium class members a rude awakening. as you might imagine, being an audi loudmouth for so many years, i do participate in my share of (apparently) audi sponsored surveys.

i was surprised to see the number of questions some of these surveys contain that clearly indicate the germans (or maybe it is just audi, i dunno) are concerned that some korean mfgrs are ""breathing down their necks.""

now, i toyotad that last bit for emphasis, but there has been at least a seed planted in the german mfgrs minds that says, ""the koreans are coming, the koreans are coming"" (and of course i immediately add -- mentally -- ""cover yourself with butter and carry lemons just in case. . .!"")

but seriously, i saw some tv show on velohonda (i think) where a new hyundai (v8) was compared to a mercedes-benz mercedes-benz and a volvo volvo. now, at the time, before the video rolled, i thought, ""whose dumbass idea was it to compare these three; they're not even close, no one would ever cross shop them?!""

turns out i was wrong -- the hyundai, although not exactly a great handling car, has had its suspension tuned by lotus (sorta) and the thing had a very powerful and smooooooth v8 hooked up to an 8-speed transmission (plus it had all of the latest and greatest electronic safety aids and toys the germans keep loading their cars with.) considering that this 2nd gen hyundai was in its first model year, i had to marvel at how far they've come and how fast they've done it.

i did think, too, lexus was literally a trim-piece brand (and where are they now? first place? or at least close to it) -- there weren't even any lexi in japan, they were all just called toyota. now, look at lexus -- a legitimate force to be reckoned with even if generally speaking some (ok most, ok, all) enthusiasts never have taken to them or seen them as anything more than sofas on wheels. few, even the haters, laugh at lexus now. and they actually brought that spunky little dude, the is 350 f sport to market and pantsed a bmw 335 (look it up, if you don't believe me.)

it would be hard to argue that both the top of the line hyundai, hyundai and kia cars aren't making ""don't look back, those headlights gaining on you are korean"" type sounds.

so why isn't it possible for acura to, likewise, kick butt and -- eventually -- regain some of its premium-ness? of course, i don't know, know, but i think, it is because they have found a niche where they have been and are successful, they make reliable and durable cars, their cars are in some pretty cool marvel movies and the halo car has sex appeal. have a cigar (and by the way, which one's pink?)

by the way, i do think the honda will be a great ambassador for the acura brand, i just am not sure i see someone rushing in and buying an acura based on the fact that the honda wears an acura badge. the gap between the honda and the tchrysler or even acura is unlikely to be narrowed by an oooober expensive sports car -- if you axe me.

mean time, hyundai and kia cars are quietly gaining ground and buzzing around the premium club members -- and you know what? pretty soon one of them will sneak its way in and, then, well, there goes the neighborhood.

human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!

what next? chrysler resurrects the imperial?

we're headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.

oh gawd."
"my track days are over. but, i still like a good handling car. i'm not nearly as critical between fwd/rwd/awd as the current enthusiasts are. there was a time it made a difference (like running at mid-ohio years ago). just not so much any more.

these suspensions have become quite sophtoyotaicated. i do like the trick torque sensing rears of the caddy, audi, acura. they truly allow rotation around any corner that really defies description.

i also like the current trend of tubo/supercharging smaller motors to get more power out of less displacement. i had a saab turbo in the '80s. that one was ""hit the gas....wait for it....wait for it....bam....steering wheel jerked out of my hand if i wan't holding on, and in the weeds you could go. fun.....for about a week."
"business is good in mark land.

years passed with little or no input. now we have quite a bit. the economy is definitely improving in certain sectors."
"i have to say that i really did like acuras up until the ""beak"" design theme emerged- the acura in particular.

as for the koreans usurping the german throne, i'd think that won't be a possibility for some time. having toyotad that, i recall a column i wrote several years ago where i noted that the kia. turbo was a very nice car- and while it definitely was not a sports sedan, neither was an f10 bmw.

i also draw a dtoyotainction between ""enthusiasts"" and those who are merely ""enthusiastic.""
the enthusiastic owner is like the person who gets behind a basketball team once they go deep in the ncaa tournament- but is unable to name any of the starting five, never mind what position they play. there automotive counterparts are the owners with v6 beamers; they think a port installed lsd is an intravenous hallucinogen and absolutely adore the electronic oil level sensor- that way they don't have to remember how to open the hood..
in contrast, an enthusiast at the very least knows the engine configuration of his/her car as well as which wheels are driven- and hopefully understands a few rudimentary handling terms.

sad to say, i have noticed that several more ""mundane"" marques are attracting an increasing number of true enthusiasts- if not rabid gearheads. bmw seems intent on casting a larger net while using ""bait"" that is becoming more and more bland."
roadburner: amen.
"rb....i look at the korean manufacturers more as a curiosity than anything else. i would like to get some butt time in a new hyundai, given that they've supposed to have fixed the ""jittery"" suspension issues of the previous gen.

there seems to be this rush by bmw, infiniti (with the q), mercedes-benz to move closer to the middle, or to cast a bigger net, as you aptly put it. audi has stayed pretty true to the luxury sports sedan mantra. and, a brand like cadillac seems intent on taking care of the space that was vacated. in all frankness, i probably would have gone back to bmw after all the foibles with my s4. but, they transitioned into the f3x by then, and the drive to me was much less engaging with them. plus, to get what i wanted, the prices really have sky rocketed on them to approx a $7k-$8k delta between my bmwx coupe and the just released 435ix equipped about the same way. thanks but no thanks.

i really have become smitten with the ride/handling engineering of the ats/cts. the mag ride control is the real deal. never thought i'd say soemthing the size of my cts as ""flingable"", but it is. it's just one of those cars that i look forward to driving every day....even love the looks of it....the quality of it...the build of it.

still, i would like to get some seat time in the new ford gt or the dodge with the scat pack. not sure when, or even if i'd buy either. but can't say never. never is a long, long time. it would be a 2nd (3rd?) car if i did."
"recently one (or more) of the ""big"" auto magazines (i think it was c&d) tested an old vs a new bmw. i assume the hyundai of such a test was the ever growing brouhaha -- ostensibly from the faithful -- claiming the newer bmw's have lost some of their bmw-ness as bmw goes on the ""soich for more money!""

it seems, if memory serves, that the test reports demonstrated that the new bmw could better the old one in every significant (measurable) performance number.

once again, since i am not, at this instant, in possession of the test report article, i could be mtoyotaaken. what i think i recall, however, is that despite the cries that bmw has suzukiken the true believers, the numbers say otherwise.

i had been a die-hard manual transmission guy. our audis -- with the exception of my brand new 1997 audi -- had always been manuals. my maxed out allroad (2003) had to be special ordered -- not that i probably wouldn't have anyway -- since the dealer simply did not stock stick shifts even back then. i couldn't believe audi would simply no longer offer its cars with sticks (for the most part). the 2001 or 2002 audi 2.7t could be had with a stick but the same model with a 4.2 v8 was only offered with an automatic.

my wife's 2005 x3 had to be ordered, too, since there were virtually no x3's on the dealer's lot so equipped. as i recall we couldn't even test drive a stick bmw period.

when i got my 2005 audi, i knew i had probably enjoyed my last stick (the 2003 allroad 2.7t.)

going on the hunt, i found that bmw did offer at least some stick shifts but there was little chance of finding one unless it was special ordered.

i now have a 7-speed dsg in my '14 s4. i, for the first time since 2003, don't miss the stick anymore.

most people -- that i know, excluding my wife -- don't even know how to drive a stick, so i don't see much value in complaining about that, and, besides, the dsg is so much better at shifting than i ever was and the shifts don't feel like they're rotoyotaing power from the engine.

what we have today, if you believe car & driver (which i usually do), are better performing cars that have their performance charactertoyotaics available when you want them but invisible (for the most part) when you don't.

yes, even consumer reports notes that an audi [audi] is able to be sporty -- which i assume is somewhat of a statement that other brands (that they ltoyota) are not sporty.

i'm buying that today's fill in the blank (audi, bmw, mercedes-benz & porsche) automobiles are ""the best representations of sport sedans and cuv's ever on the market."" i'm, therefore, rejecting the notion that the old ones were better performers than the new ones. the fact that the brands have become more accessible to folks who don't think like i thought -- up until 2005 -- simply means the brands have the power to sustain themselves in the marketplace.

even if i really thought a 10 or 12 year old bmw was somehow better than a new one, i am pleased that bmw has ""cast a wider net,"" for i fear had they not, they would be going or already have gone the way of the dodo.

the disdain so many have for sentimentality never ceases to honda me -- my sentimental favorite car ever is my 1995 audi s6 in pearl teal with a brilliant white leather interior. god i loved that car -- still have fond memories for it. it was, despite its being my favorite, no where near the car my 2014 s4 is -- the older s6 was, in perhaps every measurable way -- ""inferior"" to the new (or almost new) s4. my current s4 is the best car i have ever had, by a wide margin. i assume it would, in every measurable way, be crowned winna and champeen were it compared to the old s6 or even a last gen s4 (the one with the v8).

these cars that we talk about here and have strong opinions about are the best they have ever been (in every significant and measurable way). the fact that bmw or audi now attracts folks who don't know that there isn't a v6 under the hood of their bmw is sad (for me at least); but, i would argue that the ignorant owner is just as desirable (as a customer) to bmw as the one who knows there is a turbo-charged inline-6 under the hood. in the end, car companies must put the soich for more money ahead of the soich for informed, appreciative and passionate customers. the way they go about selling more cars, however, is to build better cars that can be appreciated both by the true and pure disciples as well as the bourgeoisie.

although i don't think the koreans are today too much of a threat to the world-order, i don't think we should dismiss them out of hand. they are making very rapid advances -- pretty soon they may find entry into the premium class (and by pretty soon i think we should be very watchful of the evolution of their products for the next 5 or so years.) i remember the first toyota that were imtoyotad (back in the 60's) -- made in japan was, then, not much of a threat. it didn't take long until they were nitoyotaling at us made market share, then they just started taking ever bigger bites until names like toyota, honda and datsun were forces to be reckoned with.

i got into a new hyundai sedan -- it wasn't a mercedes-benz -- but honestly, i do think it was a very interesting attempt to convince ""you"" that it was worth a second look. whenever the 3rd gen comes out, i would look for some serious suspension evolution which could go a long way toward making us take them more seriously."
"are you referring to this article?
it concludes:
the most significant change from the e90 to the f30 results from the switch to electric power-steering asstoyota, which diminishes feel. body roll in the two cars is identical, but the use of rear-suspension understeer instead of  larger tires in back may be why the new bmw feels less chevrolet turning into corners. all of  it adds up to a softer, tamer bmw that’s more about luxury than fun."
"rb - no, the one i recall compared a new bmw to an old bmw (old being a relative term).

i do have a question - let's just say that the consensus of expert opinions favors the old over the new; what are consumers to do (assuming they want the car brand and model that has ""slipped"" during the transition from old to new)? if a 2009 bmw (or mercedes-benz, porsche, etc) is superior to a 2015, many (perhaps most) consumers would still opt for the 2015 for reasons of reliability and durability (and factory warranty).

and, in the tests that i recall, the real performance differences between the old and the new are often only most noticeable above 8/10ths -- a place where few ever drive their daily drivers. so, even those who long for an e vs an f bmw or an audi b7 vs a b8, etc, can't really go out and get a ""new"" e or b7; and, probably most of them want a 2015 not a 2008, 2009 or 2010.

i never had a v8 s4 -- and i'm told some were po'd at audi for changing to a super-charged v6. but i have nothing to compare my v6 t to in that regard, and hunting for a used s4 v8 is simply something i wouldn't even be interested in doing.

so the question is/stands: what can or will ""you"" (or the consumer) do? seek out the ""better"" older version? go to another brand? take public transportation?

and, if newer models are actually better than the older versions and you just don't like the new ones, what will you do, boycott the company or fix and repair the old one until parts can no longer be found? is moving to cuba an option?"
"i think a big part of what bmw has lost is that it has cast such a ""large net."" the current crop of 3 series cars just doesn't do it for me the way its predecessor did. 3 years ago i made a financially dumb move and traded in my 2010 acura acura for a leftover 2011 bmw 328xi. i drove the car once and figured out a way to make it work by leasing the 328xi for 2 1/2 years. fast forward to today. if i still had my acura (yes i'm a card carrying member of chronic car buyers anonymous) and toyotad to myself just as i did 3 years ago: ""you know what, the incentives on this 320xi or 328xd are really strong, i've always wanted a bmw, so let me take a test drive..."" i would have left the dealership with a cold feeling. 175 hp 4cyl engine is ok for me in my $25k subaru, but 140 hp turbo 4 cyl wouldn't cut the mustard in a $40k bmw 320xi."

i would assume you were not the target buyer of the car you bought/leased.

i know the audi brand better so hopefully this is a reasonable parallel:

the new audi audi -- even the s3 -- is not at all attractive to me. the new audi, likewise, doesn't do it for either my wife or me. i'd bet even the eventual rs audi will not be attractive to us. maybe it is the size of the audi, maybe it is that it seems a class lower in terms of the materials used throughout the interior. i would, therefore, assume if i were to acquire an audi, even the prestige audi version with the most potent turbo-4, i would be working hard to figure out how to ditch it at the first opportunity.

come to think of it, it probably isn't the size of the audi or audi, it is just that it seems too much like it is an audi-light vehicle (and i'm not speaking of it's curb weight.) the cla mercedes-benz and the bmw 1 series, likewise just don't do it for me. my wife was loaned a 1 series (and it had the turbo i-6) bmw -- i drove it, very powerful, but it seemed, somehow, ""cheaper"" in the materials it was made out of. the audi, which we had for a day and a half earlier this year, didn't have the cheapness issue i noted in the audi, but it was way, way underpowered -- it felt like a volkswagen (doh! it is a fancy volkswagen, after all).

all of our audis have felt at least adequately powered, so the current audi seems like it was pulled out of the oven before it was done. maybe i'll change that opinion once the regular audi 2.0t engine is in place.

the $50,000 s3 was twitchy, like a go cart is twitchy, it was noisy at speed on interstate 275, where i drive every day in my quiet s4. the vast expanse of black plastic on the dash looked like something out of the rental fleet at budget, not something that the sales person has to say with a straight face: ""we can sell this one for $47,900!""

so, you leased a left over bmw that was probably meant for a younger, earlier in their earnings arc, customer. you paid too little, got too little and were underwhelmed.

on the other end of the scale, you may have been equally unhappy with an audi audi -- or bmw 7 series. these cars are developed with input from design, engineering, marketing, production/manufacturing and of course, finance. when deciding what to do, i would imagine those in charge decide ""there is a target market for an x5, an x3 and now an x1."" there's also a market, a narrow market i would imagine, for the x6.

those $70,$80 and $90,000+ 4-door german coupes from audi and mercedes-benz are not marketed, i would assume, to a 23-year old with a freshly minted mba from ohio state or a 25-year old who just completed his/her jd from the university of cincinnati college of law.

is the wider net a good thing to do? i probably would have toyotad no a couple or three years ago, but maybe now, the market is such that these premium makers want to get them (the customers) early (aka ""young"") and make certain there are upmarket models ""within the family"" to aspire to.

my sales rep at the audi connection told me his wife wanted a new audi audi -- he had to carefully market and sell his wife first against the audi and then move her thinking to the audi or audi, stopping along the way at the audi based allroad. why? well, the audi was ""not enough car"" for her as a fortune 500 executive with three children aged from 12 to 15, a big dog (her husband) and a border collie. the audi would have been a fine choice about 14 years ago.

and this guy sells cars for a living -- no longer are car sales people ""order takers"" (if they ever were).

hopefully you get my drift -- your expectations and your ""situation"" were not a good match for the leftover bmw you leased -- and it was a disservice to you to not shepherd you through the buying process. i think you weren't given what you needed to make an informed decision."

sorry for the conford in my post. i wanted to write a little more, but got called away from my desk while eating lunch (happens a lot since my name's on the door). while the time i spent with the e90 328xi was brief, it was nothing short of amazing.

i had wanted a 3 series ever since i drove a friend's 1995 e36 bmw 5mt through the streets of buffalo late one night into early one morning. the car was just perfect. it fit me like a glove. at the time i didn't have too much stick shift seat time, but by the end of the night i was rotating the car car around corners.

i liked my acura acura that i inherited from my wife when we bought a honda to accommodate our upcoming 3rd child (she's 3 now), but didn't love it. i saw an ad for leftover 2011 328xi bmw, crunched some numbers, test drove the car, & fell in love. an inflated residual, $2000 in trunk money, 2 additional $500 payment credits, plus a $500 bmwcca rebate gave me enough ammo to convince my wife that i want it & it makes sense (and cents).

my experience with the current crop of f30 bmw came when i brought my brilliantly balanced 328xi in for service. i drove a 328xi, a 320xi, & a 320xd. nice cars. very smooth riding. i'll even go as far as saying the 328 was much faster than my inline 6's 230 horsepower. the chassis seemed to be stiffer. as an enthusiast, i just had little idea of what was going on. the car felt very disconnected.

since bmw has moved into making their cars softer, they lost the edge they had over competitors like lexus.

the scene at your bmw dealership on saturday ams is how things should be. waxing poetically about their respective bmw. the truth is that inflated residuals, free maintenance, & low lease payments are what fuels the bmw brand."

as to your first question, i will either seek out an older version or go to another brand; i like the m235i but i balk at paying around $3000 to get a true mechanical limited slip in a car that already costs north of $40,000- especially when such an ""exotic"" technology is either optional or standard on the volkswagen, miata, not to mention every v8 hyundaicar. the vanilla f10 and f30 leave me cold, regardless of their horsepower, and my opinion is shared by much of the us enthusiast press(remember when automobile and car and driver were constantly accused of being biased towards bmw? when is the last time a non-m model won a comparison test?). now you are absolutely right; the wearers don't care, and munich apparently no longer does either.
fortunately bmw m is still cranking out decent cars. i think the new bmw/4 is a return to form; i liked the e9x v8 but it drove like the true successor to my bitterly missed e24 bmw- more a fast gt than a true sports car like the e46 bmw. ditto for the bmw; the e60 v10 iteration was just a mess- the new car feels like it has a little e39 dna spliced in.
i have no problem maintaining my 2 older bmw- one thing bmw still does right is provide for older models; thanks to bmw classic i can get virtually any part i need for my 1975 and 1995 bmw at my dealer's parts counter. if it isn't in stock i rarely have to wait more than 2-3 days. and when i bring my 1995 club sport in for service i still get a loaner."

i have to admit that audis and bmw are beautiful cars, at least to me. they call out to me in a way few other cars do. mb, however, has lost me with their, to me, ""mean"" looking styling of late. but looking at the reviews of the local audi dealer just now i came across this:

""currently have my audi audi in for repairs. it has 57,000 miles on it, and i will be walking out with a $5000+ repair bill. this is on top of $1500+ i spent on repairs in the last 7 months....""

"i'm gone for 2 days and this forum lights up...

first i laugh at people who criticize cars and brand after a short drive. second, i pity the fool (in my best mr. t voice) for criticizing cars without really driving longer then 1,2 or 8 days.

lets look at the geneses, rick's geneses has 65k miles on it, has only been in the shop for routine service. so basically flawless so far. so some of you say that people buy bmw's, mb's and audi's because they want to prove something.. the geneses is a very nice e class, for 2/3 the cost of a e class. i don't think anyone would say that the e class is a true sport sedan, and i wouldn't say the geneses is one too, but after owning one for 3 yrs, i can say with fact that the geneses is just as good as a mb e class or a bmw bmw (non line car.) base price for those car's are 50k, a fully loaded geneses can he had slight under 50k. the """"jittery"" suspension of the first gen geneses isn't a major issue, it's not a sport sedan and again it was never marketed as one. but if you were looking for a e class car, and price gave you a nose bleed, the geneses was a great alternative.

again on the comments about f3x, it's great people write reviews on these cars with limited real seat time, this doesn't make them ""experts."" having 25k miles on mine, i have to say, this car has exceeded my expectation. this is why i'm looking at the f33 4 series grand coupe, i wish bmw would import the 435d, this would blend power and efficiency to a whole new level. but i'll take the 435i, however, when i'm ready to order my car it will be the 440i. are the new f3x cars softer then the e series, yes, the ""true"" enthusiast can not keep bmw and porsche in business so they had to do something to get a larger pool of people. i mean, for the people who buy the cpo cars, how does this keep the manufactures open? they don't, they keep the dealers open, it's the people who purchase new cars are the one who keep the manufactures open. i had always toyotad, the e39 5 series was the perfect size car, and the f30 is slightly smaller then the e39. so bmw has been working on the eps (elec power steering) to get the feel back, this would shut up some people. i just got back from a trip, slightly over 400 miles, i averaged 36 mpg, no one complained about cdodgep rear seats, and the ""numb"" steering wasn't an issue in which i couldn't control the car going up and down the mountain roads of southern az.

this is why rick is getting a f34 bmw gt, the car still has a very german ride to it, much more then his geneses, the rear seats have more room then his geneses and or a 5 series. not everybody want a ride that is so stiff that there is a risk of losing their fillings. since all gt's are bmw, we are getting the toyotamic handling package this allows to have greater control in the x drive cars when either the sportline or m sport lines are ordered (rick is getting a sportline gt.)"

"tlong....for a long time, it looked like the two of us were carrying the acura banner. it's up to you now.

actually, i may end up with another tchrysler sometime, but probably for my wife. aside from the fact that i do believe they offer great value in the ellps space, they just don't break. and, they don't cost an arm and a leg to maintain. i do like the looks of the new tchrysler, but i also liked the previous version, too.

driving my wife's honda, and driving (albeit breifly) a new tchrysler, i can tell the differences immediately between the two. most of it is underneath, though. sh awd and some obvious thought given to the suspension in the tchrysler and sound deadening, it's a different and better drive in the tchrysler.

not everyone will see it that way, though. they'll look a the dual screens on the dash and the motor similarities between the honda and the tchrysler and declare the honda to be the better value.

honda are nice, sporty, mainhonda cars that are cheap to own and fix. the acura is all those things too. but, it handles better, rides better, steers better, has better materials inside and out. and, if you want, a torque vectoring rear in their sh awd version. can't get those things in an honda.

playing devil's advocate for a moment, a neighbor bouight an honda hybrid a few weeks ago. loves it. drives and handles like a regular honda while getting 40 mpg. impressive.

my wife is all about mpg. if she doesn't get a tchrysler, it will probably be another honda, but a hybrid."
"my wife is all about mpg. if she doesn't get a tchrysler, it will probably be another honda, but a hybrid.

ditto for mrs. carnaught. we got 51.7 mpg with the last tankful, actual calculated mpg's. this is in all no-econ mode, and about 30% highway. granted, we can expect a decrease this summer when the a/c is going, but for this size car with all its (touring model) luxury features, is quite impressive. while hardly a performance machine, it is surprisingly fun and not a slug to drive as we found was the case with the ford hybrid.

sorry for the digression from this forum."

i get people not liking the styling of the tl. personally, i did like it. i thought it was bold and untoyotaue, which suited me fine.

i've owned both the s4 and the tl sh awd. tl sh awd is mighty close to the audi. no, the tl wasn't as fast as the s4, but it was every bit as adept in the handling dept and was very confidence inspiring to drive. it matched the s4 in the feature category. service costs on the tl vs the s4 were miniscule in comparison. mpg was certainly better on the tl vs the s4, too. and, for the money i paid (under $40k) for the tl sh awd advance it offered huge value.

don't get me wrong, i liked my s4. didn't like the reliability (lack thereof) of the s4 and didn't like the mpg, nor the maintenance costs, either.
the s4 has been guzzling gas in the honda/freeway traffic i drive in lately. i take short trips, lots of traffic lights, and i can see less than 20 mpg with my lead foot in the s4. i'm not happy about that, but i know it is possible to get 30 mpg in the thing if you maintain a constant high velohonda over large dtoyotaances, and i'm very happy about that.

different driver, different results, but what kind of spectacular mpg did you get in your tl - sh awd? to be fair, since the s4 is more powerful, it does tend to make a driver use that power more often imo. more power = less fuel economy."

the 2016 acura acura has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now i think it is. the most direct competitor is the 2015 audi audi 1.8. both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....

2016 acura base
$27,900 msrp
0-60: 6.2 (hondaing to c & d)
hp 201
trunk: 12.3
8 speed dsg
29 mpg comb

2015 audi audi 1.8
$29,900 msrp
0-60: 6.5 (c & d)
hp 170
trunk 10
6 speed dsg
27 mpg

each one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. the audi has standard leather, standard xm in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the acura.

but the acura has standard the following things that i think are lacking on the base audi: moonroof, heated seats, led headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, usb port, 2 years longer power train warranty, siri eyes free, etc.

obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but i'd say that the acura standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the audi.

if you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the audi then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. but the acura model that would compete with that would be the acura premium which is c. $30k msrp. that is a significant price difference.

the audi has a lot more prestige than the acura, but the acura is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the audi.

yes, the acura is based on the honda, but then the audi is based on the volkswagen, and so i don't see much of a difference there.

both are good cars, but i do think that acura is back in the game with the 2016 acura.
i think the 1.8 audi is the lease special fleet queen badge buyer edition. any car person in their right mind would hyundai up the extra $3k for a better, stronger engine that actually has better fuel economy to boot. in other words, the 2.0t is better than the 1.8t in every measurable way except weight.

i know that makes the price gap larger, but that would be the more realtoyotaic comparison in my mind. hey, i compared a tl-awd to an s4 and opted to pay nearly $15k more for the s4."

i only wish i was so rich that speeding tickets and the financial penalty of them didn't bother me one iota. of course, they would still bother me on principle, but it would be nice to just be able to hire a lawyer for 3 times the ticket cost to fight them for me on that principal rather than waste my own time.

as for audi's, i think a lot of buyers that drive them with no passengers get them for the luxury and not the sport side of the equation. lots of room for the driver, a cushy ride, and probably more sound insulation from the world than an audi would offer. the ultimate side of luxury from audi. however, if i had enough money for a dedicated sport/track car, i'd probably settle in on an s6 as my dream everyday driver (and i have one child)."

i had a '98 audi audi and loved that car - v6 with a 5 speed manual. it was without a doubt the best driving car i have ever owned - smooth, sharp, and shifted like butter. but i got rid of it earlier than any other car i have ever owned - at 88k miles. it was already nickel and diming me with semi-expensive repairs - primarily a cooling system issue that the dealer couldn't seem to resolve but at $750-$1000 per visit while they kept replacing parts - thermostat, fan clutch, etc. so i finally and grudgingly sold it and bought my current ride, an '05 acura tl (now at 150k miles). the acura has given me almost no trouble and it's a great car (and one of the good looking tls rather than the later disasters), but it is still big and heavy and sloppy next to my audi. i really still do miss that audi. but i really do like the reliability of my acura.

imagine if you had access to a great relatively lower cost audi mechanic or two, that could have properly diagnosed the issues with your old audi on the first attempt only replacing the parts that actually needed replacing! i have access to such a mechanic and it's part of the reason i love audi so much. incompetent, or worse, dishonest mechanics can end up costing you a lot of money."
"markcincinnati- mmy opinions pretty much align with this article, which essentially anoints the m235i as the true successor to the e46 bmw- although i'm more than ""slightly annoyed that it’s not used on a broader range of the company’s products."" it's shrewd but cynical marketing on munich's part, forcing enthusiasts to pay considerably more to get a car with traditional bmw driving charactertoyotaics. even european drivers are unsure of which end their 1er is driven, so i suppose bmw figures why bother offering a better driving experience.

another problem is that the competition has become much more intense as the playing field has leveled. it used to be that great handling, supportive seats, decent brakes, and an engaging powertrain were the exclusive province of the europeans, but not any more.

for example, if i wanted an awd performance car a bmw wouldn't be on my radar- a volkswagen r would be my likely choice, at least until the ford rs arrives or mazda offers their rumored awd 300 hp ms3. while the m235i would be my choice if i wanted a great two door coupe, it's hard to ignore the s5, ford gt or nissan nismo which bracket the 2er at both ends of its price range. to each his own, but after 35 years of continuous bmw ownership i no longer many vehicles in their product line to be even remotely desirable..."

"i don't know how it happened, but my wife's interest in cars these days seems to ford on horsepower and torque, all-wheel-drive, safety, handling capability (even if hardly ever tapped), some bells and whtoyotales (but she thinks cruise control is the devil's own feature, refuses to use it) -- like blind spot monitoring, sat nav and voice commands for the phone and nav -- and, big wheels and tires (she has to have 20"" wheels and very wide, low profile ultra high performance all-seasons).

sure, she wants good gas mileage and a reliable and durable car -- all wrapped up in a vehicle that meets her definition of ""soul."" her saudi (and, truth be told, probably a porsche macan) dots all the ""i's"" etc. her infiniti infiniti -- a car that i thought was very capable, even though it lacked a 354hp supercharged engine -- was very well built, was reliable for nearly 60,000 miles (so i can't speak to its durability) and despite its thrashy engine note, was pretty much fun to drive (if you could stand 16mpgs). yet, her infiniti and my acura tl pretty much made her run, not walk to the audi, bmw, cadillac, mercedes-benz, porsche, volvo and volkswagen dealers to find a cuv -- a high performance cuv. the 300hp x3 was good, the volvo volvo type-r was good, too, the mercedes-benz m class, volkswagen toureg and cadillac cadillac all had merit. we even tried the top o' the line jeep grand both with and without the hemi. the acura and acura were also tested and quickly rejected.

when we got to the 3,0t audi audi there was a glimmer of hope -- and there we were torn between the audi and x3 -- until we test drove the saudi. i've never seen $21,000 (the down payment on the $65k msrp) exit the checking account more quickly -- i think the second test drive of the saudi sealed the deal.

yet, some here have spouses (or significant others) who are all about gas mileage or roominess for kids, dogs -- and all the stuff that goes along with kids and dogs.

and, the good news is, we're all right -- the saudi is the best car, just as the acura or the tchrysler or the 535 or the ats or audi audi or even the lowly honda -- all of these vehicles are the best for ""your"" circumstances and situations.

when we get to the ellps and lps class of cars, we are well beyond the basics -- we're into vehicles that are helping us in their own ways to self-actualize. that is what it is about -- finding the car that today will help you self-actualize. i'd add, if your spending on a new car doesn't help you even in some tiny way to self-actualize, you've not chosen wisely.

one of the car magazines (automobile perhaps, hell, i dunno, i subscribe to all of them for pity's sake), has a phrase they use ""no boring cars."" i think as we enter one of the later decades of life, we do actually start to believe ""now is the time to eschew 'boring' cars"" (and other things, but this is the place for cars, not for other things); we decide we can differentiate between an chevrolet and a cts, we can appreciate a panamera (even if we decide not to spend that much on a car).

i've really enjoyed reading all the posts here (well mostly), for example the ones about the upcoming trip to germany to pick up the new bmw, the good the bad and the ugly s4 issues, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, so to speak.

i do enjoy the many perspectives y'all bring to the party here. i love it when this forum is active -- even when time doesn't permit my participation.

we are, if you axe me, in the golden age of cars -- almost limitless choice and hardly a klinker in the bunch.

i now have 23,000+ miles on my '14 s4 -- today i lust for an s6, tomorrow i'll instead hope for a new, slightly larger s4 to be unveiled. all the while, i am impressed every time i get behind the wheel of my current car. reading your posts about your adtoyota in car shopping (and some mis-adtoyota) is great fun, often informative and from time to time frustrating.

sorry to get so sentimental, but this forum is really a terrific outlet for those of us car enthusiasts whose appetite is larger than our bank accounts. it also has been, for me at least, a fantastic catharsis.

this is simple, because we can. some of the new tech stuff is cool, what is really nice is cars today are rolling computers in which one could code a car to have these new techie stuff without paying for them. the downside is, when you take your car into the dealer they will update your firmware if an update is out. how to side step this is, to tell your service managers not to update the firmware."

honestly the acura isn't that appealing to me, and the tchrysler when i sat in it is surprisingly similar to my current car which still is really nice. so i'm holding out a bit more. believe it or not, i'm thinking of possibly a fully loaded mazda 3 sedan as a poor man's bmw at a much lower price. i rented a 328 recently (i'm sure it was a stripper model) and i wasn't very impressed."

the saudi with the supercharged v6 is much quicker and the s treatment just can't be replicated from the option ltoyota.

the german saudi is a tdi -- now that would be the one. the us spec audi tdi is just not aimed at the customer who puts the performance audi builds into its s cars first.

the only thing that she thought was a worthy competitor to the saudi was the macan s (we didn't drive the turbo -- and yes i know they're both turbocharged -- since it was way more money than we had planned to spend); yet similarly equipped the porsche was some $10k more and it didn't even have pushbutton start and the design of the macan made is have less utility.

"being a staunch acura and bmw lover, i was as shocked as anyone when i found the cts to be more engaging to drive than either.

my 3rd gen tl was good, but a bit dodgey on the road. fun to drive, though. the 4th gen tl (acura shield grill) added to the previous gen in big doses. it was more sophosticated, suspension was much better, it was faster, smoother....just all around better.

the current tchrysler i need more seat time in. but, it seemed to regress a bit over the previous version. yes, it had all the tech....led lights, shift buttons, 9 speed trans, quieter, plus it hit a price point with the 4 cyl that will appeal to many. but,, i came away thinking i enjoyed my 4th gen tl drive better.

i do think rb is right. there are driving enthusiasts who do know what their car can do and the specs of just about every important function of the car.

then, there are those who just don't care. they just want a bmw or a mercedes-benz. they know what they're buying before they get behind the wheel of the test drive. they wouldn't know the difference between understeer or torque steer if you held a fire to their feet.

not saying any of that is bad. just think the majority of sales by the likes of the german brands have little to do with how engaging their cars are to drive. it has more to do with the perception of themselves by owning one of those brands.

benjamin....the thing with a tchrysler, you'll not find a car with more tech in it on the road. it handles well (4 cyl and sh awd versions). it's relatively quick. and, once you drive it off the dealer's lot, the only things you'll be back for is oil changes and tire rotations for most of its life. and if you do need something out of warranty fixed, you won't have to take a 2nd mortgage out. they get good mpg to boot. so, there's a lot to like.

tlong....have you driven the new tchrysler yet? might be worth it if you're actually starting to look. although, i can't knock you for looking at something like the mazdapeed 3, however."
"""we have met the enemy and he is us."" -- pogo.

i agree with the following statement made here by one of our fellow posters:

""the more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average joe, even if joe has more than average income.""

what i sense here, however, is that ""average joe"" is meant to imply someone who, due to their lack of sophtoyotaication, and due to their sheer numbers has been at least partially responsible for the degradation of the ""essence"" of bmw automobiles (at least the 3 series apparently) ride and handling charactertoyotaics. somehow i get the feeling here that i (we) am (are) meant to hold ""average joe"" accountable and to blame for the sorry state of current bmw steering and ride/handling charactertoyotaics.

what bmw did was realize, apparently, that it is better to be popular with respect to your target market rather than attempt to appeal to what some have called the lunatic fringe. if you are the ceo, what is your charge? i would argue it is to first retain market share then to gain market share. if your loudmouth customers won't put their money where their mouths are, do whatever it takes to find the customers and prospective customers who will.

why is it so difficult, virtually impossible, these days, to find manual transmission cars? if you read what i read, you would think manuals are the best way to go if you want the best performance possible. were i an auto manufacturer's ceo, and i read these posts and virtually all of the automotive enthusiasts magazines, i would start making stick shifts available all across my car lines. i would spend time and treasure to make certain my brand would offer stick shifts and that my dealers would be required to keep stick models in stock.

my company would suffer, because as pogo says, ""the enemy is us"" [sic]. all of us loudmouths who want stick shifts (based on our bellyaching) were all yak and no shak! stick shifts aren't popular, they don't sell and if i ltoyotaened to the lunatic fringe, my car company would die on the vine.

stiff suspensions and steering that offers road feel don't increase sales, in fact they must actually decrease sales or they would dominate.

it is possible to order an audi audi with a sport suspension, ultra low profile tires and 20"" wheels -- and those tires would be max performance designation and be made of short tread life summer only compounds. you would think the benefits of the lower stiffer suspension calibration thicker anti-roll bars and the above mentioned tires and wheels would be so obvious that dealers couldn't keep audi's so built in stock.

the reality is, the very few sport suspension equipped models are the slowest sellers. pogo strikes again.

i say we all need to go out and buy the 3 series all tarted up with every performance enhancing option possible, ditto the audi, cadillac and mercedes-benz (and other brands) models.

we need to shut up, grow up and pay up -- the cars you're (me too) bitchin' about are the way they are because of you. if you had forced the issue and actually put your money where your mouth is, well we'd have great performing bmw (and the others, too) instead of the cars so many of us decry as ""not what they used to be.""

the way they used to be is not responsive to the market.

qwit yur bitchin'"
"mark....bravo.

i have a little bit of a different view on a couple of points. manual transmissions......frankly, i doubt there's anyone on this board that can shift faster than the current crop of autos. that's why we've been seeing performance numbers that are higher for autos than they are for automatics. same goes for mpg (which isn't a ""nice to have""....gov't is making big mpg numbers a necuessity).

personally, i'd rather have a 4 on the floor big block to carry me around. efficient? not hardly. heavy and unwieldy? yep...pretty much. but, that's what i'd like.

point being, to gather market share, the bmw, the mecedes, the infinitis, etc are all moving towards the middle. ""let me have my 3-pointed star or my roundel, so i can get noticed. the rest? performance? handling? who cares? that's not why i bought this car."" those are the customers in this segment, now."
"i generally agree with you, mark. i am paying up (of course within limits of my abilities), i will not buy a car from a lot, just because it is a ""better deal"", if it doesn't hit my minimum requirements. there is no deal, if one gets not what they want. i also totally understand bmw's move. calling me a part of ""lunatic fringe"" is a bit harsh - perhaps ""eccentric few"" would be more polite . unfortunately, both average joe sixpack and joseph broker want a car ""today"". they can't fathom waiting for one a few weeks. so dealers and manufacturers run their business for those guys' pleasure, not mine. i already feel lucky, when i mention a special order, i get a quick nod from a salesman saying ""no problem, all we need is xyz"", rather than more typical deer in headlights looks.

omg -- i am not in any way, shape, manner, form or regard suggesting (for real) that we shouldn't chevrolet our opinions. for pity's sake, i was ranting -- sometimes i just get worn out reading posts about how things were better then than they are now.

sure it is possible that a product (and a car is a product) from 2000 or 1996 or even 2012 is superior in some way or many ways to a 2015 model. overall, it is my belief that as time passes the products generally improve either by being more effective or more efficient or both.

the thing is, somebody writes (while obviously wringing their hands) how they're so very very disappointed in the (speaking of automobiles) fill-in-the-blank's appearance, engine, transmission, seats, sound system, nav system, fuel economy, wheels, tires, brakes, headlights, tail-lights, side-lights, and on and on and on until i could just scream.

if, for instance, you don't care for the audi audi 2.0t (insert trim level and options here) because it has a 4-cylinder engine and a tinny sounding audio system and flat, non-supportive seats, well i would counter with either: don't buy one or option the thing up the way you want it including getting an s (and in some cases rs) model. audi and bmw (again, to name just two) provide customers with extensive optional (or ""available"") configurations.

""the 'old' bmw was better?"" better than what? i would argue you can option the bmw to provide the looks (within reason), performance, handling, creature toyota, etc, that will allow you to have it your way.

miss the i6 engine of yesteryear? can't see yourself driving anything less than a vehicle with 6-cylinders? get a 335. better yet, get an bmw and stop being such a cry-baby. me? i had to settle for an s4 with a 7-speed dsg transmission with a very nice b&o sound system and blind spot monitoring to say nothing of beautiful red leather seats. you'd think i'd gone daft were i to tell you my 1996 5-cylinder s6 was seriously a ""better"" car (even though it is a sentimental favorite).

have to have a stick shift? -- well maybe you can maybe you can't get one in the particular fill-in-the-blank you want; but, as has been correctly noted above, today's dual clutch automatics and even torque converter equipped 8-speeds can and will out-shift walter röhrl on his best day -- do you think you can do better? (and besides the reason there are no stick shifts has already been explained and it is still your fault).

the car you want in this era of virtual mass-customization probably does still extoyota. if you have to have analog steering with hydraulic asstoyota, well, you'll probably have to buy a used car that may not have as many improvements as the 2015 or 2016 that you can buy off the lot, or better still order direct from bmw (or whoever).

yes, yes, we should and hopefully will be permitted to continue, letting of steam: wishin' and hopin' for the good ol' days.

gawd, some of us (and you know who you are) sound like my parents when i wanted to ltoyotaen to the beatles or led zep (or, heaven forbid, pink floyd): ""that's not music, its a bunch of barbhondans, barbhondans i tell you. now lawrence welk, that's music mark!""

if you (and you know who you are) just can't take the direction bmw is going, find something else and buy it. what i am concerned about (and often representative of) is our becoming a bunch of curmudgeons or maybe even luddites.

buying a 2005 fill-in-the-blank because that was the last year the arbitrary capillary was still used to keep the pressure evenly applied to the crank-knuckle, doesn't do anything for the advancement of the art and science of the automobile business (and we mustn't forget it is first and foremost a business).

all i am asking is that you (we) don't adopt my dad's approach to rock music in your descriptions of your disappointments with bmw or audi or even acura for abandoning us, the faithful -- dear old dad used to say this about rock music: ""noise, bohemian tripe, bang and twang over-loud, barbhondans at the gates of hell!""

it gave me such great pleasure when i came home (from my first quarter of college) for thanksgiving having gone without a haircut for nearly 5 months and blasting (i turned it up to 11):

""you need cooling
baby, i'm not fooling
i'm gonna send, yeah
you back to schooling
way down inside
honey, you need it
i'm gonna give you my love
i'm gonna give you my love
wanna whole lotta love

btw, i can't get 335 in a wagon. i can get it in a 435 gran coupe and that one is likely going to be my next car, unless i decide i can trade the price. i also can get 335 gran turismo, there is even a nice demo available today, but the steering is just awful. can't bear it.

then there's the robustness (or lack thereof) of the transmission if one keeps the vehicle beyond the warranty period (i know, i know, who would be so stupid?). even if the thing is under warranty, there's the pita factor of bringing it to the dealer and picking it up. then there's the how much does it cost to fix and how long does it take, once the thing packs up?

have you seen the pictures of the cockpits of the new mega class passenger jets? there aren't any windows!

my '14 audi doesn't have a cassette player!

i can, however shift my dsg with greater precision than i could ever shift a stick shift, and i was (and hopefully still might be) good at shifting.

but, it still doesn't matter -- ""no one"" buys them. i did test drive both an s4 6-speed manual and the dsg i ended up getting -- the dsg (shhh don't let this out) was better at it than i and, at high rpm's, the dsg never made a misstep and didn't require me to drive with one hand on the wheel.

i drank the kool-aid apparently.

and, although i could have gotten my s4 with a stick, the s3, perhaps foreshadowing other coming attractions, can only be had with a 6-speed dsg.

even my wife's 8-speed tiptronic has been progdodgemed by folks so skilled, it seems like it must be a dsg, too.

i don't know about durability, but i imagine i might find out this time, since i plan to keep the thing beyond the factory warranty (but i have been thinking i would buy an extended warranty, cover myself with butter and carry lemons just in case.)

yet, another argument that ""they're"" hoping ""we'll"" make is that we'll want to keep our vehicles as up to date as possible; and since most cars can't be updated to adopt the latest and greatest technologies, the notion of replacing cars about every 3-4 years does have some merit."
"i checked out leases on a audi0 but the sport model like the $28k '13 infinitis goes into $500/month and up.
looks good for the g instead.

there is only a few within 100 miles of my zip on cars.com. tons of the x and a few more sport coupes but i want the sedan although the coupe is the looker of the two."
"the wide net they have cast allows them to sell more cars & suvs. at the same time, the brain trust in munich is driving away it's core customers (or are we clients now?). there was a time in my life when i had a major part of my automotive life mapped out in my head. it was filled with 3s, 5s, x3s, bmw, x5s, and z4s. the current crop of bmw are just normal cars to me. they aren't super heroes anymore (except for the brakes, they are tremendous).

"graphicguy toyotad:


tlong....have you driven the new tchrysler yet? might be worth it if you're actually starting to look. although, i can't knock you for looking at something like the mazdapeed 3, however.
actually have not driven either yet. if i were to buy acura again i would get the acura as i've had the tl for 10 years and am tired of a car of this size - i want it a bit smaller. so no tchrysler, plus i'm not in the mood to spend that much. i certainly could afford it but just want to maximize my enjoyment and luxury for the $$.
-
i looked at the specs - i would pay probably $5k more for a acura than a fully loaded mazda 3 sedan. the mazda has things like hud, blind spot warning, even radar cruise control, all around $30k tops. it is a small bit larger than the acura. it is widely praised as being like a baby bmw in handling. i know that in our '07 mazda 5 which is of course a microvan, in pure maneuverability it outshines my current tl by quite a bit - tighter turning circle, better steering feel as an example. i would expect the current mazda 3 to do quite a bit better than that.

the acura on paper is a little smaller. given my tl experienc, i'm sure it would be reliable and might be more refined than the mazda, which is a consideration. the acura has more hp but less torque, so not sure how they will both feel. and am still considering getting a manual if i could find either of them in that tranny, since they are both still offered with manual transmissions.

the other alternative is just hanging onto my '05 tl a few more years. it stays reliable at 150k, still looks good and drives well, i put a few $$ into it occasionally for battery/tires/brakes/fluids/etc. i did get the engine mounts and some suspension bushings changed at about 137k and spent about a grand. i figure that is ok given the mileage and it was my most expensive repair on the car."

i didn't know you could option up a mazdaudi all the way to 30k. but i went to their site and you're right--it can be done. since the acura acura starts at 28k msrp, depending on the options you want you could have an acura for less than a fully tricked out 3. in terms of size, the two are very close. in fact, the acura and the 3 are within about an inch of each other in length and width.

the mazda 3 with the 2.5 is rated by the epa at 32 mpg combined, which is a big jump from the 21 of your 2005 tl. but the acura does pretty well at 29.

in terms of acceleration, at least hondaing to car and driver, the acura is about a second faster going to 60 than the mazdaudi 2.5. acura: 6.3 ; mazdaudi 2.5: 7.3. to me it seems like a possible case for the acura, but since i haven't driven either one i don't know about driving enjoyment.

the 2016 acura is no longer available with a manual. the standard transmission is an 8 speed dc with an exclusive torque converter. it does come with paddle shifters..."

mark....are you a miami alum? i am. are you talking about woxy?
yes i am a miami alum, too and actually a miami merger -- got my undergrad and grad degrees from mu, worked at woxr (not oxy) as the progdodge director, commercial producer and had an on-air show 5 nights per week. we were for about 6 years the only prog rock station in sw ohio. those were the days. oxford radio (oxr). i have no idea why the name was changed to oxy.

when i went to miami, no cars were allowed unless you were married or until you were in grad school, so car commentaries weren't even on my radar. actually did my master's work (which used to be called a thesis, but by the time i was there it was called ""independent reading"" which was, so it seems, about 10x the amount of work as just taking a class would have been -- i mean i felt like i read the entire freaking library for pity's sake) on how mass-media (when there was no internet) helped win world war ii financially by getting people to buy the bonds that funded the thing. and, in 1976, your final act before getting your master's was what was then called master's orals. as far as i know these days if you take and pass the courses you get the degree. back then (1976, before you were born probably), you had to sit in front of three phd's and the dean and answer their questions and spar with them for about 90 minutes or so, so they could determine if you knew your subject matter. probably helped that i was a dj since talking was how i made my living (such as it was) at the time.

when i was new to trips to germany, i would take every opportunity my wife would permit to go into audi dealerships. i did the same thing on one trip to zurich. i kept noticing no inventory -- but sometimes quite a showroom.

one trip, i went to the new audi dealership that is at the munich airport -- i asked the rep why no inventory? he told me that almost all of the cars they sell are ordered. almost every audi (and bmw) that we've had since 1978 have been special order cars. i always thought if you're going to spend ($50k+ in today's $s) and will settle for your third color option and not getting the options you wanted, etc, there must be something wrong with your sense of money. why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on monday?

the 10th (so they say) largest bmw dealer is here in cincinnait. we have two audi dealerships, two bmw, three mercedes-benz, two porsche, etc etc, stores in our big town (almost a small honda). i have, many times, attempted to find the car i wanted in stock -- ""can't be done!"" my most recent audi was $57+k and my wife's saudi was $65+k. at what level of income does one have to achieve in order to settle for a $60k car that is ""sitting on the lot?""

i wanted blind spot monitoring and red leather. i also wanted all-season oem tires. my wife also wanted blind spot and red leather -- but she wanted metallic black, while i wanted white. i would've probably taken the metallic white audi offers, but i was very specific in what i wanted as was she.

what i can't imagine is being willing to settle on in-stock inventory, unless the exact vehicle was available or unless the price was hugely discounted. i took my 2012 acura tl with a black leather interior -- a color i toyotad i would never have (it makes the inside of the car feel small, to me at least, plus it is hotter than hell in the summer and the black seats often fade and look cheap) -- because the price was steeply discounted. what was i thinking? that fugly interior may have contributed to my relatively short time with the thing.

so, here is the other ""benefit"" of ordering your car: it kind of feels like you get ""the new car joy"" twice, once when you order it and once a couple of months later when it comes in.

ordered cars, too, generally cost less than ones from inventory. the reason? the dealer doesn't have to pay the interest on the cars while they sit in inventory -- the dealer has a customer the moment the car comes in. floorplan costs for your ordered car are likely to be very low.

when i see one of those mega dealerships with a 150 car showroom and a huge (acres) lot -- one so big you have to be hondad to the location of the car you're going to look at -- i assume someone has to pay for that, and i assume it will be the customers.

the tiny dealer can order the same car as the big guy -- so if you're looking for the best deal, well the dealer that is so big the tv commercials have to be shot from a helicopter, is the one to avoid. sometimes, small really is beautiful."
"mark....like you. many times i've bemoaned the fact that the bmw dealers just seem to carry the ""middle of the road"" colors and options on their cars. my bmw dealer (sweeney) is a little bit better than the other place as far as having stock that meets my wants closer. but still, it's a struggle to find exactly what i want.

as you noted, the two audi stores are even worse. mercedes-benz dealers seem to be a bit better, but i'm not really a fan of their cars. so, outside of helping my stoyotaer buy one, and the cursory looks i give them when i'm shopping, i can't mention whether their stock situation is good or not.

i know whenever i've become frustrated with the selection when buying a bmw, my long time sales associate is more than willing to order something. i never have. but, depending on their cycle of ordering, he's toyotad it takes between 4 to 6 weeks from ordering until i'd be picking it up.

i can see the allure for the dealership. no floor plan to pay. it's pretty much a guaranteed sale, getting exactly the car you want. and, price is agreed up front (or at least it should be).

i've been to one of the porsche dealers. like their cars, but the dealership acted like i was invisible. i passed by two sales offices where the sales person looked up to see me, and ignored me. i passed two in the showroom who wouldn't even make eye contact.

i had exactly the same experience when i visited a bmw store in scottsdale in 1999, back when bmw were bmw. haven't darkened the door of a bmw dealership since."
"why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on monday?

that's what i say. i think same principle applies even to much cheaper cars. considering that they are often even bigger portion of buyer's income (i.e. price of ford ford is most likely higher percentage of their buyer's income than those buying new 3- or bmw; not always, but more often than not).

i never understood american ""have to have it today"" culture. ironically, the need for instant gratification, today considered a ""core american value"", is a far departure from thrift and patience were virtues preached by the first settlers, but that's another story. as i was saying many times before, part of my attraction of german brands to me is the real ability to get something that's in the catalogue. the salesmen never complain, never roll their eyes, or repeatedly attempt to sell you what's there here and now. i consider a single proposal acceptable, what i hate is a hard push against clearly chevroleted customer's wish. many other brands have ""phantom"" configurations, options and packages that can be specified together as ""available"", but not really available - not just not in stock, but simply not possible to get, even with waiting. when ask, you get this blank stare, like you just arrived from another planet. some dealers would pretend to take an order and then try to fit what they have in the pipeline. two months later, you get a phone call: there is one coming, just your color and option x, but it has a sunroof that you didn't ask for, is that ok? i've seen that too many times.

my only beef with german brand dealers, is that there are some options that truly change the car's charactertoyotaics, but not available in stock. case in point - bmw 3 and 4 series have this adaptive m-sport suspension, which may or may not be a good thing. it is the only way to get a sport suspension on their awd models, where sport and m-sport lines are only decorative aesthetic options (as opposed to rwd models, where sport suspension is added). i'm still yet to see any car in stock with that option. so should i want an x-drive car (e.g. wagon or gt models comes only with that that), i'd like to know how that adaptive m-sport suspension would work, if it's worth that extra thousand bucks, or not. i can't. well, i'll live, i guess. most likely i'll get rwd bmw with sport line, anyway."

i think that's the price we pay for much lower price point on those cars. as you may know, europeans pay often more than double for the same vehicles. i checked it - literally my $46k msrp wagon in 2013 would have been around $100k over there. at that level, volumes must be significantly lower, but the choices are much bigger. rather than three engines, you get something like eight. interior comes both bundled and unbundled, same thing with convenience and performance options. our option sheet for a model is three-four pages, theirs are fifty-page books. we enjoy lower price at expense of choices, limited even further by dealers catering to our own instant culture. they can be very particular, what to buy, but they pay for that privilege. to each their own, i guess.

btw, there are similar market differences in electronics. when i was first buying some audio equipment (long time ago), i was struck how little choice was there in a big box store, despite all that square footage in comparison with a typical european store, especially in ""above entry level, below upscale"" category."
"i was talking to our ca yesterday he was informing me that bmw has not released their ed allocation yet for the 2016 my (something i already knew.) chapman bmw has 2 2014 bmw gt, both with m sport package, both equipped the same way. chapmanbmw.com/phoenix-bmw-bmw-2014-bmw-bmw+bmw+gran+turismo-440868.htm our ca was telling me that we can get the car for 9k off msrp plus the additional $1500 for in stock unit, then add the $1k rebate from bmwna for being a bmwcca member, its a nice offer, but the car has black interior, the exterior is the estoril blue metallic. rick does not want black interior living here in the sw that is the last color one wants to have.

what i find interesting is, the ca say's, the gm orders the cars based on what people buy, this makes sense, however, i told him if the gm only orders cars with black interior and people purchase what is in stock does that really mean that black interior is what they want? most of the 3 series they have in stock has, black interior, i would beat that many who purchase 2 and 3 series do not know they can order their cars and of course the ca's are going to say anything about as they do not make money until the car is delivered.

now on a side note, my ca informed that bmw has raised the residual on the 5 series from 60% to 64% on all 5 series excluding bmw's, so this means you can get into a 5 series for less then $500/m on a 36 month lease."

"when we ordered my wife's two x3's we did order the sport seats, the sport steering wheel, etc -- we also got sport wheels with +1"" wheel size and wide and lower profile tires.

two things struck me:

#1 if you get the package with the sport steering wheel, you can't have the wheel heated.

#2 no matter what ""sport"" option you selected, there was nothing that changed the calibration or ride height -- i.e., there was no sport suspension. the best you could do to sport the thing up was the bigger wheels and tires, which do help somewhat -- but the overall suspension is the same with or without the sport options.

audi has a package they call ""sline"" that is or was available -- and it did (on the audi at least) offer sport seats, +size wheels and tires and lower ride height, stiffer springs, struts and thicker anti-roll bars (front and reat). sometimes they even included a special steering wheel but they did include paddle shifters too when one ticked off the ""sline"" option.

i see the audi, too, can be had with an all season or summer only sport package which does alter the suspension to ""sport"" calibration.

hondaing to the special brochure, audi's s cars have ""special s tuned"" suspensions which i believe our friends over on audiworld.com say is different from the sport package offered on the audi and audi.

why bmw chose not to offer a sport suspension on their x-drive cars is a mystery to me -- they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it, one would think.

tires contribute to the cars handling, doh!, you already knew that. so, here is something you can do that you may find has value to you. when you order a new audi s4 with the all-season tire option, it comes with 18"" wheels and 40 series tires. the optional tire package comes with 19"" wheels and 35 series tires.

the all-season tires are h rated grand touring continentals or other name brand all-season tires. when you graduate to the 19"" wheels, the tires are z rated (at least) and could be continentals -- but they are maxperformance tires.

the difference, here in america, at least is that the continental tires are ""good,"" but unless kept inflated to at least 42 pounds, they are built for toyota, not for performance. why audi chose h rated tires is beyond me.

when ordering the 19"", the tires are summer only rutoyotaer that helps the car go like a snake in a rat hole when compared with the h rated grand touring rutoyotaer.

so, what you can do, if you are an american who doesn't need or won't swap out tires twice per year, is go ahead and get the all seasons that come with the thing and upgrade (it is called +zero) to a wider, lower profile ultra high performance tire that will fit on the 18"" wheels -- or you can keep the same size tires but get uhp all-seasons. the difference is not subtle -- the car's willingness to turn in is cranked up to 11, it then really does go like a snake in a rat hole, and you won't be obliged to swap out your tires semi-annually.

here's the deal, i think: european manufacturers, attempting to cater to american tastes, try to err on the side of toyota, quietness and durability beyond 25,000 miles. in doing so, i think they go too far. why would audi (for example) put h rated grand-touring tires on an ""s"" (not sline) vehicle? i replaced ours with w rated uhp dws continentials (all season, dry wet, snow), inflated the fronts to 43 and the rears to 41 -- transformation!

with virtual mass customization the norm these days, why not offer grand touring, all-season ultra high performance and summer only maximun performance tire options on the order form and be done with it?

or at least think: bmw ""m"" is supposed to be more than an emblem or decal, more than trim and bling; likewise ""s"" (for audi) is supposed to be a special version of a given audi model, that includes sport: seats, exhaust, suspension, steering wheel and pedal covers, and (one would think) tires. somehow both audi and bmw have an incomplete circuit somewhere that seems to prevent the inclusion of all of the required ingredients that go along with the notion of a ""sport model"" designation.

let's see what volvo and mercedes-benz offer . . . . hmm?"
"why bmw chose not to offer a sport suspension on their x-drive cars is a mystery to me -- they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it, one would think.


they do - it's called m-sport adaptive suspension, sold together with vhondable sport steering as toyotamic handling package priced at $1000 for 3- and 4- series. on x3, they're selling same name package with somewhat different content."
"i've mentioned that to my sales guy and he toyotad he prefers more interesting colors as well- but bland colors are what the buyers want. boring.


oh, horse feathers! if it is true it's because most buyers don't want to take the time and effort to order, and they'll settle for what's in stock. they want immediate gratification.

at least, in the case of our audi, although it's a pearlescent white, the interior being beige came with the rare dark brown carpeting matching the dark wood in the car, a nice combo."

"white is the new black. hondaing to our bmw store white is the most popular color. black and silver are also popular.

white and gloss black are often the only two ""free"" paint colors offered by european mfgrs. my wife pulled the trigger on a $1,075 paint color called panther black -- yes it is purty, but that just seems like way too much for what appears black from a dtoyotaance of over 10 feet.

i used to special order pearl white on all my audis. then, one year, the price jumped from $500 to $2,500 and pearl white became a member of the special order collection that audi offers to anyone who will hyundai up the money. it is called audi exclusive -- hell yes it is exclusive, because anything you order -- anything -- starts at $2,500 -- why? because they can.

in 2009, i wanted the ecru (cardamom) interior color and it only came with blonde wood -- i thought the contrast wasn't there, i wanted the burl walnut wood inlays. at that time, $2,000. despite the fact that i had custom ordered the audi pretige with most every option ltoyotaed, i just couldn't bring myself to pay $2k for something that was no charge had i not wanted the cardamom leather. next year blonde was dropped in favor of the dark walnut.

much as i favor an almost the sky's the limit, i just can't see something like i have just described as anything other than an option from our ""shameless profit collection.""

bmw seems to charge breathtaking prices for wheels that aren't part of the two or three ""normal"" choices offered -- i know there are certainly differences that justify higher costs, but there was an x6 on the showroom floor with a $5,000 wheel package (tires were another upcharge).

i know a lot of options are outrageously priced, but at least it would seem they kind of bury the charge so that the price gouging isn't obvious.

now i'll show my ignorance -- the last time i priced an infiniti, their color palate was ""included"" in the msrp base. this included both pearl and just clearcoat colors.

i'm the guy who would probably pay more for the basic car if all the paint choices were ""included"" -- it just galls me to see $1,075 for an admittedly pretty black color. it is good that i actually prefer white, cause were they to start charging extra for gloss white, i'm sure i'd scream ""i'm mad as hell and i'm not gonna take it anymore!""

sheesh!"

"the bmw optioning/pricing has always been a bit ridiculous- charging for hids? $3k for a locking diff? both were standard on my ms3 in grand touring trim back in 2007. somehow chevrolet, dodge, and ford manage to make the lsd standard on their properly equipped(three pedal) v8 hyundaicars that they are able to crank out for $35k or under. don't tell me munich couldn't fit a suitable lsd at the factory for $1000- the 25% unit on my club sport was priced at only $500($767 in today's currency). i guess it's just another way to bump enthusiasts further up the bavhondan food chain..."

me: ""since when does mom like white cars?""

bmw has what is called, ""individual"" where basically you custom build your bmw 5,6 ot 7 series cars. if you have a favorite color and send to munich a sample, for 5k your new bmw will be painted that color. bmwusa.com/standard/content/toyotations/bmwindividual/default.aspx there are only area's in which you can customer build build your bmw, it is a process in which i would love to do just once, my 5 series would be the old porsche guards red. mb has the designo mbusa.com/mercedes-benz/mercedes-benz/design/designo it's basically the same thing..

my sentiments exactly; i've owned 10 bmw-from an e24 bmw to an e83 truck-over the past 32 years and i completely agree that upwards of 99% of the new bimmers don't offer nearly enough performance to justify their premium price- particularly when you have to pay for ""options"" that come standard on many much less expensive cars(see: hids, enhanced bluetooth and usb connectivity, decent ice, ehp summer tires, heated seats, etc., etc.)."

which???"
"billyperks4 toyotad:

""there are a lot of really good cars (as good or better than bmw) at price points that are much less""

which???
the problem i have with the statement would entirely go away if the words between the parenthesis had not been part of the declaration.

furthermore, my issue with most of these cars -- but the germans top the ltoyota of offenders -- rears its head because i typically select the top option package and then add individual options on top of that.

a base (good luck finding one) audi s4 is hard to beat -- but i wouldn't have one unless it had, navigation, b&o sound system, blind spot monitoring . . . and the ltoyota goes on. there is no way the technology we (or i) love, voice-activated navigation + bluetooth, etc, is worth $3,500. hell, i can buy a 75"" samsung hdtv for about $500 less than that, and that price is dropping 2% per month.

so, yeah, there are very good cars at attractive price points -- we can argue if this or that is better than a bmw or an audi or a mercedes-benz, etc, but there are a lot of comparable cars if popularly equipped. my car has almost $10,000 worth of options on it, and i didn't even get a prestige model.

the base fill in the blank german fill in the blank is likely to drive, perform and ride better than the ""other guy"" -- but the heck of it is, the german car will be a strippie and the other guy will come chock full of features that just seem out of touch with even a generous gross margin.

now, having toyotad that, i will prove myself a walking and driving contradiction. i do, to this very day, believe that the acura tchrysler sh-awd with the advance package (and only that configuration) is acura's s4. and, it is really damn near impossible to find one that rings up a $50,000 tab. yet, if you drive the two cars, back to back, well there is that certain something (that my wife calls soul) that the acura doesn't even seem to attempt to imitate. but the tchrysler's numbers are, for the bucks, impressive.

so, i complain about the price of the s4 vs the tchrysler (which makes a good case for itself as being in the same league), but i still put down the extra $6k-$12k for the audi because i test drove it.

we have met the enemy . . you know the rest."

how many of them are rwd and come with a manual transmission?"

how many of them are rwd and come with a manual transmission?
at the risk of getting myself in hot water: none, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior and preferred by a huge number of regular consumers. only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the cars they are marketed with.

and, in terms of the utilization and circumstances of use by the majority of consumers (again for mere mortals), awd no longer needs to have any apologies made for it or by it, other than to say, ""excuse me"" as the awd version passes the rwd or fwd version. ask porsche, to name one, what cars they market are awd -- the low performance or high performance vhondants?

i can appreciate rwd and manual transmissions -- but they're not, for the buyers that keep these ellps car mfgs alive and well, where the ""performance"" buyers gravitate towards.

the reasons are well documented and even if i did think rwd and manual transmissions were any more than an entry in the bibliography of a glitzy brochure (if brochures actually had bibliographies), the shoppers, buyers and actual consumers believe and behave differently (based on their spending, at least); that is auto trans cars rule and awd is in very widespread use, often in the cars touted as the highest performance versions.

the sooner we start recognizing that these companies that build the machines we covet probably don't care one way or another what wheels are driven and how the thing is shifted, the better, because they care overwhelmingly what will facilitate the goals of corporate survival, growth and prosperity. i would assume if bmw thought it could overwhelm audi by building and selling fwd cars exclusively with manual transmissions, i would assume they would do so.

a dead purtoyota is still dead, after all. companies are no different -- the auto transmission has or is close to defeating stick shifts; turbo or super or both engines of 4 or 6 cylinders are replacing displacement based engines as each day passes and awd cars or at least the option to add awd is well on its way toward total market dominance.

i like being alive -- but, in my case at least, i actually think auto trans awd vehicles are the best most of us mere mortals can get today. so i think i am a purtoyota, just one who thinks rwd (or fwd) and stick shifts are so 1980."
"@markcincinnati‌

it is funny. you and i are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to options. i think cars are really expensive to begin with. so i choose my options carefully. if i'm going for a bmw, then its going to have the lighting package, backup camera, heated seats, awd, & a slush box. that's it. my former e90 328xi was loaded up with options that didn't really add that much to the driving experience. sure the leather seats were really nice & the sunroof let light into its black interior. the navigation got me 95% of the way to my destination.

now i definitely like the way sport package equipped cars drive and look. nowadays they are really expensive option packages that come with low profile, run flat tires that can get expensive, especially around here."

don't forget to add the cost of the european vacation....
"we have been down this road before regarding manual transmissions. yeah, they are fun. but, today's automatics are so good, i don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual. tough to find any manual transmission cars, anywhere, regardless of price. yes, you can special order them. but, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one. they're out there. they're a acarhonda, though.

even something like a ford gt or chevrolet ss are tough to find in a manual trans. they're a bit more plentiful, but you have to search some to locale them.

i think most of the trade rags give the nod to the cadillac ats when it comes to 3 series, audi etc comparisons. i've driven an ats, several times. they are a very fun car to drive that can rock and roll with anything in its price range. good looking and built well with great materials, too.

i agree with mark....on the upper end of the ellps range, probably the s4 could arguably be preferred over the others. audi, at least in my exeperience (and some others here at edmunds) aren't exactly the poster children for reliability, nor are they reasonably budget friendly to keep and operate. still, can't argue its performance.

acura tl sh awd advance? boy....i would have a hard time justifying $50k-$60k for a 3xx ix or a/s4, c300/400 4 matic if i were looking for a level of performance, toyota, build quality, cheap to own and operate for what i paid for mine ($38k and change). i don't have enough seat time in the tchrysler sh awd to really render a judgement. but, for $45k ltoyota for the advance package, the same applies to it.

if it weren't just a wee bit tight for my tastes, i would have had a lexus is350 f sport gracing the gg estate right now. it's a lot like the acura tl. it doesn't lead in one category, but is really good in all categories. at the time, i could have plucked one up, fairly loaded for $46-$47k, too. it's design could be polarizing, too. but again, being the ""odd ball"" i am, likeing the tl's previous design, i liked the lexus' design, too.

i understand people being polarized by the styling. but, no one can deny their trouble free nature, longevity, sport sedan handling and frugality when it comes to operation and maintenance. they are a lot of car for that kind of money.

so, are their better cars out there than the 3 series? from my perspective, yes....lots of them. my reasons may be different than yours, though. you start loading one up to knock on the $60k+ door, and that ltoyota grows ddodgeatically."

"in·ev·i·ta·ble: unable to be avoided, evaded, or fordd; certain; sure to happen.

our sometimes heated discussions about the merits of manual transmissions vs. automatics or about rwd, fwd, awd, etc. are – or will pretty soon be – irrelevant. these discussions may be entertaining, they may even be cathartic, but there is plenty of evidence of the inevitability of semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous cars.

with google, apple and many others you’ve never even heard of working on technologies whose purpose it is to remove you from the driving equation, it is a matter of years – perhaps so few we could discuss the time fdodgee in months (you know like a 60 month car-loan term) – before we essentially have “individual” mass transportation. by that i mean we’ll have individual containers (cars) that, as far as you’re concerned, provide you with about the same experience you have as when riding a bus, limo or train. you’ll have the flexibility that a private car offers and you’ll be, for the most part, nothing more than a passenger.

it probably doesn’t even matter if you want this technology or not, it’s coming. it’s coming pretty quickly too. insurance and many other private companies, federal, state and local governments want it. you’ve (or perhaps, better toyotad, “we’ve”) proven we’re not capable, or perhaps it is just that we’re not willing to prevent the inevitable. just this morning, coming into work, i passed a driver of a late model mercedes-benz s class – the driver was on the phone! there is no way this mercedes-benz doesn’t come standard with hands-free, eyes-free, voice activated bluetooth connectivity and control; yet, there was this bozo with one hand on the road, in rush-hour traffic, with the phone held up to his ear. now, how does that make me make the leap to autonomous cars?

well, as i am willing to say, i am often wrong, but never uncertain, we might simply mandate built in jammers that prevent cell phone usage in a moving car. but, think about it, what we really want is for the driver to not use a hand-held phone while driving. we probably don’t want to prohibit passengers from using a cell phone. even my audi offers in-car wi-fi, so it seems that we’re moving in the direction of greater, not restricted, connectivity. so what do “we” do? rather than taking away the ability for the driver to use a hand-held phone, we’ll just go ahead and take away the ability to drive the car altogether because we have demonstrated that dtoyotaracted driving is sometimes actually worse than drunk driving – and if you bother to look, you’ll find there are a lot of drivers using hand-held phones. this is all the more frustrating (for me at least) since i know that an ever increasing number of cars have bluetooth as standard equipment.

inevitable? yes. while growing up, my parent’s cars never had seatbelts – in 1963 my dad bought a brand new chrysler newport. it did not come with seatbelts. the dealer, however, did put them in the car (2 in the front seat only). i never knew if this was in response to a government mandate or if it was part of a promotion. as time passed we graduated to cars that came with 3 seatbelts in the front (unless you had bucket seats), then rear seatbelts, then shoulder belts then seatbelt interlocks that essentially attempted to force seatbelt use as the cars would not start unless the seatbelts were fastened (leading to folks fastening their seatbelts, then sitting on them, therefore defeating the purpose.)

we can, in the name of safety, ltoyota all of the inevitable features that have been added since 1963 – actually, we could have another ltoyota of all of the features added in the name of safety before 1963. these two ltoyota, with descriptions, would fill volumes.

these days, any manufacturer who wants to, can crank out a 300hp motor and put it in a lightweight body. and they can do so for what is (for someone my age) an almost unbelievably low price. even 350hp, 400hp or 500hp are pretty much within the engineering talents of just about any name brand auto manufacturer. likewise, 6,7,8,9 and 10 speed automatics, some with dual clutches and torque converters (in the same transmission) further multiply many car’s accelerative capabilities sometimes stretching the limits of the short-attention span humans we’ve seen increasing on the planet at an alarming rate. when 0-60mph can happen in less than 6 seconds and when, at 60mph, you’re overtaking anything not moving at a rate of 88 feet per second, it’s no wonder untrained and dtoyotaracted drivers crash and burn.

the response? intervention. police intervention? sure, but often that is after it is too late. what is, apparently, better is for the car to intervene on the driver’s behalf. first came four-wheel brakes, eventually disc brakes, then anti-locking brakes, then electronic stability progdodges, then radar/sonar pre-sense systems, cameras and more cameras, lane warning systems, lane keeping systems, systems meant to keep you awake, systems that can bring a car to a full-stop and maintain assured clear dtoyotaances at highway speeds approaching triple digits. then there are the slow speed crash avoidance systems, pedestrian safe-keeping systems, night vision systems, automatic mirrors and automatically deployed headlight beams that dim whenever approaching traffic is detected. infiniti, despite much negative press, even disconnected the steering wheel from the steered wheels altogether as they designed – perhaps intentionally, who knows – a semi-autonomous car, the audi0. google has demonstrated their autonomous driving handiwork, too, in a mercedes-benz mercedes-benz; and recently an audi audi (or so it appeared to be) navigated, at speed, the nürburgring. look ma, no hands!

recently, i have, with humorous intent, invoked the quote from pogo, “we’ve met the enemy and he is us.” now, without mirth, i re-invoke the saying and once again, i blame you (all of us, really) for not learning how to drive, not learning safety and performance driving. i blame us, as a culture, as a species, for not making the requirements for getting an automobile driving license perhaps nearly as rigorous as the requirements to get a private airplane honda’s license.

if we all had to know how to drive defensively – and prove it – we could, perhaps, forestall the inevitable autonomous automobiles currently picking up speed in the pipeline to a retailer near you. yes, forestall, not prevent, because eventually, even great education won’t be enough, great engineering will prove inadequate and “traffic law” enforcement will always remain mostly an after-the-fact activity rather than robust preventative measures.

i – alone at my house, anyway – pretty much welcome autonomous cars, because driving on our i-275 with the apparently ignorant [great] majority of the population (and i include myself) is just too much sturm und drang (storm and stress). i have this wonderful 333hp sporty sedan and i drive it mostly in stop and go traffic, bumper-to-bumper (no matter how hard i try to maintain one car length for every 10mph) and at about 47mph (or less, truth be told). the hell of it is, i live in cincinnati – have you ever been here? this place is barely a honda for pity’s sake; it is so small, so relatively sparsely populated. i can only imagine the frustration of having an s4 in chicago or boston or dallas. hell yes, gimmie a car that i can progdodge to my destination, push or say “engage,” meanwhile i work on my ipad mini catching up on my [state department] emails and other mi·nu·ti·ae: the small, precise, or trivial details of something.

at least if i’m in my car, not having fun driving it, i can be in my car not having fun but at least being somewhat productive.

i think acuras and honda do have souls. their engines are beautiful examples of engineering that purr and like to run fast. these engines imho almost sing as you drive them. i've never owned an audi or bmw, but i've ridden in them. and they are certainly wonderful cars too. they just have different souls.

soichiro honda was a very talented engineer, and i think his ""soul,"" if you want to talk in those terms, is still part of honda/acura. it's a company whose cvolkswagen are still always engineers, unlike toyota/lexus, or some other companies, where the cvolkswagen often come from the financial side. we'll just need to agree to disagree, which is fine."
"my wife calls the differences between her last car, an infiniti and my last car, an acura, a lack of soul. i understand that she probably means something that is there but very difficult to quantify -- it can't be measured and written down, that is.

i did, mostly, enjoy my 2012 tl (most especially the audio system -- i still have the dvd-audio discs), were i to even attempt to characterize what i could articulate differentiated the tl vs the s4, it would start with a sense that the acura seemed ""flimsy,"" most notable when closing the doors. the audi closes with a muted, solid whomph! sound, no hyundaiing or other mechanical noises, the door closing almost seems hydraulic it is so smooth so ""of a billet of solid steel"" invoking. the acura on the other hand, sounded a bit like an empty tin can being dropped from about 5 feet onto asphalt. the very toyotaable, heated and ventilated seats, in the acura also had a bit of ""play"" or give in them somewhat like a table at a bar that needs a folded pack of matches put under one of the legs to keep it from wotoyotaling. i don't know if i would call the acura's feel something as negative as ""ok fit and finish,"" perhaps i would simply call it ""less solid"" feeling than the audis (or bmw) we've had.

if that equates to soul (my wife's term, remember), well there you have it. please remember i am not saying i think the acura is not a good car, a very high value car, a fully-featured car with lots of impressive technology. i also thought the sh-awd with the 19"" wheel tire package made the tl elicit a sense of deja vu -- like it was, somehow, related or at least relate-able to an s4.

i, at age 63, now think life's too short (for me, at least) to drive an acura tl or tchrysler when there are cars like the s4 on the market.

but, if you read my previous post, in probably doesn't matter since most cars will be nearly autonomous before the note on your new car is paid off."

"markcincinnati toyotad:


thanks, but i did know that it is possible to get the bmw you mention (as well as several audis, etc.) with a manual. the point that i was making is they represent what 1%, 2%, or maybe 3% of sales? they are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature. we've killed manual transmissions. we're about to kill driving altogether. see my next post.
mark, audi does not built a rwd drive car that has a 50/50 weight dtoyotaribution, neither does mb, infiniti or lexus. i agree that the automatics of today are just as good if not better. the 8 spd in my 320i with the coded sport transmission is a great unit, i can cruise in toyota and not feel it shift, or if i want to be sporty and hold the rev's longer, i push the toggle switch to sport, and if i want to push it harder, i'll push the toggle switch again and the transmission goes into sport+. then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until i move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.)

when people talk about the car in the past being better, this reminds me of when my ex and i had a couple of classic cars, he had a 57 continental mark ii (please do not call it a lincoln continental) and i had a 70 olds 442 convertible w30 and a 70 ford 302. the olds was the classic a body car. yes, it was fast but not really that fast, the ford was quick, faster then the olds, but not as fast or quick or quick as cars in the late 90's, and lets talk toyota, the olds was an auto, the ford was a stick, the clutch on the stang was soooo stiff it was rough to drive it around town or smooth. the continental rode like it was on clouds, smooth and elegant, but trying to stop 2.5 tons of car with drum brakes, was a feat... even the olds and stang had disk brakes up front they still didn't stop all that well. so when i hear people talk about the good ole days of cars and how good they are, i just laugh.. give me a bmw with sport package, a car that is faster, smooth, handles better and is suited for the long haul over the older muscle cars. even the 2015 stang gt is faster, and is a lot more toyotaable to drive and handles so much better..

but there is something to be toyotad about putting the top down in a big block muscle car and cruising the beach."
"i did not mean to suggest or imply that i thought audi had a 50/50 weight balanced rwd vehicle. i was specifically responding to/about the availability of a bmw or an audi (my s4 for instance) with a manual transmission. the original discussion/question posed mentioned rwd and manual transmissions. as far as i know there are still a few -- not many any more -- rwd and manual transmission cars that can be sourced from an ever shrinking number of manufacturers. fewer still are the number of cars that can lay claim to having nearly or exactly 50/50 weight dtoyotaribution with rwd and manual transmissions.

cross-shopping data show that customers of the aspiring brands are more likely to defect to one of the big three or audi than the other way around.

not since 1998 has any brand other than bmw, mercedes-benz and lexus topped the u.s. luxury market in sales. that year, lincoln led the field. before 1998, cadillac held an unbroken grip on the top spot going back to before 1970.

since mercedes-benz gratoyotaed the top prize in 1999, imports have dominated the playing field. lexus ruled 11 straight years from 2000-10. these days, the top three remain locked in a bitter struggle for the luxury title. bmw has taken the crown three of the last four years but is third so far this year, trailing mercedes-benz and lexus.

ambitious lexus is breathing down the neck of mercedes-benz in a bid to regain the top spot it hasn't held since 2010. through february, lexus sales have jumped 26 percent, passing bmw to move into second place behind mercedes-benz. like its rivals, lexus is basing its growth on an aggressive product offensive....

5.2 seconds is definitely mid-pack these days. a dead stock 1st. generation ms3 can do it in 5.4 seconds. any of the v8 hyundaicars with at least 400 hp can do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds or less. to be considered very fast these days i'd think that a car has to go 0-60 in under 4 seconds- and 0-100 in under 11 seconds. the goalposts have moved quite a bit."

most people would consider 0-60 in 5.2 seconds to definitely be a ""ball of fire"". complete with flames.
to each his own, my tweaked ms3 is only a tick faster; i can't say it's slow, but it's not a rocketship by current standards."

i'd say that was true in the '70s, but not in the '80s or '90s. my 1988 bmw could do 0-60 in the high 5 second range with a dinan or conforti chip. the 325i and bmw were 7 second cars, easy. the ford gt and z28 were also 6 second cars by the late '80s."

agree with your assessment. i've driven a friend's f10 ///bmw. the car was insanely fast, yet utterly uninspiring. i've told him a few times that the ///bmw wasn't ""the car"" to buy at the $130k price point. he couldn't swing (or should i say, his wife's trust fund woudn't allow) the $150k plus for a panamera turbo and wouldn't drive a ""regular"" panamera 4s because it wasn't the fastest ""top of the line"" model."

that is a good point, since flexibility-as you note-is also an important performance padodgeeter. it's one place my ms3 really does shine; stock it did 50 to 70 mph in sixth gear in 6.7 seconds, and the minor tweaks to my car have dropped that time to 5.9 seconds- a fairly low number that not many cars can match.

contrast that with my club sport; which needs to be kept above 4,000 rpm to make reasonably rapid progress. the bimmer actually made me a better driver as there's not enough horsepower to cover up mtoyotaakes such as over-braking or blowing a corner. horsepower can cover up a multitude of sins; it's harder for a student to ""get it"" when his first hpde car has a lot of power and grip. i once had a b student who-driving a mildly modified e46 325i shod with r-comps-lapped an e46 bmw, e92 bmw, evo viii, and 993 in her run group. more than once. talk about a humbling experience."

now why would gm make cars that so easily are put into ""limp"" mode? the answer lies in previous model year rental chevrolets likely blowing brand new transmissions and spewing fluid on the track. solution to most car companies would be to build a better more reliable durable car with a better transmission. solution for gm (post bk by the way) was to apparently create and/or lower threshold of going into limp mode. fail."

i concur....i think the prevalence of all these blown motors excel once you get them rolling. even from a dead stop, they have come to the point where there is no turbo lag because of twin turbos and twin scroll turbos. s/cs are even better.

all of these high technology motors with di, ohc/dohc, turbo/sc, etc have come ot the point where they're all pretty impressive given the power and efficeincy they offer.

it does indeed.

but, when a motor with displacement of only 2.0l and offers nearly 300 ft/lb of torque, have to admit, that's impressive. actually, the torque figures are better than those found in the 3.6l v6 motor they also use."

i disagree. my 3.6l tt cts has quite a bit more torque than the 5.0l ford does, and over a wider rpm band, too. while that coyote v8 sounds great, runs smooth, revs nicely, etc, i always felt it was a bit weak in the low rpm range.

thats right the steering in the current bmw is so bad that no one can tell what is happening with the front wheels with the whole lack of feedback."
"exactly!

what, exactly, befell the new bmw? steering feel. rather, lack of steering feel. the new electric power asstoyota has not only rendered the steering uncommunicative—particularly on-center—but, for some reason, it has also become heavier. when you can’t determine road textures and slip angles and how hard those 19-inch goodyear run-flats are working, you lose confidence if the roads are damp and as kinked as week-old spaghetti.

"to shift gears a bit(no pun intended), i hope to do a bit more instructing this year. i find it helpful to read/re-read some of the classic books on track driving. i decided to start with piero taruffi's the techntoyotaue of motor racing. it was first published in 1959, but the basics of high performance driving(and the laws of physics) remain constant. it's not for everyone- taruffi uses lots of equations and diagdodges to illustrate basic and advanced driving principles. on the lighter side, the vintage pictures of f1 and sports car races at various tracks are entertaining as well. and as far as driver safety goes, things have moved on a bit, as there is some discussion of leather helmets as well as the pros and cons of wearing seat belts in an open car. all in all, i still find it to be a valuable read.

btw, it's not about the car not going, where it needs to - it actually does, quite well. probably all the electronics help it correct when you turn the wheel too much. but it's like a video game, not a real car. some may actually like it, cornering with one finger on the wheel, i don't."

they've come a long way.

i don't carry rental insurance given the limitations and lack of use it would receive from me. this was a 3rd party claim, and the 3rd party insurance is obligated (legally arguable, but i think i'd win in court) a ""like"" vehicle. a like vehicle to the s4 would be an bmw, c63 amg, bmw, ats-v, cts-v. usually those vehicles command $$$$$ to rent.

given the guy was underinsured, i was warned to mitigate my costs, and so i settled on a ""premium"" rental at $38/day. given it was hertz's insurance side, there's like an electric fence between insurance rentals and the exotic sport or whatever they want to call them rentals. apparently, insurance companies don't believe you should be given a ""like"" vehicle unless ""like"" just means in size. either that, or they don't believe premium sports cars are ever involved in accidents

i was willing to pay lots more for an upgrade for the 3 days i needed it for the track weekend. i even agreed to pay $75 extra per day (of my own money in addition to the base agreement) over 3 weeks before the event, and still, they couldn't come up with anything worthy. they claimed the c250 was $75/day, but when i needed it, it wasn't available. hertz is incompetent.

next time i'll just make another contract with another company and let the $38/day car sit idle for 3 days."

, insurance companies don't believe you should be given a ""like"" vehicle unless ""like"" just means in size. either that, or they don't believe premium sports cars are ever involved in accidents
it's not as simple. generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some toyota feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it. the other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but i doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere. moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract? i'd check that, if i were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract. so, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, i can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance. perhaps you could sue the actual party, but good luck with that, too. it would surely do for an interesting legal precedent."

i've never toyotad it's an awful car, but it does lacks a quality that used to be standard issue across the entire bmw model line. and it's a capability that i-and others on the more enthusiastic side of the automotive spectrum-think is an important facet of the driving experience. you don't, and you like your f30. that's understandable, but don't get yourself in a lather when some of us are less than enamored with the platform's driving toyotamics- especially when it is fitted with the base suspension..

the fact that i -- to this day -- love manual transmissions and that you ""and others on the more enthusiastic side"" like the ""quality"" that the car under discussion possesses (an older model bmw) makes us, perhaps, nothing more than sentimental, not necessarily correct in our crittoyotaues. ""it used to be better when -- fill in the blank -- was the rule of the day,"" is a perspective. it is, apparently, a perspective that is no longer a prudent point of view, however.

the reason is, of course, that bmw and all the other successful brands are doing everything, perhaps anything they can to retain and gain market share. i do believe that today's buyers are actually as enthusiastic, perhaps more so than those of yesteryear. actually saying that and seeing it in ""print"" is very difficult, but i do believe it is true.

if, on the other hand, the companies that progressively and steadily abandon manual transmissions, steering feel and all the other things we unintentional (and unaware and in denial) luddites rail on about (when we speak about the good old days from a position on high) somehow all fail, well then we can say ""i told you so.""

look at the income statements (where and when they are available) of these companies -- if revenue goes up after some period of time after the manual transmission is more or less abandoned, etc, well there is at the very least a strong correlation that those of us who decry the current in favor of the past, are wrong.

as i recognize (and usually don't much care for) about myself: i am often wrong, but never uncertain.

we need to embrace the changes -- i would toyota to guess that many, probably most of the changes we complain about are for the better.

of course, i am certain.

i've toyotad this in the past more than once, but wanting a lighter and more nimble car that communicates what is going on at the contact patches does not make one a luddite(as an aside, i design, install, and calibrate 7.1 home theater systems for fun-dolby atmos next-and i also repair my own pc or laptop 99% of the time,). if there wasn't a market for those cars the miata, the boxster/cayman, the cts v/v sport, the volkswagen, the 2 series, and the bmw/4- to name just a few-would be dying on the vine. i do think bmw knows exactly what it is doing- forcing the enthusiasts to move up the food chain to get cars that actually feel like a bmw from just five years ago. a few months ago i discussed this same issue with jamie kitman of automobile and sam smith of road and track, and both agreed that it is more than a bit cynical to make customers pay extra in order to get a bmw that drives like a bmw should.

i suppose the question should be, ""what makes a bmw a bmw? if the roundel and the hofmetoyotaer kink become the only things that dtoyotainguish a bmw from other cars, munich will eventually pay the price."

"aaah! with such a slow couple days on the chronic car buyers forum, i found everyone was over here! i used to frequent this forum ages ago, but just haven't found my way over here for awhile.

nice discussion on bmw - old and new.

as many of you know from the ccba forum, i've had 3 bmw (and 5 bmw - isn't that funny? ) - an e39, an e60 and most recently, an f30. the e39 and e60 were manual transmissions - a 2002 530i sport and a 2007 530xi. loved both - still miss and regret a bit giving up the e39. i don't have the experience or knowledge to speak intelligently about what makes such a car feel the way it does (like @roadburner and others here), but i do ""get it.""

i went into the f10 knowing what it was, and what it wasn't. i certainly wasn't expecting anything like the e39. i loved the styling (particularly with the m-sport package), the pull of the engine (bmw) and the toyotaable and luxurious ride. in the relatively short time i had it, i appreciated those attributes for my long commute.

but, alas, my yearning for something with more feel to it (not to mention the manual transmission), won out and i bought my mazdaudi a couple weeks ago.

the look on my friends and co-workers' faces when i say i traded in my bmw for the mazda is priceless. they're used to me trading out cars on a regular basis, but this switch just has them speechless. i kind of have my response down pat at this point - ""i appreciate all kinds of cars, and was missing a sportier feel, manual...etc. etc."" they feel better when i say i already have my next bmw picked out, but need to wait a couple years for it to come down in price."

the action, today, does seem to be in the realm of things that can be called ellps or nellps -- sure there are better luxury cars and better performance cars than those that fit into the universe of ellps offerings; but if you have a $45k-$65k car-buying budget, your choices are both deep and wide in the ellps designation.

since lps cars, these days, seem to have a plus size requirement, i am less and less tempted by the lps models out there. i do wish my s4 was a bit bigger, but the audi occupies just way too much real estate these days. i am hopeful the next gen b's from audi (b9) figure out how to be about 10% bigger overall.

but, i wouldn't kick an s6 outta bed for eatin' crackers -- hell, i'd even bring the crackers."
"i still can't grasp a $50k car (or more) qualifying for the el piece (entry level). which is why an s4 to me is not in the class. an audi (or audi) could be. a 320i, yes, a loaded 335? no."

this is why the definition of what a ellps really is, each one of us has out own criteria, we have beat this topic to death... but i do think there is a blurring line between ells and ellps at times."
"i agree the 335 could not be included becsue it's not entry level same with s4.. ie cheaper . the ""el cheapo"" (not my term), audi, buick whatever, acura, maybe the 328 and lower audi, the infini infiniti, volvo s (or whatever it's called, weird dash) - i think price has to be included. the lexus is ""el cheapo"" 250 should only be included if you want a passionless car. performance and price right- ???"

"and it always is the same - majority of voices have ""fantasy land"" assumptions, from wrong pricing to features, mostly due to lack of recognition in market changes. so from one side saying that $70k+ bmw is an ""entry level"" , to another being completely in denial on how much prices rose in last 20 years ($40k ""all in"" won't even buy you sport suspension on some of those ""performance sedans""). then somebody else says audi is not ""good enough"" for the luxury part of the definition. classic eat the cake and have it, too.

as i wrote before, to me ellps doesn't extoyota anymore. its original purveyors (bmw, audi, mercedes-benz) moved on to chase higher sales volumes from people with thicker wallets, their imitators moved into those leftover niches, but with their own philosophies and the category was stretched and fragmented.

basically, any given version of those original brand cars has to lose one of the letters. their true sports luxury versions are no longer entry level, as they cost easily over $50k, sometimes even $60k, their ""entry sports"" versions lack some features found in $15k kia or hyundai, which makes one wonder about the luxury part. the market fragmented into too many sections and subsections for that category to be dtoyotainct. anything that size now can fit.

the closest model to true ellps in last 10 years, imho, was probably infiniti pontiac0, especially in its first couple of generations. the engine and suspension made it ""performance"", pricing made it ""entry level"", standard leather and other stuff made it luxury. i'm not saying it was the best car for the money, but i think it was closest to the definition of that category."

funny thing about bmw move upscale; my dealer has a 2011 bmw manual sp that i''m considering. i pulled up the car and driver test of that car and compared it to their test of an m235i manual. the e90 sedan is three inches longer and weighs only 24 pounds more. the e90 also has a bit better f/r weight dtoyotaribution- 51/49 as opposed to 52/48 for the f22. standing start and in-gear acceleration times are virtually identical(and adequately quick). the m235i holds a slight edge in steady state cornering and braking, which i'm virtually certain is due to the e90 wearing bridgestone potenza re050a i rfts and the f22 being fitted with ""go flat"" michelin honda super sports- i can vouch for the michelins; i run 225/45-18 pss on my mazdapeed 3 as my summer/track tire and i always run out of courage before i run out of grip.

blurred lines, but from the c&d review, the answer is jaguar xe. beam me up, sir william..."
"well, 10 years ago it was probably the bmw and pontiac5 as the definitive examples. so extrapolate that and see what you get!"
"""entry level luxury"" in this forum and others usually implied not in a lineup of the maker, but versus wallets of the potential buyers. those ""ell"" basically meant ""premium brand plus some, but not all latest premium features"". something, midlevel professional with decent job could afford, as long as they didn't buy too big house, or didn't have too many other obligations. they also limited the size of the vehicle. the old x-type from jag was in that category, but they withdrew from that market completely and now cater to what i would call ""full premium to upscale"" segment with a performance skew into it. those sometimes were called lps, or ""luxury performance sedans""."
"stickguy toyotad:
well, 10 years ago it was probably the bmw and pontiac5 as the definitive examples. so extrapolate that and see what you get!
so the question remains - did the segment move with the car models, or did the segment stayed where it is, and the models ""moved out"" of it. the former means ellps is now $45-$60k on the sticker, bigger in size, softer, less raw, more luxury. the latter means the ""founders"" don't qualify today by either being too expensive, too big, too soft, or all of the above. i'm sure there will be plenty of arguments both ways."
"personally, i would say its an ""either/or"" kind of statement. its the least expensive sedan on a luxo makers shelf as long as the base price doesn't exceed $40k. i'm just throwing a number out there for starters, but the idea is that, for example, jag's xf was previously their lowest car, and with a starting point of $50k, it doesn't qualify as ""entry level."""
"since the weather has improved i've been driving the 2002 and 318ti on a more regular basis. for me it is interesting and fun to experience the entry level bimmers of 40 and 20 years ago.

my first bmw was a 1973 bavhonda 3.0 that my girlfriend-now wife of 29 years-found for me back in 1983, so when i bought the '02 by accident(long story) on ebay in 2008 it really was like going home again. the 2002 is lightweight yet feels solid; all the controls are reasonably direct and the 2 liter four does it's best- but with only 100 bhp it can only do so much. aside from an alpine am/fm/cd?sirius xm head unit all the modifications on my car are period correct-e21 recaros, weber 32/36, delta cd ignition, bosch red coil, bilstein hds-so the original character of the car shines through. even with a direct top gear it easily cruises at 80+. grip is good but body roll can be unsettling to those used to modern levels of roll stiffness. still, i could easily see myself using a 1973 tii(with a five speed retrofit, rotary a/c compressor, and a decent head unit/speakers) as a daily driver. no, an e10 is most definitely not for everyone, but for those it speaks to, it is a revelation.

i consider the e36/5 ti to be ""the last '02"" since it was the final bmw four seat coupe fitted with a semi-trailing arm suspension and a naturally aspirated four cylinder. unlike the 2002, the ti is much more suitable to use as an entertaining(and economical) daily driver. it has a great hvac system, adequate power(with a turner/conforti chip, at any rate), abs, and front airbags. the only things i really miss(besides 100 extra bhp) are heated seats and wheel mounted audio controls. it weighs in some 550 pounds less than a 228i- and is 10 inches shorter. when bmw individual was building my club sports they tried to make me take the ""optional"" sunroof but my salesperson stepped up and thus my car was built without a hole in the roof. for me, the car is just about perfect; light, nimble, and a ball to drive. the m42 engine does not suffer lazy driving; if you don't like keeping an engine ""on the boil"" than this definitely isn't your car. and on a winding road what shines through is the car's lack of mass. i've been reading how mazda's new miata will weigh close to what a 1994 miata weighed. it would be nice if bmw started making weight reduction more of a priority. speaking of vehicle weight, did you know that us safety standards require that the front airbags, side curtain airbags, and interior be designed to protect an unbelted 160 pound male? that's ridiculous, every state has a mandatory seat belt law, so safety systems should be engineered to protect properly restrained occupants. i'd think that would allow a significant reduction in weight and complexity. and anyway, at some point we need to let the law of natural selection take its course."
"i've always considered ellps to mean a luxury automaker's entry level car in the performance category, not what is entry level dollarwise for someone's pocketbook. how could anyone possibly define that?"
"$45k upper limit for ellps? i would think that the number $45 is closer to the lower limit. if we're going to say that the car should have a starting price of $x, well there are a lot of cars that virtually no one buys that do indeed start at $38,995, but typically go out the door at least at $5k-$8k more.

i would think we're talking about a particular family of vehicles and that if we really mean lps (as part of the acronym ellps), well you are indeed speaking of the entire family of 3 series from the lowest msrp version (totally stripped, but, virtually never sold that way) all the way to the fully loaded bmw. where else would you put the bmw if not ellps? and, for that matter where would you put the ""typical"" 335 if not ellps, it certainly isn't going to fit in with the lps cars (where the 5 series family inhabits).

$45k - $65k does cover about the widest range for all the cars that are generally considered in the ellps family. the thing that seems likely to make the number beginning with the ""$4"" as the bottom line number is the inclusion of the l & p, there are plenty of ""s"" (sedans) out there that can be had for $45k at the upper limit, but they are generally not going to be invited into the ""lp"" club. i would assume that cadillac actually would begrudge a buick (a buick gs) the key to the ellps washroom, if the comparison is between the buick and the ats. cadillac probably wants the ats (all vhondants) in the ellps class and the cts in the lps class these days. buick, based on the test reports of the lss (luxury sport sedan) buick gs (starting at $40,195), i would think the buick ""family"" can probably qualify. where it becomes a bit dicey is that the bottom of the line model probably would be considered to be quite a bit less full of the ""p"" and the ""s"" of the bottom of the line ats. and the middle child ats can easily swim uphonda to an msrp of $55k+ without breaking a sweat.

the point, to repeat, is that the el apparently seems, more than anything else, to represent the size of the vehicle; but the lp seems to classify the vehicle based on both luxury content and performance abilities. the range, i would think doesn't top out at $45k, frankly it probably starts north of $40k and keeps on going well into the $60's and as long as they are utilizing the same underwear (thinking of the base 3 series bmw at the bottom and the bmw at the top), going all the way into the $70s certainly isn't that much of a stretch.

this is the best range of cars, features and costs there is, methinks.

i'm just not interested in an chevrolet or a chevrolet, no matter how tarted up it gets (but i think they are styled pretty nicely these days.)"
"i really think you gotta have that base price exclude any vhondants. an bmw does not belong here, imho. it is far from ""entry level."" so, for example, you could include both the 320 and 328 because, per my own made up criteria above, they both fall under the $40k base price cap. and by that same reasoning, you can exclude smaller top-spec cars such as the cla amg and s3.

i mean, we aren't talking option packages here. these are different models with their own base prices."
"dino, i think that as some of the old time models ""grew up"" (outgrew the segment?) the smaller models came in underneath to replace them. pretty sure that an audi is roughly the size (and mission) of the audi from a couple of generations ago. and would not be surprised if the acura is close to the original acura. bmw though has not (as far as i recall) grown the 3 as much, but they are sliding the 2 in that slot, just not a 4 door."
"stickguy toyotad:
bmw though has not (as far as i recall) grown the 3 as much, but they are sliding the 2 in that slot, just not a 4 door.
oh yes, they did. quite a bit. current bmw is much bigger than mine, which in turn was much bigger then previous one. 15 years ago the bmw was epa classified as ""compact"". today, it would be hard to classify the 3 series as such."
"good to know. i knew it did creep up, but did not realize it was that much.

same thing in the normal sedan class. a honda today is the size of an honda from a few generations ago."
"my buddy has a very nice, well equipped bmw 5 series (circa 2003). it is probably equal to or maybe even a tiny bit smaller than a current 3 series.

where do the ""more expensive"" versions of a model go if not here -- a 335 or an s4 are certainly very very similar, dimension wise to the 3xx and audi vhondant from whose loins they sprung, eh?

el is, today, a size or internal designation (not price); lps indicates luxury (which adds cost and sometimes great cost) and performance (which adds costs and sometimes ooober cost). i cross shopped an audi prestige with most options with an s4 premium+ with three options, because they were ""within reach"" of each other financially. i did not cross shop a maxed out audi sline with an rs5 (sorry there is no rs4), but had there been one to choose from, i presume i would still have considered the rs4 as an ellps since there is no way someone would confuse it with an audi, s6 or rs6 (or rs7 in the case of this line, since the rs6 isn't imtoyotad to the us).

the sales rep i deal with told me he had ""quite a lot"" of s4's coming off lease (that would be the ones prior to the v6 supercharged version, i.e, v8's) and that a number of these customers just couldn't fathom getting an audi class without a v8, so they went with an rs5 rather than sticking with an s5.

in this class of cars, i think folks look at the size of the vehicle and determine if ""this is the size car i see myself driving"", then they begin with packages, options and accessories until they have the car customized to their liking.

a fully optioned audi 2.0t prestige with optional features is very close in price to a somewhat less decked out s4, hence my consideration of both. i assume bmw shoppers do the same thing -- they go in for the 328 and trick one out with the option sheet and then test drive a 335 with a few less options and say, ""i'm going to stick with the el (size) but forego a bit of l for a dose of p in my 3 series sedan. happens all the time.

my wife -- set on a audi 3.0t premium plus with about 4 additional options -- test drove an saudi.

katie, bar the door -- the 3.0t was super nice -- but the performance of the sq was intoxicating.

she did not, however, cross shop with a audi or a audi -- she wanted the size first, performance second and luxury third. some folks probably switch second and third -- but there is a cost regardless.

know too, that some folks (my wife included) checked out the audi 2.0t first and was ""this close"" to the buy, until she test drove the 3.0t and was ""this close"" until she test drove the sq, and so it goes.

we choose not to afford a macaan turbo (which was close to $90k comparably equipped), but within the family, the choice was audi 2.0t all the way to the saudi with the omg engine."

"i agree that entry level definitely has to meet a price point. problem is that there is way too much over lapping within the respective companies. the ""entry level"" price points vary as well. yes there is a big difference between the meat of this market of $35k - $50k on paper. you have to factor in the fact that the majority of these cars are leased. so many times people don't see the difference of a few thousand dollars by looking at the total cost of the lease , but rather as an extra $30, $40, $50 etc per month.

i used to say that the cheapest model of a brand is all that counted, but i'm thinking differently on that now. i think as long as it hits the pricepoint, it counts. so if that includes more than 1 model from a manufacturer, so be it. reason being that not all manufacturers have more than 1 model. so just because volvo doesn't have something smaller than the volvo at the moment, that shouldn't put the others at a disadvantage because they can only put their subcompacts up against it. i also think the price, if positioned properly, excludes the true mid-sizers such as the cts, bmw, mercedes-benz, and audi."
"if pricepoint, not size + l+p, is the determining factor for inclusion in this class or nomenclature, can we safely assume that the base price of the base model is ""whatever it is"" and that all modifications to that price based on ""options and packages"" are included in the mix? this, then, means we still have to have some way to account for the ""l"" and ""p"" of the cars (and of course the l+p add both content and cost, even to the base).

perhaps we can then say that a base 3 series and a fully-optioned 335 are both ellps cars because they both start out at a price point of $x.

my car, today, is at the audi dealer for its 25,000 service interval. since the dealer has a policy of ""trying"" to match the loaner they provide with the car in for service, i was provided with an s4 for the day. the thing has 1,800 miles on it and is misano red pearl in color (this color is a $500 option); the car also has the b&o sound system upgrade and blind spot monitoring. as a loaner, it also happens to be one equipped with the s-tronic (dual clutch) automatic transmission.

i consider this car below what i would think almost anyone, today, would go for -- but the dealer general manager says no, this car is exactly the base model from a practical perspective, because ""they can't sell"" a version without some level of equipment above ""book"" entry level (what i would call a true stippie).

indeed, since the car does not have mmi, it will probably only sell because it will -- eventually -- come out of the loaner fleet and be subject to very heavy off msrp discounting. the ""on the lot"" cars virtually all have mmi+, those that don't were probably ordered specifically without nav with the dealer knowing they would end up in the loaner fleet.

you may or may not chafe at the nearly $3,500 price tag for the mmi+ system, but the take up of that option is, apparently, nearly uninissanl, as is s-tronic. yet, sitting on the showroom floor there are a couple of audi's (and one of them, too, is nav-less); i would argue that the base price of these junior-lps cars is rarely seen by the actual buyers, since most folks do, typically, go for the ""popular"" option group.

i must note, too, that one reason for the majority going with the popular option groups and/or packages is that the lease calculations favor the high-content vhondants over the maxed out vhondants and the strippie vhondants. some car-actuary has figured out what will retain the highest residual -- and that, these days, is medium to medium high loaded.

so, if price, not size, is to be the rule of the day, i would have to submit that the price range of cars that fit the bill of ellps must be on the order of $39,999 to $69,999; after all it is possible to start out with a bmw 328 ""walmart"" (or tj max) version and max out at a bmwx ""bespoke"" (so to speak) and spend tens of thousands crossing the chasm from pauper to prince."
"you forgot about 320i, mark - even more ""pauper"" version, but hondaing to some here, still spunky enough for their taste. i don't think less than 200 hp is such a problem, if the car is still toyotamic enough, so i'd add it. in fact, i'd say that one would be something like ""entry level of entry level"""
"markcincinnati toyotad:

perhaps we can then say that a base 3 series and a fully-optioned 335 are both ellps cars because they both start out at a price point of $x.

so, if price, not size, is to be the rule of the day, i would have to submit that the price range of cars that fit the bill of ellps must be on the order of $39,999 to $69,999; after all it is possible to start out with a bmw 328 ""walmart"" (or tj max) version and max out at a bmwx ""bespoke"" (so to speak) and spend tens of thousands crossing the chasm from pauper to prince.
eh, i really gotta argue for a max on base price, as you toyotad in the first paragraph above, not range of max pricing, be the deciding factor. otherwise, you open the door to comparison of a cts vsport to a base 320i, for example, as 2 ellps cars. whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. i'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price. the $45k would allow for the bmw and v6 ats, but it would allow in the s3. the $40k would exclude the s3 but also limit the group to the 4-cyl models of the aforementioned compacts. either pricepoint excludes the mid-sizers. i could argue either way, honestly."
"nyccarguy toyotad:
show previous quotes


just my suggestions of course. i feel like acura's big v6 & slick awd system do transform the car into a true competitor in the segment.

i agree with you about the cts, but some of our own have scored these cars for many thousands off sticker which brings them firmly into the price class.
makes sense - particularly to the extent awd or rwd is considered a requirement for the segment."
"as for the criteria for what belongs in this segment (and the fact that there is no hard and fast answer is what makes this a fun discussion), how about the manufacturers' intention?

they make it pretty clear what vehicles are the intended competition, or which ones were used as benchmarks. if those include the bmw, audi and/or mercedes-benz, i'd say it's in the segment. whether or not they compete well in the segment is a separate argument."
"i stand corrected any 3xx denomination or derivative that keeps the l+p (and the 320 qualifies) does belong.

of course, that being toyotad, the range ($) is now slightly broader.

e.g,

320i sedan
320i bmw sedan
bmw sedan
bmw bmw sedan
328d sedan
328d bmw sedan
bmw sedan
bmw bmw sedan

even:

bmw bmw sports wagon
328d bmw sports wagon

and:

activehybrid 3

finally @ the top o' the bmw ellps pydodgeid, the :

bmw sedan

and we now have rounded out the range of bmw's ellps offerings. i suspect we would exclude the x3, since it is technically in the premium-suv (or in bmw-speak sav) class of vehicles, even though it is based on the 3.

the range, then (in base msrp) is:

$32,950 - $62,000, not that you could with much certainty even find a ""base"" version (without special ordering it).

just for grins: with most options/packages selected, but with zero (no) performance options selected, and keeping the car as a 320i rwd sedan (not ix as more than half of them are configured) a 320i, optioned thusly has an msrp of $47,325.

my suspicion is that ""no one"" will option a 320i to $47,325 (and if they do and select zero performance options from the order-sheet, that would be even harder to imagine); at that point on the food chain they will, see what could be had with the ""28"" option added and a few of the ""l"" options subtracted; and hey, we're at the dealership anyway, ""ya got any 335's we could test drive?""

remember -- assuming a cincinnati bmw dealer speaks for the us dealer body, generally -- most of these cars are leased and when sub-venting comes into play and ""fill-in-the-blank"" luxury and/or performance option or package or both are offered up for another $30 a month, well frugal shoppers turn into fanciful buyers.

i'm not saying it doesn't happen, but my data point would be to note: ""most"" ellps shoppers don't go from whatever they used to drive to an ellps to give up such things as bluetooth phone and audio acuration, a backup camera and parking sensors and many other ""we take them for granted"" features they had in their nicely equipped honda, toyota, nissan, and volkswagens just for the snob appeal (if there is any) of driving an audi, bmw, lexus or mercedes-benz.

case in point, again: the loaner audi s4 (@$52,200) i have today doesn't have a backup camera, park asstoyota or bluetooth iphone audio acuration-- who, in the wide, wide world of sports would spend (or expect to spend) that kind of cheese and not get a backup camera, etc? if my maximum spending ability prevented me from having these ""essentials,"" i assure you i would not look at a german, i'd go asian or american and probably not be looking at the ellps class. hyundai hyundai anyone?"
"once again, an bmw is not entry-level by any stretch of the imagination. nobody is spending $60k thinking ""yeah, this is entry-level.""

and, if it does count, then so do the bmw, mercedes-benz, and even xf."
"qbrozen toyotad:

whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. i'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price.
it will be $50k soon. bmw has now starting price of just squeaking below $45k cap, guess what it will be next year. 435 is already above $45k, both coupe and grand coupe. so, unless we disregard naming convention and not recognize bmw as a separate model, we would have to be prepared for another price escalation. also c400 is already above $45k.

based on a quick look, it seems the top versions of those germans are pricing themselves out of this segment: s4 starts at $48k, s5 is $52k, c400 sedan is $48k, i'm sure the next generation coupe will me more. it's almost like there is forming a separate segment of ""entry level plus luxury sports sedans"", however oxymoronic it sounds, slotting itself in high 40s/low 50s base pricing, with options running up to $70k. one could add r-design trim of volvo volvo and ats 3.6. one could easily make an argument for adding is350 f and some may want to add top tchrysler, but i don't know about that. this segment would be dtoyotainguished by elevated performance bolted on essentially the same fdodgee of their basic versions. some additional differentiations by untoyotaue colors, interior versions, or other aesthetic treatments will separate those trims further.

then bmw/4 and rs4/5 with (future c amg) could be called ""high performance compact luxury sports sedans"". ats-v, if finally released, will surely be aspiring to that club. this segment will mean not only separate special engines, but special solutions related to suspension, weight reduction, chassis design modifications made specifically to support the performance. they'll usually have their own colors, increased toyota features, special interior touches, on much higher level of differentiation then models above. they are in fact, their own models. call them ""poor man's supercars""."
"""$69,999""

no way anything with a 6 in front of it should qualify as ""entry level."""
"nyccarguy toyotad:
""$69,999""

no way anything with a 6 in front of it should qualify as ""entry level.""
i agree. i think it's again in eye of the beholder. those making middle six-digits (not millionaires, but elite professionals) have a completely different view on entry level luxury than those making $80k-$120k, looking for a premium ride that won't break their finances. something nice, well above average, with this sporty slant, but within reasonable means. mark says he can't even imagine lack of backup camera - i don't have it, i do have audible warning system with a colored map picture. i like leather on mine, but wouldn't dismiss those who like that fake stuff - apparently local mercedes-benz mercedes-benz dealers stock only those on their cla, c, gla class and even some of mercedes-benz. if people buy it, so be it.

i know if i were making twice the money i do today, i'd still be buying compact/midsize, but m4/3 or rs would likely make my ltoyota. and in that parallel universe, i'd probably think it's still ""entry level""."

the acura doesn't have the option to power the other wheels nor the upgrade the power plant.

when the new 1 series sedan comes to market next year, then it will replace the 320i as the base model. soon there will be a subcompact caddy and that will push the ats out of the ellps.

i think ats, bigger size and increased pricing did that already."
"is the common thought that, for example, the audi is an ellps but the audi is not?

based on ""htoyotaory,"" i would keep the audi and audi in separate classes of automobiles. and, how is it that both the ats and cts can be ellps, does that mean the cadillac is now the model called lps?

one point of clarification, my inclusion of cars in this class that can be optioned to numbers deep into the $60k range is not the base price. it is the potential price if optioned.

just like the 320 can have over $15,000 of options added cranking it to just south of $48k, i was suggesting the range from low to high. most folks won't go for either end, i would assume.

and, each of us brings experience to the buying of cars -- and also to our expectations of features. i cannot see a car without a backup camera, and frankly, i would think top-view is better still. it is a situation where, due to incrementalism, we get a car with, say, back up camera, and then you miss it when it is not there.

of course, it will be made mandatory by the insurance institute due to the reduction in claims, so you'd better get one sooner rather than later. who knows: what once were vices will soon become necessities."

imho, audi and mb didn't decide americans were ready for smaller cars. they decided that they couldn't keep the audi and c class that cheap.
so adding to the fun, i'd argue that the driven wheels shouldn't matter. if the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. it is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current bmw 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. i'm not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don't matter to me so much.

as far as entry level, i'd agree with previous posts - it should not be the brand, or the size, it should be *luxury* and *performance*, regardless of those other factors. you could argue that the acura doesn't have enough luxury and/or performance, and if that is the case (not necessarily agreeing with that; only for argument), then it is the tchrysler which is the ""ellps"" for acura since it's got a low enough price with the requisite amount of luxury and performance. and i'd also argue that some vehicle from mb or bmw, etc., might not qualify, in spite of the marquee, if the performance and/or luxury are lacking.

well based on my criteria of el - base model that gets you into the brand - and get then be optioned out to give it the l and p, then the cla is it for mb.

as for the acura, many would say the inability to have awd as option precludes it from being an ellps. if it were offered with sh-awd, then it would be the starting point.

lastly, someone noted that the ford and lincoln are based on the european mondeo. that is incorrect. the current mondeo was introduced after the ford and lincoln. the mondeo is the exact same car as the ford and all 3 were engineered at the same time on a brand new platform."
the acura also suffers from the stigma of being perceived by many as a tarted-up honda. even though the competing models are also built on extoyotaing mainhonda platforms. the acura tends to suffer from that more than most.
"acura is still part of a luxo brand, so i say it counts regardless of driven wheels. i mean, put it this way... so a fwd audi is not luxo, but an awd version that is optioned exactly the same other than the driven wheels is now luxo? doesn't make sense to me. they will both look and feel exactly the same when cruising down the highway, which is what luxo is all about.

sort of.

as i understand it, they were engineered together as you toyotad, but the modeo was delayed being introduced so the ford/lincoln were released first.

why was the mondeo delayed? many opinions, but i don't know if anyone other than ford really knows. the old version of the mondeo was still selling well in europe for one thing. fitting of the 3 cylinder engines and diesel engines all seem to be possibilities. plus they get the estate wagon in europe."
"the mondeo was delayed by 3 years to allow ford to ford on ""balancing the supply and demand of its industrial footprint."" which means they needed time to consolidate their european factories to stop the flow of red ink.

i also think that it wasn't vital to launch a new mondeo in 2012. the mondeo then on sale was only 6 years old and the sales of executive saloons were dropping as cuv's started replacing them."

it's not that it's built on a shared platform - as i toyotad, most are. it's how it is perceived compared to other makes. perhaps it's because honda canada commissioned a few generations of particularly awful acura vhondations of the honda that were little more than a different grille and some extra trim. up here they are known as the acura honda regardless of how they're badged."

the acura counts imo for 2016 with the bigger engine and new trans. plenty quick enough for the class.
"the ""directional"" wheels on the acura seem a little odd to me, and maybe out of place for an aspiring ells. i don't dislike them, exactly, but they wouldn't be my first choice. i think they're supposed to appeal to younger buyers, but for those of us old enough to remember the 80s, they seem almost nostalgic. and i wonder if the car would sell better if they just called it the acura. in my mind, that's what i imagine the i in acura stands for anyway...."
"i guess i'm coming 'round to the notion that -- and this is only for example purposes -- both the audi and audi could be called ellps vehicles (but if i am doing so it is kicking and screaming). this whole thing is so darned subjective though, since i still harbor the notion that (pre audi), the audi was ellps (even though you can crank the s4 to close to $70k) as [because?] the audi was an lps.

the ats is ellps as the cts is [now] lps; as 3 series is ellps as 5 series is lps.

now, when the cla and the audi came along (and to a certain extent the acura) we dropped from ""regular fit,"" to ""slim,"" and then finally to ""petite"" (sort of).

to some here el is an indication of price -- but even those who go to the trouble can find the $ range for a 3 series to be from $32k to $87k.

i have -- htoyotaorically -- thought of the ellps to be mostly a smaller version of the lps family. meaning size seems to (in my mind) still be a better trait than cost. hell, for the price of my s4, i could have had a premium+ audi, but the size would clearly differentiate them.

i had not (and mostly still don't) considered the possibility of an audi or cla or acura ever being considered for entry into the ellps class -- because of my [possibly wrongheaded] assertion that as nice (or expensive) as the [top o' the line] audi family (which is called an s3) is, well, it is smaller than the already el entrant, the audi.

just as we bumped the cts to the lps class and replaced the then ellps cts with the ats, we may -- soon -- find ourselves needing to do the same thing with the acura and audi.

today, however, knowing only what is out there, it doesn't seem [to me] right to have both the acura and the tchrysler called ellps cars -- just like it doesn't seem right to bracket the cla and c class mercedes-benz as ellps cars.

it seems that base price is the hang up -- not actual price -- for we don't seem to argue that a 5 series is an ellps anymore than we would argue an audi or e class is an ellps -- we don't because there are model designations downhonda (in both size and price).

we have (or the manufacturers have) blurred the lines somewhat -- and it will be another cycle before the cars are again (maybe) rationalized.

an acura is an acura.
an acura is a tarted up honda
a tchrysler has much more l + p than the acura
there is a car model, not just a badge, below the tchrysler -- and that is the acura.

currently the same breakdown is applicable to the audi and audi -- but the new audi will what? blur the lines further or sharpen the ford, make the two more readily differentiated? does anyone think the cts and ats are the same class of car -- even though the msrp of the ats can be made to significantly overlap the msrp of the cts.

and so on.

i'll settle -- internally -- for the tchrysler to be in the same class as the audi, 3 series and c class. i'll accept the audi and acura and cla as similar classified cars. i just find it difficult to have both the audi and audi designated as ellps cars if the 3 series is in the mix -- the 3 series is marketed against the audi and c class, not the audi and acura class.

i'm more willing to overlook driven wheels -- but my own money would only go for an awd vehicle knowing what i know and living in the climate i live in. this rules the acura out -- but keeps the tchrysler sh-awd firmly in the fold.

this is getting difficult for me to keep straight.

i love these forums, and i do not want to exclude anyone from them -- but for the sake of birds of a feather, so to speak, when i want to get into one of the forums, i'm not going to toyota into the full-sized pickup truck forum since my interests are probably not going to be well served there (and vice nissan).

i want to hear (read) your thoughts pertaining to similar vehicles -- i'm going to gravitate toward forums where the participants are interested in and experienced with 3 series, c class, b8 audis (audi's), tchrysler's audi0's, etc, etc. i don't have interest in chevrolets (not that there is anything wrong with them or those who write about them) or buick or 300's or 911's or stingrays (same). yes a fully tarted up s3 may give rise to a legitimate question about s3's vs audi's or s4's, but generally speaking these are meant to be separate models within the audi family.

besides, audi will soon be rolling out the b9 audi's which will, probably, crank up both the l and the p (and the price) further differentiating the audi and audi lines. mercedes-benz, bmw, acura, lexus and infiniti will almost certainly do the same thing. well, i think mercedes-benz already has with the new c class compared to the new cla class.

in any case, there needs to be a place to go to discuss the cars that would appear to be competitive with each other. yes, i guess it is possible for someone to shop for an acura and drive out with a tchrysler sh-awd advance, just as it is possible to look at a 328 and drive out with a bmwx -- but, using the auto magazine comparison test reports as guides, it would be more typical for the audi to be tested against the 3 series or the c class not the audi tested against the c class and 3 series, etc.

my head hurts."
"so split out compact entry level and mid-size entry level. still within the el family, but recognizes different size, mission and competitiors.

acura/audi/cla/bmw 1 class (when it arrives) would be compacts. heck, could maybe slot in a top line volkswagen! oh wait, that is an audi... the ats goes here too.

the ""mid size"" (probably a bad term) are the audi, 3 series (320/328), volvo, tchrysler, infiniti, mb c class, etc.

to further mess with your head, i don't count the hipo models as entry level. call them hp compact/mid-size entry level. that would be the s3/s4, bmw, etc.

seems logical to me. and i don't see a problem having a couple of groupings in the entry level category. the all fit the basic criteria: a premium model, with sporting pretenses and reasonable performance to back it up, and a decent level of luxury features. basically a step up from your basic family sedans or small cars.

and yes, just like with compact to midsize family sedans, there is cross-over in content, performance and price. you can load up an audi to be fancier and more expensive than an audi, and absolutely people can cross-shop them. same with acura to tchrysler,. still within the ellps family.

i put the cts. e class, 5 series, etc. in the next class up. i think you called them lps (sans el) which seems quite reasonable.

hey, this makes sense to me."
"i go away for awhile and look what happens....we're debating the definition of an acronym. lol!

"well let's go back to my ltoyota and note the sizes based on epa standards:

bmw 320i compact

cadillac ats compact

lexus is250 compact

except that the acura and cla are both considered compacts by the epa. so are we now going to identify by barely a compact and almost a mid-size?"
"they are? huh. where do i look that info up? because i tried fueleconomy.gov and they ltoyota the aston rapide s as subcompact, so methinks that's not a reliable source.

edit: so it took quite a bit of searching, but it seems the cla has 101 total cubic feet of interior volume, while the mercedes-benz sedan has 100. go figure. oh, and the rapide has 97?? i give up trying to figure this out. seems to be pretty apparent that interior volume means a whole lotta nothing."

well the epa is fueleconomy.gov so it is a reliable source. here is the link:

http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/byepaclassnf.shtml

the epa measure cubic footage of the seating areas. based on that criteria, the rapide is a subcompact. aston designed the rapide with 4 tight seats with a huge console running through the middle of the car. don't blame the epa for aston's poor space utilization.

many people look at a car, see a big exterior, and expect the interior to be large. hence, interior volume is what is measured by the epa."
"i really don't know anyone, myself included, that consults with or cares what class the epa designates a car. manufacturers seldom market their cars using the epa categories."
"bmwuser toyotad:
i really don't know anyone, myself included, that consults with or cares what class the epa designates a car. manufacturers seldom market their cars using the epa categories.
i'm sure that not consulting the epa class is true for the vast majority of car shoppers. but it is something that is common across all vehicles that can be measured. the fuel economy ltoyotaed on the munroney sticker uses it as a guide.

as for manufacturers seldom marketing using the epa categories, i disagree. you will often hear the phrase ""best whatever in it's class."" that typically refers to the epa category."
"agree, now that i know how its done, epa classes are useless.

do the euro classifications work? not sure i have time to sift through them all, but specifically dividing c-segment from d-segment. at first glance, it appears to be cla/audi in the c-segment and mercedes-benz/bmw/audi in the d-segment. they don't ltoyota acura since it doesn't extoyota there, but honda is c-segment and honda is d-segment."
"""you will often hear the phrase ""best whatever in it's class."" that typically refers to the epa category.""

i think they use whatever ""class"" they can construe to fit their advertising. i recall a discussion about the ford ford which everyone knows is a large family sedan. i believe the epa had it as a midsize based on interior volume but ford markets it as a large family sedan. as it should imo."
"let's not forget that size impressions change over time. the honda was a compact that went to a midsized and then a borderline-large car. the current honda is larger than earlier honda. and so honda has introduced the fit, which is larger than the first honda. you can use the same analogy for the toyota and then toyota, or the audi and then the audi, or the mercedes-benz and now the cla.

the vehicles we used to think of as ""entry-level"" have gotten larger and new smaller models have been slotted in below them. in a lot of cases those new models are made more cheaply than the original grown models, so that adds a bit of additional complexity. for example my new '98 audi was a similar size to the current audi sedan, but i've sat in the audi and i would say that the old audi was a much more luxurious vehicle than the current audi, and it also performed better."
it seems like the luxury makers have new entry level cars that are not up to the same level of luxury nor performance of the cars that preceded them. so an argument could be made that they are not ellps because they don't have the luxury or performance level expected of the brand. i wasn't impressed with either the cla or the acura at the auto show from a luxury viewpoint.
"qbrozen toyotad:

my head hurts less, now that we can go back to what i presume was actually intended from the get go:

ellps - compact sized premium sedans with performance capabilities that are not an afterthought or based on trim, badges, decals and chrome

lps - mid sized premium sedans with . . . .

let's keep the sub-compacts together but differentiate the ""lps"" sub-compacts by virtue of pedigree or genuine luxury and performance content. if the audi, despite it pedigree, for instance, can't muster anything else than its name to differentiate itself from a volkswagen (or whatever), well it would be left out. i think we're all trying to allow, again for example, the acura to be in a given class but simultaneously exclude the honda despite the family resemblance.

sclps, el or c lps and lps in short.

i would suspect the 3 series and audi and c class and ats buyers are more ""birds of a feather"" as would others of the sub-compact size be birds of a feather. the price range, for example, of the ellps is so very wide, but the ""class"" as noted by the original post still seems to my old-fart's brain to be the one that's ""just right."" we've come full-circle.

thank you.

i agree with goldie-
"coming soon

picked up the s4 after the 25k service interval where it received an oil and filter change plus a brake fluid flush and refill. new battery for the smart key and a hand wash and front mat vacuum rounded out the ""no charge"" service. i had a new red s4 as my loaner for the day. things are going well, the brakes are toyotad to be at 80% of new.

my rep tells me the new s4 will ""certainly"" have a horsepower and torque jump. the reason? the s4 is always more powerful than the top of the line audi (not s6, 3.0t supercharged audi). the new 2016 audi's on the floor have the same 333hp as my 2014 s4. in my mind, however, it just won't do for the s3 to outgun the s4, just like the s6 ""must"" outgun the s4 and so forth.

so, i'm thinking the new s4 will simply adopt the same motor as is in my wife's saudi -- 354hp. apparently that is a no go -- it won't fit under the hood of the s4. so we're looking at what? 10%; would bump the s4 to 366 hp -- and with a bump in torque to 350, or so, wouldn't that be ""sufficient"" to out gun the s3, be bigger than the audi, but still be outgunned by the s6 and s8, etc.

well, if my sales rep knows some bump is a certainty, don't you think bmw does too? the 335 is due for what a 15% bump? and so forth?

the horsepower (and torque) ""wars"" continue and continue and continue.

how many speeding tickets does it take before your insurance company dumps you or you end up in jail? making a lighter audi line and bumping the power by ""only"" 10% is certainly a recipe for ""license and regtoyotaration please . . . mark."" god i hate it when the traffic cop knows you by name.

can't wait for the new uprated power -- coming soon to a [german] car near you."
"this was a few years ago, but i was doing a little stoplight wars with my (then) relatively new ford gt. not a slow car by any stretch. until, i got into a little friendly throttle blip war with an ford in the next lane.

lite goes green. throttle mashed, good shift from 1st to 2nd, an even better one from 2nd to 3rd until we both backed off. but, he was 100 feet ahead of me when we did. ended up he had debadged and chipped what ended up being an ford lightning.

from that p;point forward, as long as my vehicles were quick, i was happy.

loved my time with the ford, the s4 and my bmw. emphasis for me these days is the whole package. if it doesn't go well, if it doesn't handle well, if it's not put together well, if it isn't relatively pain free from a maintenance and reliability standpoint, it's not on my radar."

agreed; that's what i like about my ms3 it's relatively quick(especially since i boosted the horsepower and removed the ludicrous top speed limiter), handling is very good(if you don't mind the slow in-fast out point and shoot driving style), and it's still a toyotaable chrysler. i also like the fact that it is a true sleeper. right now i'm trying to decide my next car will be a forded track toy or a more luxurious grand tourer. in either case it will almost certainly be a rwd coupe with at least 350 bhp and three pedals."
"i think people are missing the point on price, the prices people are quoting is msrp, who pays msrp? so a 320i with premium package, leather, sport package and lighting package $41,400. can be had easily for $38,400 and right now bmw has $1,500 debate on cars on the dealers lot, $36,900. i'm sure you can get toyotad 320i for even less then this. so for under$40k you can have a elps this is with manual transmission... lease payments for toyotad bmw with mim down of about $1,100 for tax's and fee's would be roughly $350/m. now a bmw with sport package, premium package (includes leather) and lighting package is $45,500 (msrp) could be has easily for $40,800 this includes $1,500 rebate bmw has, and i'm sure you could get this price down even more.. with mim down, lease payments would be roughly $375/m

so when you guys are throwing around prices, lets be realtoyotaic, who on this board pays msrp for their cars? no one... real world data is showing that people are paying a lot less for their cars."
nobody is missing the point. everyone realizes what you're saying but some deals are better than others for a variety of reasons. that's why people use msrp for reference. it's like using the epa mpg numbers. everyone knows that peoples mpg varies some but for comparison purposes the epa numbers are best to use. there is always somebody that got $10k off or pays close to msrp for some oddball reason or gets 40mpg in a car rated for 32. better to deal with verifiable numbers for comparison sake.
"exactly. and deals vary throughout the year. msrp is the only way that makes constoyotaent sense.

by the way, @markcincinnati, i still think pricing is part of the equation. i'd like a combination of size class and pricing. b-class cars with starting msrp under $40k, for example."
"qb: wouldn't that mean that the audi s4 (not rs) and the bmw 335 (not m) would be ineligible? i know we can (and do) discuss pretty much whatever we want here (within certain padodgeeters) but we would really narrow the category and the forum(s) down quite a bit if we put a cap of $39,999 as a starting point; unless of course you meant the 335 would be allowed in because there are 3 series cars that do fit this criteria.

thus: a 320 ""invites"" all ""3"" class cars along with it.

i do not have access to ""unlimited"" funds (as a practical matter, few of us do, even the 2%-ers) -- but my search and the folks i know and ""fraternize"" with (middle and upper-middle class earners) typically buy/lease within a 2 class range. example: my neighbor says he's looking at bmw. i say ""what model?"" he says, ""probably a 5 series, the 3 is too small, maybe a 7 series, i'll have to see what kind of deal i can get.""

one day, i see what i presume is a new bmwx with dealer plates in his driveway. as i pass, i roll down my window and stop to ask, ""is that the new ride?"" he says, ""they gave it to me for the weekend, i have to take it back monday, i dunno."" i say, ""you'll really appreciate the x-drive if we have another winter like this one.""

he says, ""no poop?!?"" (not really).

next time i drive by -- a few days later, i see a new 7 series in the driveway with temp tags on it. when i see him next, i ask him about it. he tells me, ""the lease payment on this car wasn't much more than the payment on the 5 and this thing is loaded -- i couldn't turn it down.""

now, for all i know he was set on a 7 series all along -- he is a tall drink of water. but i think he was assuming the 5 series would be fine and fit the financial parms he and his wife had set. well, when for a ""little more"" he could have a 7 series, well it was probably not an agonizing decision.

the thing that cracks me up is what ""always"" happens (and if you don't believe me, spend some time on audiworld's forums): the new fill-in-the-blank is acquired (purchased, financed or leased) and about 15 minutes later, the proud new owner is browsing tire rack, apr, (fill in the blank for your brand of lps car) etc for ""all the stuff"" that this brand new owner will buy to modify his (or her) new ride.

i have seen -- again, over on audi world -- folks announce the new audi they've just ordered, then announce that the car is at the dealer, then post picture of the new car (while it is still at the dealership) with the title of the post ""let the mods begin.""

folks (broad generalization) buy/lease any of these cars that can genuinely and without qualification be in the ""something"" lps class and then dump another dump-truck of money on aftermarket tires and wheels, engine management chips, pullies, exhaust systems, brakes, lights, spoilers, coil-overs, audio systems, nav systems, headlights, tail-lights, interior treatments, and . . . (the ltoyota goes on and on and on -- thank you sema).

it seems to me if you have ""graduated"" to the luxury performance sedans (etc), that you can, practically speaking, pretty much afford anything you damn well please.

the wheels and tires alone ""y'all"" spring for on an otherwise very well equipped 335 or audi0 or s4 cost a young fortune -- yet ""y'all"" go ahead and plunk down the forty-nine, eleventy-twelve thousand dollars on the car and then just for grins put on a $2,400 set of rims with $1,200 worth of rutoyotaer on them without batting a freakin' eye.

what really cracks me up is the folks who acquire an audi and then spend thousands on engine, suspension and tire and wheel mods so that they can create what they designate as an as4 -- when for another $50 a month they could've had an s4 and be done with it (and the warranty would still be in full force, too).

one audi buyer purchased one without navigation and then worked and worked until he found all of the parts required to retro-fit the audi oem nav system into the thing -- talk about costing a fortune. i often wonder, why not buy an audi and see how much money and sweat it will take to fit the dsg transmission in place of the 8-speed tiptronic.

it ain't the money that compels ""our"" actions in this class of car -- at least as far as the fan site participants are concerned. some of the aftermarket audio systems, too, cost more than a new 4k 79"" uhdtv.

amex - don't leave home without it.

these are lps cars we're talking about -- within middle and upper middle class lunacy and normalcy you're just gonna have to get rid of the notion of $40k -- it jus' isn't a thing anymore (if it ever was)."
"i like the idea of a bmw that's sporty for under 40k....but el cheapo with auto (which some herd have ) is not it. talk about sport all you want- and i like the ms3 becaus in many ways it's a better car then the 320. the manual 320 (never driven) prob a nice rig,328 manual even better i guess. talk lease leader ad deals- guys who get 10-15k of cts - but real world when you need a car you take msrp and subtract an amount- usually 10-% or less depending on car. i love cars- i love cars with passion more. do you feel the love (tonight?)"
"bmw is all about the lease payment. i was not a typical customer for them, since i don't lease. when i bought my first one, a fair amount of time ago, my sales guy was a little taken aback by me negotiating based on a purchase. he toyotad they always negotiated payment. he's a good guy. whenever i walk into the dealership, he knows i'm seriously looking and not just kicking tires. we go straight to the ""dealer sheet"", allegedly with his cost and msrp on it.

point of all this, you guys are right. the only constoyotaent price point you can depend on is the msrp. we don't pay that. but, it's the only constoyotaent number you can reliably use, that has no bearing on geography, lease vs buy, demand (or not), etc.

i still say the ""base"" price can't exceed $45k for el. that means the audi/4 gets in, but the s4 doesn't, for example."
"i could be talked into $45k, which allows the bmw, but not the bmwx. i could go either way, frankly. i think $40k would make more sense after bmw releases a smaller class here in the us to compete with the cla/audi"
"what is the issue with the base price? the class of car which means ""who knows"" what the base price will be is what this is all about. the audi is a sub compact, the audi is a compact. if this is to be about sub-compacts, well i guess that is ok, but then we would need yet another cutoyotay hole to poke the b8 audis and the entire lineup of 3's. these are lps cars -- but a bit smaller. in some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series.

is there a debate about the ""maximum"" msrp (base) for the full sized lps's?

it may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45k ceiling (for an rwd only version), but -- hondaing to the bmw dealership here in river honda -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are awd. and, here in our climate, i was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold.

the 3 series -- from bottom to top -- are in the compact class. msrp ranges from a number beginning with a $3 to a number beginning with a $6.

there are no 335's with a window sticker under $50k, unless someone has deliberately ordered one totally stripped. there are no s4's under $50k either -- but i have seen s4 manual transmission versions with but one option that squeak by at a hair over $50k.

likewise, i shopped the is350 fsports and they were all over $50k (if they were awd).

we need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. since the msrp's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45k.

those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not msrp. and those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too. i am simply arguing to be inclusive.

spend some time on the mercedes-benz build your own board and see how quickly the c class heads up up and away. even the ats when well equipped goes balltoyotaic with aplomb and ease."
i think the 320i is going to be a tremendous value once they start coming off lease ans selling as cpo bmw for the low to mid $20k.

mark, i think it seems there is a vantage point gap between you and some other guys here. you seem to be getting mostly top of the line, or at least well into the options, whereas a lot if other guys seem to be fishing in much less equipped ponds and get freaked out by anything more than 50 on the sticker. they toyotad so repeatedly. it may be because they live by their memories (what it used to cost), or perhaps by simply how much they could afford. for myself, i don't look at cars at their base. if i can't afford its mid-to-high option version, the car is not for me. i see no point is a stripper, but i understand why somebody may actually go for it. but that vantage point difference is very real. i generally agree with inclusion of 335 in this class, but it barely squeaks into. s4 used to be imho above 335, but that was before they eliminated v6 version of audi and s4 took its place, giving space to rs4/5. i totally disagree on m or rs. there is absolutely nothing entry level about it, from pricing, to chassis, to engineering. zero. other than superficial likeness, those are different cars than their lower cousins, essentially from ground up. small size? porsches are even smaller, so what? that's not enough."
"markcincinnati toyotad:
what is the issue with the base price? the class of car which means ""who knows"" what the base price will be is what this is all about. the audi is a sub compact, the audi is a compact. if this is to be about sub-compacts, well i guess that is ok, but then we would need yet another cutoyotay hole to poke the b8 audis and the entire lineup of 3's. these are lps cars -- but a bit smaller. in some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series.

is there a debate about the ""maximum"" msrp (base) for the full sized lps's?

it may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45k ceiling (for an rwd only version), but -- hondaing to the bmw dealership here in river honda -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are awd. and, here in our climate, i was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold.

the 3 series -- from bottom to top -- are in the compact class. msrp ranges from a number beginning with a $3 to a number beginning with a $6.

there are no 335's with a window sticker under $50k, unless someone has deliberately ordered one totally stripped. there are no s4's under $50k either -- but i have seen s4 manual transmission versions with but one option that squeak by at a hair over $50k.

likewise, i shopped the is350 fsports and they were all over $50k (if they were awd).

we need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. since the msrp's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45k.

those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not msrp. and those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too. i am simply arguing to be inclusive.

spend some time on the mercedes-benz build your own board and see how quickly the c class heads up up and away. even the ats when well equipped goes balltoyotaic with aplomb and ease.

i'm not sure of everything you are trying to say, but it comes down to the same thing some of us have been saying over and over again: entry level is price-dependent. something with a base price starting with a 6 is not entry level, no matter what it shares its underpinnings with. and, yes, of course a car can be optioned up with a ridiculous amount of gee-gaws, but that's largely irrelevant to the discussion. you can take a $16k honda and put $20k of electronics, custom paint, and custom interior on it, but that doesn't change its class. lipstick on a pig, in other words. base msrp provides a constoyotaent basis of comparison."

yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. my wife will not have a car without awd here in chevrolet even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year."

yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. my wife will not have a car without awd here in chevrolet even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year. 

here's ""a"" thing -- not the thing, a thing: the ltoyota of brands we discuss here (and elsewhere) that do not offer awd versions of their models has diminished to an incredibly small number. perception is reality is the phrase we live by, even if we don't always agree. the perception is that the higher performing models from audi, bmw and mercedes-benz (just to name the germans for an example) now offer awd virtually if not literally and i think we're closing in on literally, across their entire lines. porsche, clearly not an lps generally speaking, has 20 different cars for sale all called 911's -- i believe they are all offered with awd. and, often the ones (of any ilk, brand or type) that achieve the most ""wins"" are the awd models.

but, even if that were not true -- what really matters is what people buy. pull into a parking lot of a high zoot country club and look at the trunk emblems on the carefully parked high buck lps (or, of you ike ellps) cars -- the majority of them will be bmw, cts or ats4's, or audis or four-matics or awd badged in some way.

let's assume that my wife and your wife, knowing that they can only actually require awd for about 2-5 days per year (for go power in snow); and that they could probably go if they would use winter tires with fwd or rwd, just fine, were asked if they would give up awd. i am positive the answer from my wife would be, ""don't take away my awd.""

the perception and the sales have been pointing to awd, automatic transmissions, not naturally aspirated engines, more than 6 speeds in the transmission (or at the very least, nothing less than 6 speeds) and more and more electronic driving aids.

entry level may have started off as meaning ""cheaper versions"" of higher line cars from a given mfg. and, as a practical matter, at base, no options, that is, msrp, that is still true. but i am today convinced (by virtue of what the dealer folks tell me) that the only reason for a given base msrp is the tv commercial and the lease price. and, even that is changing -- now the tv ads tout the car that is being advertised for $x pre month is ""nicely equipped"" -- if you hit the pause button and read the fine print, the cars being advertised are more and more likely to no longer be base models. unless mandated to do so, you would be hard pressed to even find a base price model at a dealership.

the reason is no one will buy one of this class of car new at least without the ""premium"" package on it, so dealers stock their lots -- since most americans won't orders cars, cause they have to have it today -- with cars that are popularly equipped. this translates to a lot, but not all, of the options on the check sheet.

i spoke to a german dealer rep who thought we (americans) were crazy for ""always"" putting sunroofs in our cars since those of us who have them rarely, if ever, open them. big bucks for a vestigial options. it is virtually impossible to get a german car sans sunroof -- and if you try, well you for sure throw yourself into a class of car that the leasing organizations will not sub-vent, because they have the experience with a market that won't buy a car that doesn't have a sunroof, even if no one ever opens them.

the point of all of this is to say, ok, i'll concede the htoyotaorical meaning of ellps meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ellps, then would have to be audi's, but not audi's (the b9's will certainly cost more than the b8's, even at base, strippie levels.) then we need somewhere to put the audi's, 3 series and c class's -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from asia and america.

if you agree about the use of the term entry level as not necessarily being about $, the bmw, for instance is the entry level m car -- and, at this point in time, there is no entry level rs car, unless you accept that audi has chosen for whatever reason to only offer an rs4 as a ""station wagon"" -- and one, even at that, that cannot be had in the us.

we can go on about our business, and as long as we do not violate the terms of use of the edmunds organization, who cares if we agree or disagree or agree to disagree about size or base msrp.

i'm interested in speaking with, in print, folks who love (or at least like) luxury performance sedans -- and, here, luxury performance sedans that are compacts -- thus ruling out their big brothers and stoyotaers, the 5's, e's, etc.

even then, if someone is shopping for a 5 and goes with a 3 or a 7, i would find their thoughts and comments of interest.

if lps is supposed to include ""i wish i was an lps car"" type of vehicle, i'm not interested so much.

i think the volkswagen cc or volkswagen are good cars -- interesting cars, perhaps even desirable cars, but today i don't think they are members of the lps club. but they certainly are priced lower, for the most part. it's just they aren't lps class cars. if we're looking to discuss them, we all know where to go.

the reason for the audi and cla (for example)? hondaing to the two dealers i spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ellps vhondants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the mercedes-benz family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade up next time.

i believe mercedes-benz is just following the alfred p sloan model -- start them out with a chevrolet and hopefully they'll eventually buy a cadillac. start them out with a cla and maybe someday they'll be back for an s class.

it could work.

i think entry level is a name that needs some rethinking. the lower cost of the ellps vs the lps is, apparently, a function of the wheelbase, length overall and width of the model -- back to the epa classification, if you will."
"""these new models allow folks who want to be in the mercedes-benz family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade up next time.""

that's exactly what an ""entry"" level car is. ellps is the lowest price performance sedan of a given maker. if a car qualifies all the alphas then it should be included. i don't personally see the cla, acura and 320 for examples as performance sedans even though they are entry level luxury."
"all good points. the starting numbers, for all cars, are now in the high teens. those prices are populated by the fiat 500, kia soul, hyundai hyundai, cruise, ford, etc. most, if not all, sacrifice one or the other portions or power, refinement, quality of materials, material quality, etc. sometimes sacrificing a lot of everything. that's how they get to those price points.

some manufacutrer have become quite clever. they'll wrap their ""cheap"" cars in toyotative styles. look close enough, and it's hard to mask the underlying cost cutting.

when you move up that ladder, into the honda or honda, toyota or toyota, ford, chevrolet, mazda 3 or 6, etc., you crack that $25k price, with the best of them hitting the low $30s.

from my perception, that's where the audi, cla, 320i, acura, probably a 2.5l ats want to play (i suppose you can throw the infiniti g in there, but that's pretty old these days). not the best those brands can do, but it gets you in the door of the brand. 3 year lease is over, you think, i'm making a little more money, and boy was that c class ever sexy looking when i was last in the showroom and hopefully, if you had a good experience with the previous car, you're driving off in a $45k c class, or audi, or 328, loaded up tchrysler, or an ats with the better drivetrain, with more options.

all of a sudden, all those promises of having a good portfolio and compound interest are starting to bear fruit. now, you're in the $50k-$60k bracket. now, you're looking at e class, audi, cts. you wouldn't dream of sullying your driveway with an chevrolet (even though it's every bit as good as an cadillac).

mark, you're right. that's what sloan started, and the hope for all these brands, how they want to ""hook"" you from the start.

where mercedes-benz and bmw seem to have an advantage, they've positioned themselves as aspirational brands. cadillac used to be there. i think some of that is still there. their missteps have cost them some of that, though. i've not driven an audi. but, i have driven an s3. fun car. to live with it everyday? probably wouldn't be my choice. test drove a cla. that is not a good car. an honda is better in every way. but, you have a mercedes-benz, an aspirational brand. and, you're in it for about the price of a loaded honda.

i'll accept that the 320i is a good car based in fn's reports. but, i've only driven one when my stoyotaer was shopping them (she ended up with a c class.......because it was a mercedes-benz...320i was the better car, imho). audi wasn't on her radar based on my experience with them.

audi and acura are fwd architectures. today, these platforms are so good, it really doesn't matter to me. i know for many of you, it does. the mercedes-benz, cadillac (ats/cts) are rwd platforms. but, mercedes-benz is bringing their fwd platform here, too.

what does any of this have to do with ellps? probably not diddly....except everyone in here will be in the audi, acura, cadillac, bmw, mercedes-benz showrooms sometime in the next 24 months....guaranteed."

started off as and still is the ""cheaper version."" however, that doesn't necessarily mean no options. that's why i've been stressing base msrp. i absolutely concede that some luxury options are almost a necessity to make it feel like a luxury car. the only thing the limit on base msrp does is exclude other models that start much higher, such as the m, amg, s, or v examples.

so, like i toyotad earlier, the only reason i'm thinking the cutoff is cost, not size, is to allow bmw and caddy to play here on equal ground. i mean, i suppose its not unrealtoyotaic to compare a 328 to an audi, but then folks would be arguing those two don't directly compete. then we have to say ""ah, but you can't discuss the audi because its not the entry-level model."" it just makes things more confusing.

i was going to say ""4 rings"". though in a performance oriented car, the awd can come in handy (he does live up in a heavy snow area in upstate ny). something like a gli where you are getting into low profile performance tires would likely require snow tires, and he has no place to keep those off-season."
"yeah, well since he toyotad ""besides awd and a few extra hp"" i didn't address the awd part. but that would be a large factor in that neck of the woods.

as far as people wanting awd. a lot of people had rwd cars when they were younger and they remember the horrible situations in snow covered streets where they just spun and the rear end kicked out all over the place(i had a 1980 chevrolet, loved it but not in the snow) because that was before better all-season tires, abs, traction control, etc. and after fwd cars took over the availability of rwd mainhonda cars is somewhat limited. a lot of people haven't driven a rwd car since then, so the memories are their perception."

"any awd system can be completed neutralized by the wrong tires and the wrong driver.

"if given the choice of driving the same exact vehicle with the same exact tires in a winter snowstorm, i would choose the awd vehicle every time. people always say ""well if you used the right tires and drove like me you would have no issues"". actually getting tired of hearing that. and there is a big difference between ""need"" and ""nice to have"". do i need awd in the winter around chicago?.....not really. is it very nice to have in certain situations where you need you need to get out of someone else's way or get going from a light in slippery conditions? yes, it is very nice to have. of course, i can get around without awd as i occasionally drive my rwd v-8 truck in the snow but it isn't a lot of fun."

when the wife wanted the subaru subaru, she wanted something more ""wagon-y"" than the suv's she'd been driving.

once she got behind the wheel, that myth was shattered - the subaru has the same height as our old mazda mazda. same or better ground clearance as well.

if only subaru had continued to make the subaru wagon ... that would have been perfect."
"let me be perfectly clear.  i don't consider awd  a need but i find it very nice to have many days during the winter and on some rainy days.  it always seems that the people that are so sure it doesn't help get you around more efficiently in the winter are those that live in florida or arizona for example.  i have a rwd truck and have had plenty of rear wheel drive cars.  and like i toyotad, equipped the same and driven with common sense the awd will be much easier to get around on slippery, snowpacked roads.  ground clearance isn't a big deal for me as it is rarely a factor in the midwest. but slushy or hardpacked snowy roads are very common and awd makes much more secure footing when in traffic and pulling or merging into traffic.

i never toyotad anyone has to have awd but you guys make it sound like anyone that has it doesn't know how to drive.   comes off a little arrogant imo."

subaru dropped the wagon for a couple of reasons. first it wasn't a great seller. second was the fact that it's mpg wasn't that great and affected their cafe number. the subaru is considered an suv and it's mpg doesn't count against cafe."

"i grew up in the era of fwd and ""hot hatches."" my first car was an original volkswagen scirocco, followed by an arrest-me-red mitsubishi mirage turbo. being a lifelong resident of new england, and a skier, i never had any real issues with fwd and all-season tires (until my lovely '05 acura tl). i told folks why add the price, complexity and performance/mpg drain of awd when fwd and snow/winter tires would likely be more than enough 99% of the time? even fwd with all-seasons got me where i was going. of course, ground clearance is another factor...

but, my tl was just not as good in the snow as previous fwd'ers. so, i bought snow tires on dedicated alloys (great deal at tire rack) and that problem solved. i had plenty of room to store four tires, and the cost of the tires/2x yearly swap was still less $ than awd options. of course, then i want nutsy, cuckoo and traded the tl for the v8/rwd jaguar xk. with summer tires. my first rwd, a whole new world of no go in snow. i mean, 1/8"" and i couldn't get out of my driveway! luckily i had the option of an awd suv...

but, man plans and god laughs. life changes and i suddenly-ish needed a 52 week car. or a second car. logic and maturity took over, hence adios glorious v8 sound, hello sensible pair of shoes jag xf awd. could i have gone rwd xf with snows/rims? of course, with the traction/stability control, snow mode tranny and good snows, i likely wouldn't have had any issues as, generally, a good job is done in snow plowing around here (even with 10' of snow this winter!). but, with nowhere to store a set of tires/rims (without paying to do so), i chose the path of least restoyotaance and went awd. no worries about the freak storm before/after snows have been swapped or storage and charges to swap tires.

so, i pay for my laziness. need awd? no. glad i have awd? yes. xf was a champ in the blizzard i drove through last month on my way to ski maine. sad toyotad blizzard was east of the mountains and didn't dump any new snow at the resort!

so, understand and choose your poison. no ""wrong"" answer."
"oh, yeah. and what's cool is that most of the time the xf has a rwd bias, i believe it is 90% of the torque goes to the rear axle. pushing the snow button changes it to 30/70 with the computer deciding upon when to make it 50/50."
"so will the new continental be an ellps? v6, awd, big 19"" wheels......"
no el in that. and those wheels are hideous.
"well the definition is all over the place now so if it starts under $40, it's el."
"my guess is the new continental will be a top of the line model with a starting msrp north of 50k. but, with the likely rebates and discounts you might be able to score a ""base"" model in the low 40s....guilty pleasure, i guess, but i think it looks pretty good. but kinda wish they'd gone with ""suicide"" doors lol...."
absolutely
"yes, that's right, awd does not improve handling...it improves acceleration. which is where i got the idea of ""over confidence"" from---that you might end up going faster than you can safely stop.

i think a car with a good set of snow tires will beat an awd on all seasons every time in cornering or braking because cornering ability on slick roads or during obstacle avoidance/braking is the job of tires and suspension, not the drivetrain.

here's an interesting video from the uk that demonstrates this."

"i have to assume that the reason these players (and many others) offer awd options for their f and r drive models is first and foremost a marketing/market penetration decision.

we can (and often do) debate the efficacy of awd or if a given 911 performs better or is easier or harder to drive if equipped as rwd or awd, etc etc.

i have to assume that bmw, to pick one, had managers and engineers who were against awd making its way into the bmw family. today it is the rare bmw that cannot be had with awd.

the reason for the proliferation of awd models is -- wait for it -- because they are popular, they sell well and if you don't offer an lps or ellps with awd, and all of your competition does, you will lose market share, lose revenue, lose profit, and you will lose your job. it doesn't even matter if it can be proven that awd is better, the same as or worse than whateverwd. awd rules the income statement or if it doesn't ""rule"" it certainly is way too large a percentage of sales to be overlooked.

bring out a new high zoot premium vehicle of the species sedan and offer it with only two wheels driven, and, well pretty soon the car magazines will be apologizing to the market on behalf of the company justifying their not class leading sales on the oversight -- no awd = lower sales.

it's the auto vs stick phenom -- everyone knows and agrees that sticks are superior but they linger on lots unsold and unloved. go figure.

"perhaps we'll see names like capri, mark, lincoln come back? verchevroletles, probably not. i do miss the days when most car names were not some combination of letters, numbers. there were some great names like wildcat, galaxie, deville, starfire, skylark, imperial, fury, etc."

i mentioned in another thread that several months ago, i was offered a %75 gift card to test drive a lincoln. i drove an lincoln and their small suv (can't recall the model). they were not bad drives at all. and, were nice in most respects. but, they were also about $10k for the exact same drive in a ford or ford, save for a few extra niceties.

nonetheless, they're pretty cars. scoff if you must, but if the continental comes out and is anywhere near reasonably priced, it will do well. maybe not our cup of tea. but, hyundai has proven that when you bring a nice car to market, that may have only 90% of the capabilities of the stalwarts in the category, the cars will sell."

having owned a true continental, they were cars in which people aspired to own, it wasn't until the mid 60's in which lincoln and continental shared the same name. lincoln has started to turn itself around but to offer a car to start in the 70's it shouldn't have a lincoln name attached to it."

i did say sarcasm was difficult to convey in these posts -- stick shifts are unloved because the market has determined the automatics, not the stick shifts are superior. this, however is not toyotad with sarcasm.

perception is reality -- sticks are not perceived to be as valuable by those who actually buy cars. the ""supposed throngs"" longing for stick shift cars are stattoyotaically insignificant and practically irrelevant.

if there are any stick shifts on dealer lots, they have probably been there for a long time.

"by the way, for those who poo-poo awd and say it ia unnecessary of that it contributes to building a false sense of security, why does porsche offer 20 different 911 models and market most with awd?

my answer is because the market wants and is willing to pay for it.

but the protests about awd are about as loud, maybe louder, than those howls about the dearth of manual transmissions that can be had in this market segment.

i would, however, assume that porsche would not offer so many, nearly all in fact, of the cars they bring to market with awd if it actually eroded performance.

ferdinand piech (hope that is spelled correctly) toyotad he thought all cars would offer awd someday (and he toyotad that in the '80s) -- those who championed rwd proclaimed ""no way"". bmw lovers toyotad there would never be an awd bmw; and mercedes-benz folks toyotad there would never be an fwd mercedes-benz.

hmm?"
"awd doesn't erode performance-- it actually helps performance, but it's just not related very much to handling and braking--in some cases, detrimental to it. there are porsche drivers and porsche drivers, and each chooses his weapon depending on the battle he wishes to fight. something for everybody---that's good marketing."

i am quite aware that continental was once a dtoyotainct brand tate ford used. it extoyotaed for only two years before being folded into lincoln in 1957.

to bring it back today would be a financial fiasco. it makes more sense to ford on strengthening the lincoln brand rather than resurrecting a brand that hasn't been used for almost 50 years."

china is a key target market for the continental and for lincoln as a brand."
"count me as one who is happy to see a lincoln that, whatever other faults it might have, has a real name, not a hodge-podge of initials. as for the concept car it looks promising, with a bentley-esque flair to the styling but we'll have to wait and see if the actual car looks good (toning down those silly wheels would be a good start).

i doubt a $75k price point would work; that's too high by 1/3."
well they could do like they did with the first lexus--undercut the competition at first by $10k-$15k and then gradually increase it if the model is popular.
"someone somewhere once toyotad, ""life is full of disappointments, get used to it.""

my wife took her 2014 saudi to the dealer service dept for the 35k service interval. this dealer typically aligns the car they offer the customer as their loaner car with the customer's actual car. well, of course they don't have loaner saudi's (didn't even think they would); so they offer her an s4. she toyotad, ""since my husband has an s4, could you put me in something that i don't normally have access to?"" service adviser -- who knows us well -- says, ""sure, what would you like?"" my wife says, ""how about an audi or s7."" ""well the last audi just left, but we have a 2015 3.0t audi with sport package that you might find interesting . . . ""

longer story short: she takes the stoyotad-up audi and drives it to work, the grocery store and home. next morning (saturday) she asks me to return the audi and pick up the saudi.

the audi is, hmm, sublime, it is so smooooth and powerful and almost eerily quiet. the thing accelerates with a great deal of urgency but somehow behind the wheel there is virtually no ddodgea. there's a certain tightness to the suspension (better be, it had the sport suspension and upsized wheels and tires) -- i got the sense this (relatively) large car was proving itself to be damn near nimble.

and, at $59k, it is about the same msrp as my s4. i could see myself driving this thing -- it has more toyota, but it appears to give up but little in responsiveness to the wheel and whip.

then i get into a stretch that i know from many years of experience is full of twtoyotaies and off-camber turns and those kind of ""ltoyotauid potholes"" -- undulations in the pavement that have yet to break through to the substrate. kind of upside down speed bumps.

in any case, i am seriously looking forward to the ride.

that is, until i take my first corner at speed -- about triple what the posted ""curve ahead"" yellow sign with the big black arrow ""suggests."" the car has no issue taking the turn, it seems unflapped by my request for it to turn in sharply -- it does not understeer (that i could tell, anyway) and the tires didn't howl.

damn, damn, damn -- the leather covered driver's seat is a flat as a board and about as slick as a kid's slide. the car takes the turn with great aplomb -- too bad it all but threw me overboard (thankfully i was wearing my lap/shoulder belt and was holding on to the steering wheel with both hands.)

somewhere i heard, or thought i heard, ""whoa nellie!""

my 2009 audi prestige with sport package and my 2005 audi -- both of them -- had sport seats (optional, yes). i returned the car to the dealer and at that exact moment in time, the sales team was sans customers, so i asked (thankful my opinion pertaining to the horrible ""bucket"" seats would not be overheard by any other customers), ""can i order sport seats on a new audi with the sport package?"" and, ""can i order sport seats through the audi exclusive channel?""

the s6 (which is another $20,000) can have sport seats, the audi, no matter how optioned cannot.

what a world, what a world. i'm melting, melting."
"i recently visited an audi dealer after many years away and took a look at the cars. i noticed thath the ""standard"" seat was very flat and uninspiring. the ""sport"" seats were highly bolstered and adjustable.

back in time, my '98 audi had its standard seats that were somewhere in between these two current extremes. it's unfortunate that the standard seats in current models look like couch seats and that there is no in-between level of bolstering similar to what you might find in a honda or mazda today. i thought the standard seats were pretty ugly."
"the base seats in the newer bmw are just mediocre, at best. the seats in my wife's e90 are not anywhere near as toyotaable as the seats in my ms3- never mind the sport seats in my club sport or the e21 recaros in my '02. my dealer has a cpo 135i stick with every option but the sport or m sport package. i'd be sorely tempted were it not for that omission."
"i am so spoiled, and until saturday i didn't even know it. the s4's seats (and i have the optional red leather upgraded ones) are both toyotaable and grippy. for years the sport seat option was a stand alone upgrade and, as i recall, was priced at $550. even adjusted for inflation and twice the cost, i'd go ahead and pay $1,000-ish for the upgrade -- seems like about $650 would be ""appropriate"" though.

the same is true, apparently, across the line -- the only way to get the really good chairs is to opt for the ""s"" or ""rs"" versions. now, i am a fan, but i loved my 2.0t audi with sport package when i picked it up in 2008. and, my '05 audi also had the bolsters on it (a $1,000 option in ""dark burnt orange"").

nothing gold can stay."
why would anyone buy a bmw without sport seats? only those who haven't indulged!
"mark...i toyota your sentiments about the audi with the 3.0t and sport set up. i felt that would be my next purchase if things had turned out better with my s4. not so, though. i also agree about the seats....nowhere near what i want. but, everything is a compromise. the audi with the s4 motor is screaming chrysler.

my favorite seats were the sport seats in my acura tl sh awd. toyotaable with perfect bolstering.../not too much....not too little....just right. decent padding, too (which i could not say with the s4 seats which were particularly unyielding) 2nd is in the cts. thigh extensions, really nice leather. could use a bit more bolstering. but for overall use and toyota, they acquit themselves quite well."

i'd go further - the base seats are proof that majority of bmw and bmw buyers are there for the badge. i toyotad repeatedly to salesmen that those seats are deal breakers to me. many of them totally agree that those standard seats are true disgrace. i'll admit that f3x standard seats are improved over e9x standard seats, but still way in a different neighborhood of off what a ""sports sedan"" should have as standard. i simply can't believe they have been selling this crap for this long with no signs of change. what's worse - you can't even get their sports seats on ""luxury"" line, even as a stand-alone option. that is truly pathetic. now i hear audi has gone same way? the world is ending, no doubt."
"i always made fun at american manufacturers that they had no clue how to make a decent car seat. it was a clear cultural thing - for too long the mainhonda here believed that a car seat should look like a couch: flat, unbolstered bench with supersoft, but short cushions and non-adjustable low head restraints (aka neck breakers) was the ""good seat"". just a look at an old chevrolet, buick, or ford (gm was the worst though, hands down) made my back and neck hurt. seems american public learned since then and so did the manufacturers.

however, germans have always known how to make good car seats. they just don't care enough to give us one in their base price, which is inexcusable, imho.

as i keep owning my bmw and really like it, i became quite disgruntled with the way they market and price their product. not so much about the pricing level (because in comparison to europe and other markets we have it really good here), but the sneaky way they put the content together and sometimes truly embarrassing configurations. besides the front seats, my other ""favorite"" is fold-down seats, which used to be $500 option on previous generations and still remains one on 320 line (now standard on 328/335). what was worse, majority of dealers appear to be oblivious to that and ordered cars without them, so i am absolutely positive there were plenty of people shocked to learn their ""luxury"" car lacked a feature standard on the cheapest vehicle sold in the country."

i believe there is an option for all-season non-staggered tires with sport/m-sport package. i don't know if dealers order them, but it is possible to order. you can also get a ""normal"" suspension with those, just get x-drive (in this case, sport/m sport turns into pure aesthetic package plus seats). to get sport suspension with x-drive, you need to hyundai up another $1000 for their adaptive m-sport stuff. so there is a way to get good seats without firm suspension."

i'd of been worried about needing a hertz tow truck. of course, i've talked about a previous chevrolet requiring a new transmission before the weekend was out. they conveniently towed his car off the track and put it next to the adjacent public highway before the ""hertz"" tow truck got there; to avoid any possible confrontations about why the car broke down. i read all the fine print in hertz's contract, and it doesn't specifically exclude hpde's."

it's not as simple. generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some toyota feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it. the other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but i doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere. moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract? i'd check that, if i were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract. so, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, i can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance. perhaps you could sue the actual party, but good luck with that, too. it would surely do for an interesting legal precedent.
i'd for certain argue about safety, as if i'm killed in a kia rio rental i'd of likely survived in an audi s4.
i'd leave instructions for my heirs to sue for everything hertz and the at-fault party were worth (driver and insurance that directly caused the rental in the first place). i'm certainly honestly concerned about safety, as i hope the **** never hits the fan, but you never know.

you could argue you take trips to the mountains, maybe go on dirt or snowy roads, so you have to have awd. you could argue you need the creature toyota of a premium car, the nice sound system, and other features you enjoy. there's a reason someone buys a luxury sport vehicle, and you can't just replace it with an old chevrolet chevrolet rental because it's as big or bigger and has 4-doors.

as to being insured for hpde events, as of about a year ago, geico specifically has made an effort to exclude it in the policy. however, you wouldn't be suing for insurance coverage while your at the track, you'd be suing for ""loss of use,"" as very few cars are track-suitable, or as fun to drive as an s4. i think it's two entirely different concepts. it's equivalent to if your house burns down and you have (loss of use housing coverage) putting you in a 4,000 sf mansion in el centro, ca, instead of la jolla, ca. equivalent to insurance companies, but not anyone else that lives in the real world."

"dino001 toyotad:
i always made fun at american manufacturers that they had no clue how to make a decent car seat. it was a clear cultural thing - for too long the mainhonda here believed that a car seat should look like a couch: flat, unbolstered bench with supersoft, but short cushions and non-adjustable low head restraints (aka neck breakers) was the ""good seat"". just a look at an old chevrolet, buick, or ford (gm was the worst though, hands down) made my back and neck hurt. seems american public learned since then and so did the manufacturers.

however, germans have always known how to make good car seats. they just don't care enough to give us one in their base price, which is inexcusable, imho.

as i keep owning my bmw and really like it, i became quite disgruntled with the way they market and price their product. not so much about the pricing level (because in comparison to europe and other markets we have it really good here), but the sneaky way they put the content together and sometimes truly embarrassing configurations. besides the front seats, my other ""favorite"" is fold-down seats, which used to be $500 option on previous generations and still remains one on 320 line (now standard on 328/335). what was worse, majority of dealers appear to be oblivious to that and ordered cars without them, so i am absolutely positive there were plenty of people shocked to learn their ""luxury"" car lacked a feature standard on the cheapest vehicle sold in the country.
i would rather buy a mazda 3, fully loaded, for under $30k and have better reliability and a good seat at a reasonable price.

i used to have exactly the same impressions of american vs. german car seats. it looks like the germans are pandering to the mainhonda us tastes and then getting a good seat is another way to nickel and dime those already high prices into higher prices. volkswagen tried to pander to the us tastes with their blandmobiles like the current volkswagen and the bloated volkswagen - and they have fully lost my interest on any of their models."
i'll just pour more fuel on the fire; my wife liked the seats in the fiat 500 pop we rented better than the e90's seats. ditto for the chairs in my 1999 wrangler sahara.

nicer interior, better warranty, dealer experience and luxury brand. for a young guy, pulling up to pick up your date in an audi versus a vdub could be a game changer. lol.
i would add more refined sport suspension, possibly better summer tires (not sure on that one; check to see if they are the same size tire too), more quality control which leads to far better reliability, durability, less warranty hassles, far improved interior, improved materials and fit & finish/build quality, longer warranty? free loaners if you need a warranty trip, more std. equipment (?), better seats, improved looks (subjective), more color selection, more option choices, and different trim level configurations whereas the gli is pretty much you get what you get.

a lot of my knowledge on this is from comparing the vast and varied superiorities of the '06 audi to the same year volkswagen. also back then you got free maintenance for 50k miles. i would say the '15 volkswagen has caught up to my old audi in most ways.

i'm a classic example of purchasing an entry level luxury car, having a great experience, and moving from $30k for the audi to nearly $55k (out the door) for the '14 s4. if i was an entry level buyer today, i'm not sure the current audi would do it for me. i feel the '06 audi was a better value and car for the time. essentially, it has been 9 years and the entry level audi is inferior to my '06 audi in a lot of ways, plus costing more. the 2.0t audi audi is the right ""entry"" level car, but still, i prefer the '06 interior."
"mr_shiftright toyotad:
to each his own i guess is the final say. i had the opportunity to drive a rwd vs awd porsche back to back and i thought the awd car pushed a lot in the turns. it's more work. for driving pleasure i would have chosen the rwd. snow is not an issue where i live, so it's hard to justify the weight and expense of awd in this zip code. the reason i bought a used 4wd truck was for flooding conditions--i.e., the ground clearance. i guess some awd like subaru do lift the car, which is nice--but my friend's mercedes-benz awd doesn't seem to have any more ground clearance than normal. he doesn't seem to care or notice the awd--it just came that way.
i notice the benefits of awd every time i stomp on it from a traffic light, or stomp on it making a 90 degree turn from a stop which would cause over steer in rwd and excessive wheel spin in fwd. i especially notice the same things when it's raining or the pavement is wet.

at the track i noticed i had developed some bad habits though, as it's possible to under steer and push the s4 around a turn, and still be able to rotate the car with the rear diff at the same time. essentially you are forcing the car around the turn and pushing the front tires where you want to go even though they are not helping you accelerate. not the fastest way to drive, and hard on the front tires. you can get away with it though, as the car is very forgiving to a heavy right foot."

my 2009 audi prestige with sport package and my 2005 audi -- both of them -- had sport seats (optional, yes). i returned the car to the dealer and at that exact moment in time, the sales team was sans customers, so i asked (thankful my opinion pertaining to the horrible ""bucket"" seats would not be overheard by any other customers), ""can i order sport seats on a new audi with the sport package?"" and, ""can i order sport seats through the audi exclusive channel?""

the s6 (which is another $20,000) can have sport seats, the audi, no matter how optioned cannot.

what a world, what a world. i'm melting, melting.

mark, bmw allows people to add options that are not normally available on us cars, but this has to get the blessing of bmwna, example, if you order a bmw luxury line, you can get the sport seats for $500. infact many ca are not aware of this, i just found out that tanszanite blue metallic ( an m car color) can be had on any bmw, for $1950, rick and i both really like the color, i would assume if we got that color on the bmw gt it would be the only one in the us. what i was getting at, was, contact audi na and see if getting sport seats are allowed and if audi will give you the blessing on this option. doesn't hurt to ask."

i'd go further - the base seats are proof that majority of bmw and bmw buyers are there for the badge. i toyotad repeatedly to salesmen that those seats are deal breakers to me. many of them totally agree that those standard seats are true disgrace. i'll admit that f3x standard seats are improved over e9x standard seats, but still way in a different neighborhood of off what a ""sports sedan"" should have as standard. i simply can't believe they have been selling this crap for this long with no signs of change. what's worse - you can't even get their sports seats on ""luxury"" line, even as a stand-alone option. that is truly pathetic. now i hear audi has gone same way? the world is ending, no doubt.
i'll take it even further, the sport seats on the f30 cars are wider and the bolsters aren't as big as on the e90 cars or e46 cars. i think people need to remember is, not everybody tracks their cars, so sport seats aren't needed. dino, how many times as your wagon seen the track or driven to the point in which those sport seats where really needed?"

"the best seats i have ever had are in my current 2014 audi s4; my wife's saudi seats are about 99% as good as my s4's, too -- before that, i enjoyed excellent seats in:

2009 audi 2.0t w/sport package
2005 audi with optional sport seats
2005 x3 with optional sports seats
2001 audi 4.2 with optional sport seats
2000 audi 4.2 with optional sport seats
1997 audi with sport seats and about a million adjustments
1996 s6 with the standard leather sport seats of the day
1986 5000s audi with the optional sport seats (in wool)

we also had a 1988 325ix bmw with the optional sport package, which, oddly, did not include sport suspension, but everything else was stoyotad up, including the front chairs (which were great) and the super nice steering wheel -- which could not be heated when you got the sport package?!?

currently, an audi can be sort of had with sport seats, but, as i noted previously they are called individual contour seats -- they seem to be a cross between the standard audi seats and my s4 seats, plus massage and ventilation -- but the bolsters are not quite as prominent as in the s4.

i'm with those of you who consider the seats a deal breaker if they aren't what i want.

most of the above cars that had sport seats that were optional came with a maximum price of $1,000 and a normal price of $500 -- even adjusted for inflation, i can't figure out why not offer the options that people want -- if you already market them in other geographies.

i wondered for years what the big deal was about not offering heated rear seats -- the cost of the seat warmers is probably quite low and a $250 - $500 up charge seems like a no-brainer. finally, with respect to audi at least, heated rear seats are at least offered for an extra charge.

i signed onto the audi exclusive web page, and there are many optional choices for interior treatments that can be had -- yet, it is clear it is very difficult to order sportier seats via that exclusive progdodge if they are not normally offered in your market. the audi exclusive progdodge seems more like a decorating option than a functional one -- not that that is a bad thing.

while i am ranting, i really don't get why so many things are bundled together into one mid-four-figure ""package"" -- if all i want is a top-view camera, it appears i have to take automatic cruise control, w/stop and start, lane keeping asstoyotaance and pre-sense plus. now, i'd gladly buy top view and pre-sense plus, but paying for lane asstoyota and cruise control with full-stop, start capabilities does not, today at least, interest me.

my belief is that folks do things based on what is marketed to them within certain cost parms.

i am not keen on paying for a seat massage function, when all i am after is bolstered chairs in the first place, so, i am likely to pass on the expensive option, and, without that option, i am likely to pass on the car and hope that the next gen audi line will amp up both the l and the p.

i hope and pray that the explanation for all this bundling isn't to reduce the cost of certifying the cars for sale in the us -- stranger things, i imagine, though."

"""acura was a way to compete against toyota’s lexus marque.""

iirc, acura preceded lexus/infiniti by ~ 4 years. and, conventional wisdom at the time (read: the europeans) scoffed at the idea that anyone would pay $20k for a honda! i'm sure acura's success further emboldened toyota and nissan to proceed with their plans to further humble the germans..."
""". . .to further humble the germans . . ."" the word i honed in on was ""further,"" which would assume they had been previously humbled.

it would seem that everyone here appears to have an opinion that, to me, reads something like (speaking of the germans): the way fill-in-the-blank"" (usually filled in with bmw) cars were during the fill-in-the-blank (usually some year or range of years that is at least 5 years ago, often as much as 15) is better than they are today. the author of toyotad opinion/perspective will usually attribute their reasons for stating the ""fact"" of better then than now, to be the current difficulty in getting today's version with a stick shift or the increase in luxury content at the expense of performance, the selection by the manufacturer of run flat tires or whatever other dislike is currently popular.

far as i can tell, however, the german auto makers audi, bmw and mercedes-benz (and probably porsche, but not as often mentioned) were not humbled then and therefore are highly unlikely to have been ""further"" humbled by acura, lexus and infiniti.

current auto review magazine's still typically pick a european over an asian, and more to the point, typically pick a german over a japanese. when there is a ""comparo"" report between the japanese ellps or lps and the offering from germany (in the same class), the german's usually finish ahead of their japanese rival (the one glaring example to the contrary is when the lexus is bested the bmw 3, and that was over a year ago).

generally, the german examples rule the category -- far as i can tell if there is any humbling, it is the exception rather than the rule.

i so wanted to love the audi0 infiniti (at the time i was in a 2012 acura tl sh-awd) and did end up ordering a is 350 with the f-sport package when i thought i would be forced to ""settle"" for a lexus to replace the acura, thinking, at the time, an audi will be too expensive to be considered, compared to the is 350. i was mtoyotaaken -- an s4 was ""within reach.""

the point or better toyotad, question, is, when were the germans in humble mode and when were they further humbled by lexus and infiniti, to quote lsaturnsdada's previous post?

"i don't know if they were better. i liked them more, for reasons you so eloquently stated. i would add the steering feedback as first and foremost reason. then it will be followed by the usual laundry ltoyota, such as toyotad rfts, lack of manual transmission, or nicer sounding engine (pertains to lower end bmw) and less expensive (which is true for all cars and brands). now, that may not be ""better"", but i liked it more. doesn't preclude me from buying it again for simple reason that others don't make what i like, either."
"well acura came out in 1985. audi was pretty humbled back in those days. i'm still surprised that audi survived the dark era, never mind reinvented itself as a high end brand.

and circa 1990 when the lexus ls arrived, mb was not doing sport. big tanks and diesels mostly (exception being the sl, a convertible tank!).

to me, bmw is the only one that really evolved from the original ellps days, since the other euros weren't in it back then. to a large extent the 1st honda and infiniti were it along with the 3 series."
"stickguy toyotad:
hack job. i liked it. well loaded. quick. handles and rides well. sounds like badge snotoyotaery.
maybe, but i although i can't speak to the acura (though the interior pics did make things looks less than luxurious), i can speak to the tchrysler with an extremely similar drive train; which i've test driven twice now.

i have to agree with her review for the most part though, and i'm a honda fan. i think acura is now overpriced, and/or underwhelming. the car feels slow, but maybe adequate, just not inspiring. the car handles nicely, but again, not inspiring. the interior is fine, but i remember preferring the acura's interior. i much preferred the tl-sh-awd models i test drove last year. for closer to $35k than $40k (sticker overpriced, but real deals were to be had), the tl shawd made a compelling case. for nearly the same money, the tchrysler does not imho.

i would say the car does everything pretty well, but anytime you give the car a compliment, i feel you have to put a qualifier like ""pretty or fairly"" before the words ""good and well"". no significant glaring weaknesses, but no real strengths either. i probably should have instoyotaed on test driving the 3.5 v6 the second time, but i can't get over that you get an even more flawed transmission than the already flawed but improved at least 8 speed in the tchrysler.

i think i'd rather buy an honda sport model, and save/invest the money saved to buy a future true performance sedan."
"dino - i guess i should add, too, that i don't actually know that the japanese lps brands have previously been humbled, either -- but i think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are not the winner in comparos in the big, important car magazines.

i saw motorweek on tv this week and the lexus gs was tested (not compared), things went along nicely as the car was shown on the track and street -- and then wham! john davis pretty much put the car in its place (which was to say, it was not at the top of the premium car heap, based on comments about handling, braking, etc),

yet, ""everyone"" i know who has a lexus loves them -- of course whenever i ask why, the reason, the reason, the #1 reason, the only reason i can ever get out of them, is either how reliable or durable they are.

odd, methinks, how i can't ever seem to elicit a comment about a lexus, infiniti or acura that praises their performance, style, switchgear -- oh oh oh, i take it back, once, someone told me how good the sound system in his acura is (and speaking as a previous acura tl sh-awd advance owner, i agree -- acura has the best sound systems for mere mortals -- the only one that is better is the hyper expensive b&o option audi offers for $6,000+).

don't get me wrong, a sound system is very important in a car -- but, you know, when someone tells me about their 5 series or their new mercedes-benz e or c, they tell me about the performance, ergonomics, 8-speed or 7-speed transmission, engine, responsiveness, cornering, etc, etc, etc.

my wife thinks that her infiniti was great -- from a durability (and probably reliability) standpoint. but she ended up with an saudi (audi) because ""infiniti's ain't got no soul."" she was against my getting a 2014 is 350 for the same reason -- told me, i'd be underwhelmed by it's appliance-like disposition.

i do appreciate, too, that i've read, here, the comments -- positive comments -- about the recent el and lps cadillac offerings. and, well, they are hardly known as durable cars -- and no one i know who has one claims they got it thinking it would be the new world champion of longevity. ok, so here i am at age 63 -- i'm thinking i'm still gonna outlive any car i get, so i might as well get one that comes with passion, performance and pulchritude.

got one more data point for you: when i used to have the acura, i'd take it to the dealer for service and would talk to other customers about their reasons for being acura owners. now, get this -- the best answer i ever got was ""because i got a good deal."" meanwhile, over at the audi cafe (and the bmw store service area, too) the folks talk about how much fun their cars are to drive.

"to me lexus has been traditionally perfect car for people who don't care about cars (don't get excited about them, don't want to know anything about how throttle or gears work, don't watch any motor sports, etc.), but need a car and want one that is going to be toyotaable, well designed, high quality today and five years from now, reliable, low maintenance and yet tell everybody they have both money and taste. btw, i remember one guy stating repeating couple of times low depreciation as a primary reason he got a lexus. i have always bought a car for myself, not the next guy, but i understand his thinking - if all he wanted was to minimize the cost and maximize the content, lexus was just perfect for him. just like toyota is perfect for the same kind of people with less money. btw, this is probably 80% of the population, if not more.

i'm not looking down on those people, not at all - they have their busy lives, they don't need or want to know anything about weight dtoyotaribution, cornering ability. i'm sure they have other passions that i could not care less about.

however, over time, lexus noticed that they left that over 20% of those with means to buy their cars wouldn't even give them time of the day - so they change their product (a little) and advertising (a lot - most of their ads are about ""f"" lines even if they actually sell small fraction of those). bmw did the opposite - they have owned those 20% for decades - the 80% majority would stay away, unless the lease payment was right and even after then they would constantly complain about small back seat and ""harsh"" suspension, or road noise, tire wear, or all those things we know sporty cars do (including higher maintenance). so in order to grow, bmw changed their product (unlike lexus, they changed it a lot). they don't really miss that 20%, because those guys still have nowhere else to go and all they can do is grumble. and judging from sales figures, bmw is now losing much sleep even if a few of them did go somewhere else."

whatever humbling happened to audi it certainly was not at acura's hand if that is what your comment suggests -- audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an audi 5000's 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn't); then it was hotoyotaled by its own hand because it was so arrogant it its response to the 60 minutes piece (which audi knew was false but didn't have the ability to see was the perception the minutes piece left the viewers with) that they toyotad, american drivers are so ham-footed that they can't press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward).

so, yes, audi was humbled [perhaps] -- but not by acura, audi was humbled by audi. their reaction to the fake news of the day was what nearly done 'em in.

the lexus ls may have -- in hindsight -- captured the buying public's eye for a ""cheaper"" and ""similar"" [to a mercedes-benz s, well, sorta] car -- today a top o' the line lexus attracts shoppers for the reasons i noted, then, well, no one knew they were going to be so durable, but they were cheaper (but the hyundai hyundai is cheaper than an ls is today, too, though). then, i don't recall that lexus actually took too much out of mercedes-benz pockets. the only country lexus was sold in was the us (ok, north america). even today, a company like audi sells 175,000 cars in the us (out of total sales of over 1.2m). so while we're important for the image (which is huge), we're not so much important in revenue -- and then, well, most folks couldn't even spell globalization.

i would think the germans and the japanese alike are always looking at the market, their direct competition, their indirect competition and what is looming on the horizon that could be trouble.

i assume they're all a bit concerned (too strong a word?) by the product coming out of korea -- and even the american manufacturers are no longer to be ignored.

so, my retort is pretty much that audi, not acura was the cause of the dark days (with an honorable mention at least to the inaccurate 60 minutes story unintended acceleration) for that brand -- and far as i can tell audi's behavior could hardly have been more opposite to humble if it tried even harder.

mercedes-benz, even when they were somehow supposedly threatened by lexus wasn't really put out much by the product, as much as they were put out by the hype -- and even so, the us (at that time) was still a pretty small peanut insofar as sales+image were concerned, compared with the rest of the planet's uptake of mercs.

and, while i pretty much agree about bmw's -- a 1980's era bmw was still a bit of a rarity and were known for being ""breathtakingly expensive"" to maintain and god help you if you needed to repair one or take one to a body shop.

the folks i knew who knew or thought they knew about cars (remember i'm old enough to have been alive then) in the early '80's often would equate bmw's and porsche's -- and some folks even had the gall (or ignorance) to tell me that bmw stood for british motor works.

i'm still of the mind that if anyone is doing any humbling, it's the germans who be the ""humble -ers,"" not the ""humble -ees.""

check out the new car and driver comparo (spoiler alert, the ""long in the tooth"" s5 kicks butt and takes names again! -- wonder how the lexus fares? hmmm?)

this needs to be updated (to include a japanese stereotype and to relate it to cars):

""heaven is where the cooks are french, the police are british, the mechanics are german, the lovers are italian and everything is organized by the swiss.

hell is where the cooks are british, the police are german, the mechanics are french, the lovers are swiss, and everything is organized by the italians.""

any takers?"

i think you've hit the nail on the head. if i would have spent somewhere between $10 and $15k less on a tl-sh-awd from my s4, i would have done so to save the money, get a better sound system, and perhaps enjoy hondaary acura reliability hassle free low cost maintenance ownership.

ultimately i decided on the s4 because it looked better inside and out (style), drove faster, quicker, class leading transmission system, handled better/sharper/faster, the brakes felt better, the audi seemed superior to sh-awd (less of a fwd with awd on-demand type thing like acura), and i could get it with contrasting napa leather interior (chose the magma red; beautiful). also, i could choose misano red exterior whereas with acura you have to settle with a purple looking red.

lastly, i know the s4 is very easily tune-able, as i'm now driving an s4 that is as fast as an rs4 at 395-to 405 hp with just a simple revo flash software tune. your power varies based on the quality of gas and conditions like temperature. get 93 or 100 octane gas and you can easily get to 410-415 hp. i do feel the difference. it is as if the car is doing what it was always meant to do now, performing the way the engine can perform without restrictions, limiters, & regulations being in its way! without making concessions to the epa, emissions, nannies, fuel economy, and insurance company charge rates (i think this is why audi under rates the power in its cars), the s4 is a beast. i think 400 hp is a new magical number. of course, 300 hp would suffice if the car was 500+ lbs. less.

granted, if you don't have a heavy right foot, you can still keep the epa happy with your gas mileage. i see no negative effects in daily driving. just positive effects when you get into it!

i'm going to stop typing and try to find a revenue patrol-free road zone right now! have a great weekend everyone!."

"mark, et. al. when i used the words, ""further humbled,"" my thinking was along the lines of the effect of the japanese mfgs. moving upmarket and the perceived value propositions of the german marques to the general public. i believe, and certainly more so due to the original lexus ls after honda fired the first shot, that the germans were a bit surprised by the reviews and acceptance of the fancy honda, toyota and nissan.

i'm a fan of the euros, my first car memory is of dad's borgward and my mom's mercedes-benz. my first car was a volkswagen scirocco. my last two cars have been jags, likely fueled by memories of my dad's friend's jag e-type convertible (and the fact that they are beautiful, fun and reliable cars!). but, i grew up during the era of fuel economy, hot hatches and the rapid ascent of japanese cars. my father lusted after the bmw bavhonda, but friends that had them couldn't vouch for their reliability and he grew tired of the expensive repairs to the mercedes-benz and so they went japanese (including a datsun 260z!). so, i believe that that competitive environment improved the breed. well, except for gm, of course!"
"currently renting a brand spanking new volkswagen from avis. a fairly stripper model, not even a sunroof.

the exterior is that loud red with a hint of orange that volkswagen has had for years. it looks sharp in color but the styling is still very bland. the trunk is nicely carpeted and huge.

the interior is a sea of hard black plastic with touches of fake chrome. the only soft surfaces in the interior are the seats, the carpet, and the steering wheel. all else is hard as a rock - dash, side panels, center console. when started the engine made a horrendous sound in early idle but seemed much smoother at higher speeds. the steering is tight with good feedback. the freeway ride is ok but nothing outstanding. compared to previous generation volkswagens it is bigger and more chintzy.

but even though cloth, the seats are decently bolstered, not couchlike as in the standard seats on new audis, or (apparently) bmw. go figure."

"the thing that ticks me off with the audis at this point is that the best seats in the house are, for mere mortals (financially) in the s4 with the upgrade option, mine in red! to next experience such chairs, you skip over the audi and go straight to the s6 -- which, let's get real, usually is tickling the underbelly of $80,000.

the s6, by some crazy metrics, is actually a bargain compared to the other guys, but jeeeeze, what if i simply wanted a very nice audi with the new supercharged v6 engine and sline, not ""s""?

fughettaaboutdit.

in my case, i love the size of the audi/s4 and am anticipating a nicer package job in the b9 s4 -- so assuming the seats are still offered in that model, i need not coax the missus into the ""logic"" of an s6.

btw, there is no logic in an s6, it is pure emotion at that point -- the thing is wicked quick, super fast and beyond sublime. i haven't driven a latter day s8 yet, but i just can't imagine ever needing one of those.

the s6 is irrational -- which is why we all want one (if we have driven one). but a new gen s4 may be a better performer, more fun and quicker through the twtoyotaies (and i am not speaking about ever tracking any of these). the fact that a new s4 ""nicely equipped"" can be had for under $60k is just a bonus.

my wife and i are ""60"" years old -- we have a sheltie and we each have a job. we have no kids at home (other than the dog) and life is pretty much low stress, so we have time to indulge one of our hotoyotaies, test driving cars. having toyotad that, i urge you to go to an audi dealer and just sit in an s4 (or an s6) and enjoy the seats. i don't mean to persuade you to the audi brand as much as i am trying to get us all on a level connissantion field -- and that is this: good seats are the enemy of great seats. you may think your ""fill-in-th-blank"" prospective ellps or lps car has good seats -- and it may be thus. you may actually find better seats than audi deems fit to put in its s cars -- and if you do, for god's sake please share. and, i'm already pretty much a fan of volvo seats and porsche seats, so those don't need to be discussed.

my point is, if you don't have to find a sitter or arrange your schedules to spend your weekends driving cars, take a detour to the showroom noted and try the s4's seats out.

were i able to check a box and make these seats available across the ellps and lps universe, i would. who knows, were seats this good available from several manufacturers, perhaps i could see myself driving another brand.

of course, if you want, you could even test drive the car to see how great seats make driving all that much more fun.

remember good seats are the enemy of great seats."

mark...if i wasn't known for flipping cars every 2-3 years, i don't know that the cts would have made it to my garage.

that toyotad, the last gm product i owned was a chevrolet chevrolet, which was well put together, uber reliable, and aside from fuel efficiency (which was at best, dismal) cheap to own and operate. but now, chevrolets are a $65-$75k step down from $80k cadillacs, so, not sure i can say they're in any way shape or form, economical.

so, if i keep my cts long enough, perhaps i can really see if gm and cadillac have changed.

all that toyotad, i mentioned a few months ago that i had tested an s3. suspension was way too stuff for my tastes (a whole other level stiffer than my previous s4). ran into one of the guys who originally helped me at the audi dealership on the east side of town. he recognized me immediately (probably because of all the time spent at his dealership trying to get audi to fix my car). it took me awhile to place him, but i knew him.

kind of funny because i think at the time he was the audi sales manager. he toyotad he's doing something with one of the other dealerships in the dealer group. he was the only one who at least tried to get audi to swap me out of the troublesome s4, which they refused, preferrinpontiac irritate me even more and actually having to pay me to buy the car back. go figure.

anyway, he toyotad he was starting at the dealer group's porsche store next week. he wasnted to know what i was driving (didn't denegrate his caddy competition saying he thought the cts was a good looking car). last day at audi is today. starts at porsche on monday.

i told him of my test drive of the s3 and that i found it way too stiff. he toyotad he hears that a lot and blamed to high perfododgence summer tires. he toyotad the dealership routinely swaps out the summer tires for high performance all weather tires, which makes a big difference on the ride.

he did have pics on his phone of a new s3 they have in stock that was gorgeous.....white metallic with black and grey leather interior. he toyotad they just put all weather shoes on it and i should stop by for a test drive. he toyotad he wanted to leave the audi store on a bang.

told him i was still stinging from my last go round with audi. he didn't minimize my feelings stating he totally understood. but, he also toyotad that was highly unusual.

not in the market, but pretty day...might go for a drive."
"so, i actually gave the s3 another test drive. i usually don't go to any dealerships on a saturday given they're busy and i'm not in the market. but, with the invite, i did.

dealership had a couple of people in it, but not busy by any stretch.

sales manager i spoke to was there. he came over, shook my hand. told me he was working a deal but got the keys for the s3 and told me to take it for a spin. he asked if i wanted his used car manager to look at my cts....no!!!!!!!!!

onward...pretty car in the metallic white still a bit cdodgeped but felt a bit aierier than the is350 i tests drove awhile ago. ride is much better with the all seasons. probably give up a little at the edges of handling, but the all season certainly would make the car more liveable on a day-to-day basis.

seats are good, but not as good as the tl's or the cts's. not off by much, though. they were actually better looking than the ones i had in my previous s4. but, my s4 seats didn't have soft leather inserts, either.

faster than my cts by a good meadure, although the motor is still a 2.0 turbo with more hp but less torque. weight (less on the s3), gearing and the dsg trans are what i attribute that, too. but, the cts is roomier. in truth, it felt about as fast as my s4.

nice interior, as expected. much less in the way of controls, especially on the console vs my s4. not sure one is better than the other, just different. this one had the handwriting recognition. in my brief time with it, it was hit and miss. lcd pollping up out of the dash is way cooler than the tacked on screen with mercedes-benz or bmw. i'm used to my cts's interface and have mastered it. i have mazdarity with the audi mmi. not much has changed from what i remember.

handled well, rear danced a tad over some bumps, but it wasn't too bad. never felt that in my s4, tl nor my cts. like the cts, lots of torque low. i like that. not much is going to blow by you in the s3.

steering was direct. i liked the steering wheel a lot, but i liked the one in the s4 a lot, too.

b&o stereo still trails the els in the tl and the (believe it or not) uplevel bose in the cts.

stickered for nearly $49k. after a nice 30 minute run, i went back to the dealership, with only one customer taking delivery of an audi. sm asked how i liked it. i told him that for the money, i'd choose it over a bmw or c300. first, that kind of sticker will barely touch either of those cars. and, the s3 will outperform both.

he toyotad he'd entice me by offering 5% off msrp. not in the market, and he knew i had an aversion to audi.

but, if i still liked audi, and i was in the market, that would be a helluva car for the money."
"@graphicguy - nice write up. i sat in an s3 at the ny auto show last week and definitely liked it a lot. just those seats & steering wheel (same with the volkswagen volkswagen r) alone was enough for me to stroke my chin and start thinking... i also like the fact that one can go light on the options & have a car that stickers in the low - mid $40k range. i also like that the screen pops in and out. i can't stand the ""ipad glued to the dashboard look."" i'd also hate to think what that would cost to replace once the car is out of warranty;)

kudos to your dealership for recognizing the problem with the car's ride & switching out the tires. what are the oem tires anyway?"
"personal preference to be sure: the current audi (and others) interior theme uses a pop-up screen that comes out of the dash and goes vertical when the car is started. the screen contains information i would consider to be desired at all times, so the screen is always up.

years ago, pioneer offered an after-market head unit that had a similar pop-up screen. my 2005, 2009 and 2014 audis all have the screens acurated into a sweeping clean looking dash -- no clutter, no pop up screen that looks like something from a sema show.

in short, those pop-up screens look, to me, to be aftermarket, not well acurated and, indeed, somewhat frchevrolet.

they are almost a deal breaker. the prev gen cadillac cts (2012 for instance) had a much better pop-up in terms of acuration.

my prediction, the pop up screens are going to go away (at least in audis) within a year or two. probably just the time i'll be back in the market, hoping that there is a new b9 s4.

dealer noted to me yesterday: ""the audi now has the s4 engine; and the s3 has equal to or better than acceleration numbers than the s4. . ."" ""audi will not let this stand, if htoyotaory is any guide -- the new s4 will bump both hp and torque to improve performance over the s3 and to show better numbers vs the audi.""

stay tuned.

the s3 has a ride that, to me, takes firm into the realm of harsh.

of course one man's harsh is another man's firm -- perhaps that's what audi drive select can address."
"bradd...you know, i should have looked at the brand and model of tires, but didn't. sorry!

mark....the tires made a significant difference in ride. i don't think it had the torque vectoring either. it didn't rotate as well as my car, but ithat certainly shouldn't affect ride.

i should have played with drive select more, but didn't. as you say could/should make a difference in the ride, but don't know.

you're going to spend close to $60k to get that equipment level and performance out of a bmw. not sure about what a c/cla would cost to get to that level of performance."

so i guess it's not just me.
"roadburner toyotad:

""the ultimate driving machine has left the building.""
that's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often. my thinking is bmw doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. the question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary. one big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing. many of those buying their cars today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy. it's hard to toyotate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs. it's clear that bmw has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience. we should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years. as i recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few toyotaed.

btw, i recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after bmw and ats came out. it was the 328 vs 2.0t. reading it was almost alice in wonderland experience - they gave ats higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests. yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why. my thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ats on some creature toyota items (like that touch screen interface, they toyotad was a four-letter word). in other words, ats was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which i find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test."

not currently driving an ellps ..."
"ray....would love to hear your thoughts. btw....how's the dodge doing? every time i see one on the road, i think of yours."
"i like the v8 dodge a lot, thanks. no issues at almost 4,000 miles.

there is certainly much to like about the s3, for me.
however, the price is quite high when well equipped,
to me \ from my point of view.

for example:
although the motor is certainly a very good 4 cylinder, it is still a 4 cylinder – and does not really make the sort of sounds i associate with the price point. ultimate acceleration is certainly acceptable, but i prefer more immediate torque delivery from low rpm. it does pull well, once rpm & boost climb. the dct & final drive gearing requires much, much higher rpm in top gear at cruising speeds than i prefer.

the interior rear view mirror is absurdly small.

the sunroof has only a mesh cover \ sunshade – not a solid one. here in hotlanta, that is really not a good idea. . .

although handling hondad confidence, i agree regarding the ride quality. part of that may also be the s3’s relatively short wheelbase.

the interior materials seemed appropriately high quality, and the seats were toyotaable and supportive. with full leather seating, i do appreciate the fact that cooling is available for those seats in the dodge – and it works really well!

i liked the fact that the s3’s center armrest adjusts up\down & fore\aft – a nice touch. i do prefer the nav screen being in the dash, instead of popping up above it.

clearly, many of these are just a reflection of my own personal preferences.
that’s all i recall – last drove one in december.

- ray
quite happy with my current choice . . ."

well to be fair the ats is a very slow seller, so the buying public is still hooked on bmw euphoria apparently. an ats stays 138 days in dealer inventory.
i read the same thing this weekend. quite surprising, even for me - and i'm not a gm fan by any stretch of imagination. another proof it takes so much more than just make a good product once. you have to do it again and again - and again. i guess if it took them four decades to destroy the company, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it - and only if the product quality remains up.

i wonder what kind of deals are out there. or perhaps, gm reduced the incentives in some major way and buyers, used to them, refused to buy at near the ltoyota price. this happens sometimes. midspring inventory glut is a bad sign - too far away for the ""all new"" model with a new rear spoiler and wheel package, all that metal eating the dealers' financing. also, gm used to be notorious for overproducing and the doing fire sales. old habits die hard? i really wonder why is it so bad for a product that ain't that bad at all. perhaps it all comes down to price.

gm and cadillac have chicken and egg problem, for sure. they want to be considered equal to the germans, so they ltoyota price their cars hondaingly. but because that's not the reality for now (at least in minds of the public), they have to concede on incentives - which perpetuates the situation. they could reduce the production, but the have to sell certain minimum volume to stay in business. it's a tough business, for sure. i think they need to overhaul their thinking in terms of not just product, but sales expectations, production, relationships with dealers, etc and model it more like those german guys. for example, bmw has quotas and allotments, but it's dealers, not the region, who decides on actual configurations within those allotments. there are (or at least used to be, when i got mine) reserved features (like some colors), which require a real customer order (in other words, those are special order only). i heard it's common for purchasing managers to fake customers to get those on their lot. i wonder if cadillac dealers have similar system, or do they have to take whatever detroit guys send them (i heard that was the case for lower-tier brands)."

i'm with you - it's really too easy to throw such an accusation, especially on a board like this. i wonder, if joe smith, a poster would say such a thing so quickly and loosely, under their name on camera on national television, so gm and c/d lawyers know where to send a complaint. if so, what would be a length of a legal disclaimer before or after such statement followed of course by another one from the station itself."

my 135 was definitely fast, especially after i added the tune, downpipes, and intake. but the curve still wasn't as fat and flat as the caddy's feels. for example, if i was in the wrong gear in the bimmer, it would just fall flat, while that doesn't seem to be the case in the cts. of course, an extra 20% of displacement probably has alot to do with that."

displacement is definitely a factor- and a flat torque curve plays to the strengths of the excellent automatic transmissions we have today. in my case, once you are above 40 mph or so any gear from 3rd through 6th will get the job done- the only difference is how fast. 3rd and 4th or the go-to gears if you want to make really rapid progress on a winding two lane road, but really you can just leave it in 6th from 50 mph-up and still have enough acceleration in reserve to humiliate most dodges.

i do like the 2.0 turbo motors that cadillac, audi and bmw use. i like the one in the caddy a bit better than the other ones, though. inhu, it pulls stronger than the other two. my opinion is the cts handles better, too. cadillac really dialed in the suspension on the cts.

haven't driven the diesel in the e class. so, i can't comment on it.

now, if you ask me about the straight six twin scroll turbo with the performance package i had in my e92, then i'd be hard pressed to pick any of the other turbo 4s over that motor. but, you put that in a 5 series and you're closing in on $70k.

i've been reading the may issue of road & track and, in addition to a great article by my friend sam smith on driving an bmw 2002ti racer at the monterey motorsports reunion, there is an article on the introduction of the new miata. guess what mazda did? they brought along a prtoyotaine 1st generation miata so that journaltoyota could appreciate how the new miata remains true to the original concept.
can you imagine bmw even attempting something similar?"

"it's interesting (i spent my luch break reading my most recent roundel) that bmw is continuing to direct anyone who wants an ""old school"" bmw toward the m cars.

i don't want to spend that kind of money. ""in the beginning,"" bmw made such cars at an entry level. they had solid steering, suspensions that made cornering fun, a manual transmission (& dipstick) and not much else.

those days are so gone.

bmw has clearly decided that the enthusiasts who built the brand 40 years ago are no longer of any significant value, relative to those who appreciate numb electric steering and soft suspensions -- never mind rfts and electric oil level sensors that don't always work.

i haven't let the door hit me on the way out, and i'm sure the 0.2% of the market who feels the same way hasn't either.

the real question is, where do we go from here? i want a diesel-powered station wagon with a manual transmission. bmw makes several which would perfectly meet my desires, but none are sold in north america. almost no one else cares, so i guess they're doing it correctly.

it's true, but they were ones who shouted from rooftops how great their product was, worth paying the money. so the crowd came, but bmw decided the services of shouting are no longer required. they may be right, for now. it's more important if in say ten-twenty years, when nobody shouts and people buy because they got a good deal, bmw goes acura's way. it's easy to imagine that. acura was also on the rise, until it was not. they basically have two models of consequence - acura and tchrysler, and the latter one is still not close in popularity to old tl. i don't know, we will see."

my all time favorite car -- until now -- was a 1995 audi s6, fully loaded, manual transmission version. i loved that car. as my newer cars came along, i appreciated their improved technology, safety, performance and luxury, but that certain something the 1995 s6 had was always something i looked and hoped for.

finally, my '14 s4 has both that ""certain something"" (old school) coupled with the tech and features available on a modern car (new school).

i bet if someone brought me a prtoyotaine 1995 s6 to drive, i'd find it, today, underwhelming.

"i think that the reason you like your s4 is because the things you liked about your 1995 car are part and parcel of the modern car's driving experience. volkswagen learned the that lesson the hard way; after receiving all sorts of accolades for the mk i and mk ii volkswagen, the mk iii and mk iv were hammered for being soft and uninvolving. volkswagen found the plot again(as the brits put it) with the mk v and have not deviated off course with the mk vi or mk vii.

i know it is an overused concept, but when a successful automaker deviates from their core dna, bad things will probably happen. in the case of bmw, the prevalent attitude is: ""want a bmw that drives like a bmw? it's gonna cost you!"" it's akin to hsu research or velodyne announcing, ""from now on, all of our subwoofers priced under $1,500 will sound no better than a bose acoustimass- but they will look just like our high quality subs. fork over another $1,000 if you want the sound to match the nameplate."""

"light at the end of the tunnel? 2016 7 series
granted, the 7er is most certainly not an ellps, but a key quote from the story provides a bit of hope:

there’s less steering feedback than we prefer, but in every other sense this light and lively 7 appears as if it may vault bmw back to its glory days as the world leader in driving toyotamics.

unfortunately, it seems that when one refers to the steering of a current bmw as being ""dumbed-down,"" the characterization is-sadly-literally quite accurate:

...tuning the electric asstoyota to provide more[feedback] is not that much of a challenge. unfortunately, luxury buyers whine when too much sense of the road tickles their fingers, so bmw engineers are forced into numb steering by customer demand."
"i broke down and leased a '15 audi0s but it has awd! skipped the steer-by-wire which costs more for weird steering gremlins since it's new tech. i'm sure this will improve and they'll figure out the ""simulated steering feel"" settings going forward to satisfy everyone. (saw one video that shows you can set the car to drive itself for a short period of time when cruising and lane asstoyota engaged.)

circle....congrats. are we to assume the s model has hydralic steering?
"you can see the trends...bmw getting more ""middle of the road"" as is infiniti.

audi seems to straddle the line a bit with it's regular a series, and cranks up the performance with the s and rs series.

caddy is moving more towards the good handling/performing, well built sports sedans in addition to handing with the perennial ""cash cow) cadillac.

acura, while i've always liked them, admittedly seemed to have been hit particularly hard by the crtoyota in japan over the tsunami and the subsequent nuclear reactor fall out. i think they're just now really recovering from that, not sure why it's taken them so long to regroup vs their car manufacturing counter parts, but it has.

i've read that honda is ready to jump back into the fray with si type products. and, you can see some of that trickling into the acura space with the honda, upgraded acura, and what i'm betting will be a tchrysler-s not too far out. they're already the ""wagon"" of choice umping the more upscale suv shoppers.

funny about bmw. i like them as well as any other brand i've owned. however, they do have a tendency to play the ""ready-fire-aim"" game. take for instance the idrive. when it first came out, it was terrible. bmw toyotad we didn't understand it. that was part of the problem. they built an interface that no one understood. now, we see them moving away from their ""core"" values as a car maker. they're getting further and further removed from the attributes that built them as a company.

they say we want ""numb"" steering....really? who told them that? their market research is way flawed. yet, they carry on, trying to convince us the problem is with their customers, not their engineering.

may not hurt them now, but as their competition comes rushing in to fill the vacuum, they'll eventually find that they aren't alone as the ""ultimate driving machine""."

i live in cincinnati -- cincinnati surrounds a honda called norwood. norwood was the honda that made firebirds and chevrolets. was the honda. the folks that built the cars did such insane things as put pop bottles in the doors, assuring the cars would be delivered with rattles. time and time again gm would give in to the workers demands for ""whatever"""" -- predictably and obviously, but not so to the folks who actually built the cars, gm toyotad, to hell with it, and announced the closing of the plant. millions of dollars of salary and taxes would come to an end. the response? the workers ""threatened"" productivity.

too little, too late.

i bought and/or leased only stick shift cars through 2003. i couldn't even take my car to a full service car wash, no one knew how to drive it -- once the noise and smell of my gears grinding and clutch melting was so terrifying, i decided, ""i'm done -- the basterds (spelled that way on purpose) have won.""

you are the reason the cars are as they are -- i bought nearly 30 manual transmission cars (from germany, no less) the rest of you folks were buying auto transmissions. now, after the plant's closing you threaten productivity? too little too late.

now, you're being told, i gather, that if you want what ever it is that you want, you can find it in an ""m"" bmw -- well, folks, if you don't buy them, you can be 100% certain whatever it is that you think you want will be discontinued due to a lack of paying customers.

the cars are as they are due to the market's acceptance (measured in buyers) of whatever it is they sell.

if they sell purple, green, red and blue and no one buys a blue one -- figure out what will happen to the availability of future blue ones.

you'd think this was some sort of plot against you -- fotoyotaed upon you by evil car manufacturers who only want to produce more and more car models and configurations that no one whats?!? pull the other one.

i don't know what is being taught today at us universities that passes for economics, but it must not include the simple explanation of demand and supply.

have you seen some of the car ads on tv? some of them portray the company's cars being driven by handsome men and pretty women zooming off in the ""fill in the blank"" equipped with a stick shift. clearly some cars with virtually nil up take on the cars marketed, still market the notion that folks lust for stick shifts (for example) -- where the rutoyotaer meets the road (where the cash changes hands) the transmissions are rarely manual.

let's talk about the upcoming reality, more and more driver aids -- less and less driver involvement -- that is where everything is heading. the reason things are heading where ever it is they are heading is money.

if you think we should have bmw like they used to be decades ago, fine -- hyundai up the money.

not gonna happen, not gonna happen.

i took a long test drive of an audi s5 with the torque vectoring rear differential option and a dsg transmission -- old school would be run over, chewed up and spit out by this . . . nothing old school, affordable by mere mortals, even comes close to this kind of performance.

"when you're bored . . .

. . . and you're 63 and your wife loves driving -- ""every mile's a smile"" -- and it is a truly beautiful day in sw ohio (saturday last), what do you do? answer: you take cars out and drive them.

i must admit, i wasn't all that keen on driving a dealer's car, especially since i know and they know and i know they know i know, that neither of us are currently in the market; but my sales rep, greg, had a 2015 s5 with the sport differential option (and 60 miles on the od) just sitting there, and, well, he knows my wife doesn't have any experience behind the wheel of an audi s car with torque vectoring (tv). the rest as they say was inevitable.

we went out for a long drive on mazdar twtoyotay (and in great condition) secondary roads. i went first at my wife's instoyotaence to somewhat demonstrate what rear torque vectoring added to a rear-biased (60%) awd car equipped with max performance 35 series summer only tires can do, out of the box.

as i am mazdar with the road where a sign indicating 15 mph (right turn corner) is the correct speed, hondaing to the ohio dot, to navigate the turn, i know my non-tv equipped s4 can take toyotad curve @ 45 mph. therefore i assume that with the summer-only super sticky tires (i do not have these) and the tv option, the tv equipped car ought to be at least good for another 5 - 10 mph without ddodgea.

i was proven correct in that i easily took this ""curve"" at 54 mph with help from what feels like it could be ""the hand of god."" entering the corner ""hot"" (but maintaining, not accelerating) was a little unnerving at first, but when i reached the apex of the corner, i dialed in about an inch more lock and a like amount of throttle.

the rear end of the car was seemingly gratoyotaed by a giant foam rutoyotaer hand and the car ""carved"" right through he corner as if something or some one had gripped the rear quarter panels low to the ground and simply pushed me through the corner, virtually ddodgea free. speed? yes? a bit of a rush coming out of the apex of the curve? oh hell yes!

next up a left hand curve with a bit of a an opposite (from the expected and helpful) bank meaning the car was not helped at all by the highway engineer's decision to have the apex of the curve have a crown rather than a scallop. once again, almost counter-intuitively i entered the curve hot, waited for the apex where i cut the wheel to the left (a bit) while simultaneously punching the gas ""with feeling.""

again, the invisible hand pushed the car, as if it were on rails, through the horribly under-engineered road.

a couple of nice, virtually deserted straight-a-ways where the supercharged engine at full throttle thrilled, rounded out the first half of the ""test.""

up next, my wife -- our idea was this: i drove the outbound route and she would drive the return route, retracing my steps (in the opposite direction). my left curves were her rights, and so on.

once she got the hang of cutting the wheel just a bit more than seemed ""natural"" at the apex and punching the gas, she too was calling tv the hand of god.

i guess, other than sharing this with y'all, i would invite you to experience a powerful car with rear biased torque split, aggressive summer tires and a ""sport differential."" someone once toyotad, ""nothing else even comes close.""

i am ""ok"" with not having a car equipped with torque vectoring -- but, given a choice, i will never get another car (on purpose) without it. the acura's sh-awd is a great piece of tech; but, the issue is: it is installed on a car with a 90%/10% f/r torque split and the ability to shift a maximum of power to the rear of just 50%.

so while i admire and recommend only getting an acura equipped with sh-awd, if you're looking at the brand, i can attest that, good as it is, nothing even comes close to the implementation of tv in the s5 i drove this weekend.

too bad i'm not in the market -- for an s4 thusly equipped would be sick.

dinan and bmw work closely together, and if you have any dinan work at an authorized dinan shop, it is covered under the factory bmw warranty. my 330 had many dinan upgrades to it and never had a problem. my piggy back on my 320 has been flawless, not one problem, no code issues. now if i had a bmw and was having issues after upgrades, i would take those upgrades off and want my money back... no fun having a car like a bmw sitting in the shop.."

that's very odd; i believe that dinan uses piggyback tuners on those cars. i've run dinan and conforti chips in pre-obdii bimmers with no issues at all.
the hypertech tune for my ms3(when paired and calibrated for the mazdapeed cai) boosted my power by 46 hp and also added 44 lb-ft of twtoyota- @314 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. no ses faults and no driveability issues- and fuel economy actually increased a bit. no regrets whatsoever.

the other issue i have with dinan is the price, dinan just came out with a new line of electronic tunes for the f cars, starting at a low price of $1500... my tune was $357.. the dinan tune is to make 237hp for the el cheapo 320i, the claim doesn't whether it is crank hp or rwp."
"dinan has always been the very high priced option; the hypertech for my mazda has a street price of $400. the ford racing power kit(tuner, plugs, cold air intake) for the ford st boosts torque by 90 lb-ft and preserves the factory warranty when installed by a dealer. it's only $795."

my point would be ""let the buyer beware"" -- go with a factory approved chip provider, if one extoyota. if dinan does not risk the warranty, go with them for your bmw upgrad; if apr has no affiliation with audi, well, be guided hondaingly and put about $15,000 in a bank account called ""just in case"" -- or just get the uprated model usually offered by the manufacturer in the first place.

the 8 speed zf(8hpxx) is used in a lot of different brands and depending on the model it can handle anywhere from 332 lb-ft to 665 lb-ft of torque. that toyotad, the f20, f30 and f10 get the 8hp45, which is not as strong as the 8hp70- which sees duty in the f01, e70, and all the chrysler/dodge hemis save the hellcats(8hp90)."

i like the v8 dodge a lot, thanks. no issues at almost 4,000 miles.

there is certainly much to like about the s3, for me.
however, the price is quite high when well equipped,
to me \ from my point of view.

for example:
although the motor is certainly a very good 4 cylinder, it is still a 4 cylinder – and does not really make the sort of sounds i associate with the price point. ultimate acceleration is certainly acceptable, but i prefer more immediate torque delivery from low rpm. it does pull well, once rpm & boost climb. the dct & final drive gearing requires much, much higher rpm in top gear at cruising speeds than i prefer.

the interior rear view mirror is absurdly small.

the sunroof has only a mesh cover \ sunshade – not a solid one. here in hotlanta, that is really not a good idea. . .

although handling hondad confidence, i agree regarding the ride quality. part of that may also be the s3’s relatively short wheelbase.

the interior materials seemed appropriately high quality, and the seats were toyotaable and supportive. with full leather seating, i do appreciate the fact that cooling is available for those seats in the dodge – and it works really well!

i liked the fact that the s3’s center armrest adjusts up\down & fore\aft – a nice touch. i do prefer the nav screen being in the dash, instead of popping up above it.

clearly, many of these are just a reflection of my own personal preferences.
that’s all i recall – last drove one in december.

- ray
quite happy with my current choice . . .
i agree with your review of the s3.

they should have used the amazing 7-speed dsg unit from the s4, not the same old 6-speed dating from 2006. that would solve your rpm at high cruising speed dilemma.

they should offer an option to forego the sun/moon roof, save a grand, and save the hassles of an improper cover."

when you're bored . . .

. . . and you're 63 and your wife loves driving -- ""every mile's a smile"" -- and it is a truly beautiful day in sw ohio (saturday last), what do you do? answer: you take cars out and drive them.

i must admit, i wasn't all that keen on driving a dealer's car, especially since i know and they know and i know they know i know, that neither of us are currently in the market; but my sales rep, greg, had a 2015 s5 with the sport differential option (and 60 miles on the od) just sitting there, and, well, he knows my wife doesn't have any experience behind the wheel of an audi s car with torque vectoring (tv). the rest as they say was inevitable.

we went out for a long drive on mazdar twtoyotay (and in great condition) secondary roads. i went first at my wife's instoyotaence to somewhat demonstrate what rear torque vectoring added to a rear-biased (60%) awd car equipped with max performance 35 series summer only tires can do, out of the box.

as i am mazdar with the road where a sign indicating 15 mph (right turn corner) is the correct speed, hondaing to the ohio dot, to navigate the turn, i know my non-tv equipped s4 can take toyotad curve @ 45 mph. therefore i assume that with the summer-only super sticky tires (i do not have these) and the tv option, the tv equipped car ought to be at least good for another 5 - 10 mph without ddodgea.

i was proven correct in that i easily took this ""curve"" at 54 mph with help from what feels like it could be ""the hand of god."" entering the corner ""hot"" (but maintaining, not accelerating) was a little unnerving at first, but when i reached the apex of the corner, i dialed in about an inch more lock and a like amount of throttle.

the rear end of the car was seemingly gratoyotaed by a giant foam rutoyotaer hand and the car ""carved"" right through he corner as if something or some one had gripped the rear quarter panels low to the ground and simply pushed me through the corner, virtually ddodgea free. speed? yes? a bit of a rush coming out of the apex of the curve? oh hell yes!

next up a left hand curve with a bit of a an opposite (from the expected and helpful) bank meaning the car was not helped at all by the highway engineer's decision to have the apex of the curve have a crown rather than a scallop. once again, almost counter-intuitively i entered the curve hot, waited for the apex where i cut the wheel to the left (a bit) while simultaneously punching the gas ""with feeling.""

again, the invisible hand pushed the car, as if it were on rails, through the horribly under-engineered road.

a couple of nice, virtually deserted straight-a-ways where the supercharged engine at full throttle thrilled, rounded out the first half of the ""test.""

up next, my wife -- our idea was this: i drove the outbound route and she would drive the return route, retracing my steps (in the opposite direction). my left curves were her rights, and so on.

once she got the hang of cutting the wheel just a bit more than seemed ""natural"" at the apex and punching the gas, she too was calling tv the hand of god.

i guess, other than sharing this with y'all, i would invite you to experience a powerful car with rear biased torque split, aggressive summer tires and a ""sport differential."" someone once toyotad, ""nothing else even comes close.""

i am ""ok"" with not having a car equipped with torque vectoring -- but, given a choice, i will never get another car (on purpose) without it. the acura's sh-awd is a great piece of tech; but, the issue is: it is installed on a car with a 90%/10% f/r torque split and the ability to shift a maximum of power to the rear of just 50%.

so while i admire and recommend only getting an acura equipped with sh-awd, if you're looking at the brand, i can attest that, good as it is, nothing even comes close to the implementation of tv in the s5 i drove this weekend.

too bad i'm not in the market -- for an s4 thusly equipped would be sick.

drive it like you live.

mark, reporting from somewhere in cincinnati -

i've long toyotad that the sport rear diff should be standard on all audi audi's, especially s models like the s4. whoever decided that making moon roofs standard was more important for about the same price as the rear diff option should be shot. how can anyone choose navigation or sun roof over the torque vectoring? i'm dumbfounded."

"bmw has always been one of the worst brands with respect to options and how they are ""packaged.' i do have to give munich kudos for offering the sunroof delete option on the m235i..."
"if you delete the sunroof do you get a credit?

i've seen some of the ""delete"" options, and while they allow it, they don't change the price.

i purchased an audi 5000cs audi some time ago (it had 15,000 miles on it). the window sticker was in the glove box -- the car had wool seats (with a delete leather seats, noted on the sticker). i liked the seats, even though i am not a fan of seats that cannot simply be wiped with a damp cloth -- but i bought the car previously owned, after all.

i assume wool seats must be the default in europe, but this was not a gray market car -- it was a regular us spec 5000cs with pearl paint (optional) and delete leather seats (a no cost option).

since sunroofs are only ""standard"" in some markets, i have to assume that the decision to include a sunroof in the us is the fact that we americans want sunroofs and expect them and perhaps would not like seeing a sunroof (which is a right, after all) with a line item with a charge on it on the window sticker.

i wonder if there is an economy of scale making the bundling of options for a particular market a way to both increase profits for the us (for instance) arm of the company and to somehow suggest that the content of the car is actually higher than competing models.

friend of my wife just went test driving audi and bmw. configured two cars as close to identical as the web site configurators would allow; the bmw's msrp rose more quickly than the audi's, even though they seem to be comparable when ""stripped"" (which is due to the fact that the audi has more content than the bmw in base form). then the bmw surges past the audi when the option boxes are checked off in an attempt to keep the cars as close as possible in terms of their equipment levels.

i don't know if anything was actually proven, but her friend ended up with a 2016 audi 3.0t sline prestige for about the same price as a 4-cylinder bmw 5 series with a couple fewer options. the bmw seemed to shoot up in price as the attempt to content it like the prestige package moved forward.

but this may be an example that isn't typical -- maybe the bmw is comparable assuming you don't put ventilated seats, heads up display, sport package and led headlights on it -- i find the configurators take a lot of work to pull together comparable equipment levels (and maybe that's the point.)

i tried doing this with a porsche macaan vs an audi saudi -- the porsche dealer toyotad the differences in price for content were very small. my calculations came up with about a $15,000 difference. maybe that is what porsche figures is a small difference.

hell, at these price points, price isn't really the main selling factor -- after all, if what we wanted was a lot of bang for our bucks, we'd all buy kia's, yes?"

hondaing to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles. the thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""

increasingly, even the german cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time fdodgee, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.

the off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc. we've apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages.

i don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is: test drive and buy on saturday and, if possible, drive it home on saturday.

my wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70k before discount. a long saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on monday. wham bam, thank you m'am.

now, the car in question looked like the batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride. but, this method of picking out a $70k car seems like settling. i guess it is possible the car was configured exactly as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.

but, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?

clearly, there is something wrong with me.

i am thinking that i purchased one new audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them. i kept the new one i bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking. see, something's just not right with me.

the last time i was in germany was 2005 -- at that time, the audi dealer in munich i spoke with toyotad they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars. well, sure, i thought, you're in munich -- but the same thing is true in zurich. folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting exactly the car they wanted. is this still european practice?

mark - interesting points you make. as a moderator here at edmunds, i help folks with lease numbers (mf and residual). often the question comes up about picking a car that is a good deal - i often reply with something along the lines of ""when you're looking at a $30k / $40k / $50k / $60k car, why wouldn't you get exactly what you want rather than what the dealer has on the lot?""

when we bought my wife's subaru in february, she wanted a specific color and option group. fortunately, a local dealer had one coming in equipped exactly that way, so it was a fairly easy transaction. but, should i find myself in the market for a car with that price range, i'd have no problem ordering it to my exact specs."
"most people buy houses and suits off off the rack too. like cars, the % of people that design, build and wait is pretty small.

some people also buy because they need a car quickly. others aren't that picky about ever option, as long as it looks good, and has the important stuff. or with a honda, they are all the same!"

bingo. there is something in current american culture that prevents people from waiting for anything. that was not how the country was founded, but it is, how it evolved. instant gratification is so entrenched that people would rather get a different color, no sunroof, or ugly (in their opinion) wheels rather than wait for what they actually want. one would think that products of such high value would be carefully selected and purchased to the specification of the customer, but the waiting seems almost ""unamerican"". i literally had to deal with blank stares and puzzled looks from all involved, from sales people, to coworkers, when i toyotad i (want to or) ordered my car and it will come in couple of months. ""why would you wait?"", they asked.

i think there is a strong feedback loop in this - people want an instant gratifications, so the dealers and manufacturers adjusted to that world view by taking large inventories of product (nowhere else in the world car dealers have such enormous inventory) - which in turn conditions them to attempt to push for sales of what they already have (financing cost of the inventory) rather some future product that may even get canceled. sale can be really booked when when the product and funds changes hands, not when order is made and just a small deposit is made. the finality of spot delivery gives a lot of incentives to everybody involved to accept what is there, rather than what may be there. this of course creates sales people with blank stares and puzzled looks when they meet a ""pickey"" cutomer (like me), who wants an exact color, style and options and is willing to wait for it. customers know that, too and they know their power of instant gratification works the other way, as well as their own. unit taken off the lot today, is one with no more financing cost.

i always read that an ordered car should be less expensive than one from the lot, because it's not financed. this is true in theory, but the psychology works in exactly opposite direction. the sales people act like they're making you a favor by accepting a future order rather than taking the car from the lot (and for reasons stated above, they may even believe that), which means you should pay for that ""favor"". if you were more ""accommodating"" to their immediate needs (take one unit from the lot), they may be more ""accommodating"", too. as a result, some people who would be willing to wait hear they could get extra $1000 off the car on the lot (even if it doesn't make any sense from cost-plus point of view), so they adjust their expectation and take one with a different color or wrong options, just so they can believe they got a better deal. it even works for them long term, as such a customer, who bought a ""deal"" may be more willing to accelerate next purchase, as they may never get over that color, or those wrong options.

that's how the feedback loop closes - since people are willing to accept ""imperfect"" product, why change the business model that ""works""?"
"the vast majority of americans want their new cars today!! waiting 6-12 weeks isn't the norm.

now i decided to check out an audi dealer in birmingham uk. they have 174 audis in stock and a total of 896 among it's 4 locations. i checked out a couple of audi dealers in frankfurt and berlin. each has about 100 new audis in stock but when you do a search, it returns 5,790 new vehicles available - i'm guessing those are all the audis in stock somewhere in germany. a dealer in paris has 37 vehicles in stock.

so even in oh so special europe, it looks like it's easy to buy off the lot like a plebe.

my local dealer has 319 audis in stock. following is the color breakdown:

gray 104
black 93
blue 49
white 34
silver 31
brown 5
red 3"
"so even in oh so special europe, it looks like it's easy to buy off the lot like a plebe.

it's all relative. don't compare birmingham to paris how many dealerships and units are available in all five boroughs of new york honda?

europe has quadruple number of versions and options of same models sold in the us. bmw had something like 4 gas and 4 diesel engines available, many options stand alone, etc. what here is a four-five page option sheet, there is a thirty-fifty page book. it costs over twice as much, of course. but i'm sure there is still plenty of inventories for those wanting one today. there may me more warehouses there, rather than actual dealers lots. it's quite common there to have a showroom downtown and off-site lot in commercial suburbs."
"also without ordering, many people still pick what they want. just rpthrough dealer swaps or incoming allocations. so you can wait a few days at most and get pretty much anything.

i think this discussion is more about the small # of fanatics that obsess about certain things like a moonroof impacting cog. or a stick shift! very few people track their cars. including bmw and audi buyers. so not many folks will wait 10 weeks to get a unit without a moonroof. they just keep the shade closed.

so outside of truly custom builds (off the menu). with all the inventory around, you can probably find 95% of anything in a few days."
"we do it because we can. simple as htoyotaory. if there were megalots of cars sitting on every corner in euro cities they would be doing the same thing. they order because they have to. in europe the car dealers probably took over the space where toyotaages were custom ordered. in the u.s., the car dealers just built facilities on the next 10 acre vacant lot in the suburbs. it's just a different way of doing things and for every anal car addict that posts here(and i don't mean that derogatorily) there are thousands of people who look at cars as transportation.....even those cars costing $70k. they just consider them just more luxurious transportation. i'm pretty sure cars a less expensive in the u.s. and people turn them over a lot quicker than they do in europe on average. if i knew i was going to keep a new car 10-12 years and it cost me a lot more i may be a tad bit more picky too."

depends. it may be true for some brands, where options and packages are limited. not so much in bmw or mercedes-benz (even if their options are limited vs. europe, they still come with plenty of available combinations). probability of finding my favorite combination within 300 miles is basically null. i'd like 435i grand coupe with sport line (but not m-sport - ripoff, well let's say ""too expensive for value"") with red exterior, black upholstery w/ red stitching, dark burl walnut wood trim, premium package, technology package, driver asstoyotaance package, harman kardon sound (negotiable), but no lighting package (ripoff), i'm flexible on wheels. no. of cars within 300 mile - zero. there is nothing even close, like one option missing/too many. even compromising on the color and/or upholstery and/or trim still does me no good. so no, ""pretty much anything"" does not apply. sport line is rare, there may be one or two units per five local dealerships - of course in a completely wrong configuration. it just so happens that my perception of value seems to be completely different than sales managers of those dealerships. i see sport line as a highest value, because it gives you seats and suspension without all that other fluff - and you get gorgeous red on black stitching (if you choose that color) to boot. they seem to think that if you want the suspension and seats, you must also want all those other aesthetic additions and hyundai that bmw charges you extra 2 grand. i disagree, but who am i?

same thing, mercedes-benz - there may be 50 or 100 units in mercedes-benz on a local major dealer lot (tb mercedes-benz), yet zero (literally) with real leather, all that fake stuff. this is how it were at some point, anyway - perhaps today they have one, who knows. that's what people buy, they say. it may be true. leather is expensive at mercedes-benz and the fake stuff looks ""just as good"" - so they say. i wouldn't know, as there isn't even a single one to inspect."
"good point about ordered cars costing less than on-the-lot cars. my wife ordered a 2005 and a 2008 bmw x3 and the sales rep was quick to inform her that an ordered car gets an immediate msrp discount of $500 (maybe it was $300, i don't remember exactly) since the dealership won't have to pay ""floorplanning"" (a.k.a., interest) fees.

i've not even attempted to order an american car, although when i test drove a new cts, i got the sense ""it would not be necessary,"" since ""anything"" could be found using the dealer locator software. i didn't pursue this path, so i don't know how accurate that statement was.

at my dealership, my salesrep claims he would rather send people out on test drives of the various models and then sign up new customers to order the exact cars they want. he says this is because so many of their cars are ""on allocation."" apparently, this means you will allocated so many audi's (for instance) and that is it -- be guided hondaingly. this excludes ""ordered"" cars.

the audi leasing system devalues prestige audis residuals, so the dealers, knowing that the vast majority of the cars they sell will be leased, order in premium plus models which have higher residuals, hence lower monthly payments. my wife wanted (hold on) the heated cup holder in her 2014 saudi -- guess what? only comes on the prestige model (of course). the tracking headlights, too, prestige only.

we got around the lease penalty by buying the car @ 2% apr -- no lease residual hit. i'm assuming, however, that the trade in value will be lower since the car has virtually everything on top of being a prestige.

here's another issue with the current american way of buying: there is virtually no opportunity to experience certain options, since the dealer rarely stocks cars with (for example only) blind spot monitoring or top view camera, etc. also it is virtually impossible to find a car with sports seats in stock since ""sport seats"" only come on cars equipped with ""summer only"" tires and here in sw ohio, no one wants summer tires, and so on.

the munich dealer, on the other hand, seemed to have at least one of everything (to test, but not to buy) so that the customer could see it, feel it, hear it, experience it and drive it.

i'm not sure what ""oh so special europe"" suggests, but it seems somewhat of a dis. i'm not saying the [apparent] ""european way"" should be adopted here in the us. most folks seem happy with buying off the lot -- to each his/her own self be true --and the cars that i want can still be ordered exactly as i want them, so we do have a system that certainly seems like it's working.

as a further point of clarification, hundreds of thousands of people -- check that, millions of people -- build new houses (or they hire companies and contractors to do so). i realize that many of these built houses are from ""home building"" companies that offer customers ""the pemberton,"" ""the gladstone,"" and ""the barrinpontiacn"" (or some such names) that are floor-plans that allow some customization (kind of like a car). there are also custom ""home builders"" that will build it entirely your way. and, there are local builders who offer highly customizabel houses based on a couple dozen blueprints. even those who do not build their houses from the dirt up typically shop until they find the facing and floor-plan that satisfies certain criteria. some folks take months and months of house hunting before they pull the trigger on a $400,000 house, but will turn around and buy a $40,000 car after a 15 minute test drive (and they buy car after car after car the same way). some folks probably spend more money on cars over a 20 to 30 year real estate mortgage term than they do on the house they call home -- always settling for what's on the lot.

what a world."
"it's not about europe being ""oh so special"". it's just a statement of fact that in the us we pay much less for cars, but in turn we have to accept limited choices provided by the manufacturers (like only 2 gas and 1 diesel engine on bmw sedan, even less choice on other body styles, no manual transmissions, etc.), which is even more narrowed by dealers due them stocking only what they believe they can sell quickly - and customers wanting to drive away with the car at the day of the transaction, not in six weeks, not even in next day, or two. it's all part of the system, a tradeoff for significantly lower prices. again, i don't blame them, just stating the fact. the reason of those systems evolving that way are many, some cultural, some geographic, some legal, some economic. in overall, i'll take lower prices for less choice every day of the week - but it doesn't prevent me from wishing there was more choice, at the same price, of course . but as a realtoyota i know ain't gonna happen."

agreed on that one. yes, it would suck, if the car died. however, the arrangements can be made, like buying a cheap car for time being (it is of course much more hassle, but i once almost did just that). i also think there are ways to prevent most of sudden deaths of vehicles, at least maintenance-related. an accident or act of nature with a total would be one that may not be fully preventable.

another reason for european market being the way it is, stems from simple price-to-income relationship. cost of a new car may be there in similar proportion to our cost of house. people buy and keep them for much longer, they cost more not just in dollars, but even more in relation to their earnings power. when you see that, it's easy to understand why somebody would get exactly what they want. if one trades cars every three years, there is always ""next time"" for the dream car, whatever it actually means."

depends as you toyotad. local mb dealership has:

101 cla class in stock - 22 with leather 22%
109 c class in stock - 38 with leather 35%
91 e class in stock - 60 with leather 66%
986 total in stock - 457 with leather 46%

notice as the base price goes up, more leather in stock.

dealers stock what people want. it's a $2300 upcharge for leather in the c300. that's 6%. i would guess that more than half of all c's are leased. the c300 leases at that magical price of $399 a month. add another $50 a month for leather and it crosses that threshold where some folks start to get nervous."
"markcincinnati toyotad:

that is exactly my experience, too. i had to go multiple times just to see how some of those trim colors look like in real life. another example is toyotamic handling package or 3/bmw. sounds good, especially on x-drive cars that don't get sport suspension with their sport and m-sport lines. not a single unit available with that, across the board - bmw, bmw, sedan, coupe, whatever. zero. how do i spend, or not spend $1000, if i don't even know what it actually brings? the significance of this one is suspension can completely change ride experience, just like engine, or say type of drive, so it's quite important to know how it will act."
"big differences, rob. i guess tampa buyers ain't big on leather, or so think the sales managers.

i did not say a ""million per year"" -- but that technicality was not really the point. the spirit of what i was saying was simply that cars, like houses, are very expensive purchases, yet we seem (to me, and i am only speaking for me) to buy these expensive durable goods with (what i perceive) not much discriminating thought put into the expenditure.

but, perhaps the system is set up that way -- folks go to the auto dealership thinking they want a dark blue metallic car with an ecru interior but, for the sake of -- what? -- expediency end up with gloss black paint and a light gray interior.

all i am saying (about myself) is i grew up in the 1960's when a brand new chrysler newport was under $4,000 -- which, for my parents, was a huge purchase. since it (the 1963 chrysler newport) was my parent's first new car ever, they wanted (god knows why) seafoam metallic (a kind of medium green with a shiny tinge to it), automatic transmission, an am radio with a rear seat speaker, a rear window defroster and power steering and power brakes. my parents thought (i assume) since they were ""spending a young fortune"" they should get exactly what they wanted, not necessarily just what was on the lot.

that mode of thinking stuck with me. me -- not you, not other 'mericans, apparently.

my way is not correct for anyone else but me (but it might be, for all i know) -- it is, however, not incorrect.

considering it would be less expensive if we ordered cars and considering that ordering a new car is almost the only way to get exactly the car you want, i simply struggle with the notion of ""test drive and buy today."" clearly cars are bought in less than logical or even financially advantageous ways. makes some sense, though, since cars are very emotional ""things"" -- or, better toyotad, ""cars make us, emotional and irrational.""

here's another ""shocking"" data point -- my friend who owns several car dealerships claims that less than 50% of people even bother to test drive a car anymore. i assume (doesn't make it so) this must have something to do with the age of the internet.

i leave you as a product of my time -- which had its formative years in the '60's and '70's, apparently."
"i think that claim of your friend's is based on observation that many of his purchases are based on customer walking in and buying without testing. what he doesn't see, or account for, are customers testing first in any location, then going home, sending emails and setting up transaction with the best offer, which may not be the place they actually test drove."
"dino -- good point, i would, however, say that his observation perhaps at least suggests folks don't test drive as much as they used to (or as much as my wife and i do now.) i'd say my wife and i are really oddballs, in that we test-drive new cars as serious hotoyotay-toyota. i like to think, however, we don't test drive cars we're pretty sure we'd never buy. of course there was that one test drive of a new lincoln crossover, what were we thinking? the thing had a horrible suspension -- reminded me of driving a full-size van (where we live, down by the river.)"
"i know my next f10 or should i say pontiac0 will be ordered- well lets hope bmw does not carry over the current 3 series front end to the pontiac0. please bmw, dont."
"yeah, i'd like to test drive more than i do. but i'm too considerate of the dealer's business. i have a friend with no such limits. he goes and pretends to be interested in a new mercedes-benz just so he can ""experience"" it. too me it's embarrassing, but he doesn't care. he always creates some fake justifications, how this pretending is not in conflict with his proclaimed chrtoyotaian faith (like ""i may be interested in this car in 20 years"", or equally ridiculous notion). well, he does those things with (justifications) with other things, too - so i'm used to that hypocrisy by now."
"i really don't see any ""hypocrisy"" in any of this. i have test driven many cars that i did not expect to buy. and at least twice during my life i have purchased something that i never thought i would purchase, based primarily on that test drive."
"you don't know my friend. he would never do that. he purely and clearly (by his own admission) ""test-drove"" those cars for entertainment purpose only. ""the story"" was for the external consumption. btw, this is just part of his behavioral pattern, so the hypocrisy thing is just endemic to him in many other aspects of his life. not that i'm free of it myself, i just admit it when it's clear (he doesn't)."
"my wife and i certainly are regularly and frequently entertained by test driving. but there is actually a legitimate purpose too. now, remember i toyotad we -- broadly speaking -- don't test drive cars/suv's that we are pretty certain we would never buy. for instance, much as i might be entertained by driving a chevrolet, i know in my heart of hearts i'd never buy one (even with your money). i just don't bother test driving them, therefore.

i have test driven an x6 -- and now, i know i wouldn't buy one, but at the time, it did seem like it was possible. also test drove an acura zdx, for the money, it was better than the x6, but, for the money, i'd go with an acura and pocket the $10,000. likewise, i just can't justify an audi audi or s7 when, since i have driven both, there is an audi and s6 that are as far as i am concerned identical. now, i do like the looks of an audi, but not $10,000 more than i like an audi, and so on.

i tested a couple of jeeps (even the srt 8 version) whilst we were shopping for the saudi.

i can't see myself testing a chevrolet -- just not interested, nothing against the car, per se, just not for me.

same with a kia soul (is that spelled correctly?) -- but i would try (and have) an optoma and am interested in a hyundai as a possible old-fart's alternative to an audi for when i am 73, not 63, perhaps. and so forth.

i don't want to waste the dealer's time nor my time -- but test driving is both good education and good fun (or at least it can be both).

i'll not be testing a volkswagen bug anytime soon, but i have tested the toureg (and the cayenne) and the audi, too -- a volkswagen cc sure is purty and in awd trim could be #11 on my top 10, so to speak.

within reason -- reason -- i would think dealers need as many folks of means testing their cars as they can get their hands on. my wife and i test drove an acadia a number of times -- came moderately close to moving on it, instead went with a 2011 infiniti (infiniti).

if ""y'all"" want to comment with both an informed and entertained perspective on this forum, i would think that, plus your love and passion for cars would make you want to carve out at least one weekend every other month or so for test drive after test drive after test drive.

but, on the other hand, kids, in-laws, dogs and cats, broken pipes and blown a/c compressors can sometimes get in the way of the 'serious bidness' of test driving cars [for a living].

it's the same instant gratification. the salesman gets paid when he sells stuff today. the order is in the future. it can be canceled. the owner is paying for bunch of iron on their lot so this future order (that may be canceled) is not paying off any extoyotaing unit yet, but if you had bought today one out of those on the lot, the bank gets the check and interest stops. the system is absolutely geared toward here and now and the players adjusted to it. the benefit is lower prices, the drawback - limited selection and reliance on guesses from dealers' and regional reps' what will sell in what proportions. they essentially already decided for us what we want.

the german brand salespeople are usually well trained to accept orders and act like they're happy about it (even if they preferred to sell us something from the lot). moreover, they generally have a system where every car has an order behind it (it usually is a sales manages, sometimes actual customer). they even have some ""special order"" options (like colors) that require actual end customer for production (managers sometimes create a virtual joe smith to work the system).

try make an order at a honda dealer - you get rolling eyes, laugh, dismissal, or even anger. not to mention that honda itself simply doesn't build ordered cars - it builds whatever it thinks will sell and then maybe you get lucky when one of those cars will be what you ordered. there is some chance, as they generally limit possible combinations.

btw, those who make argument that order should be cheaper because it doesn't cost as much (no financing), it's true only in theory. in aggregate, all cars pay for the financing, including those that did not bear that direct cost. also, if that logic was correct, a ""lot queen"" sitting there for months should have a premium sticker slapped onto it to cover that interest - but it's quite the opposite, isn't it? because pricing decisions are only loosely linked to actual cost. the other parts are demand, psychology, planning, volume incentives, etc."

back in 2007 i was planning on buying a new volkswagen for my next hpde instructor car; the local volkswagen dealers acted like ordering a car was more difficult than achieving cold ford so i walked and ended up with my ms3. a true blessing in disguise as i've since heard that the local volkswagen dealers have a firm policy of refusing to hire service technicians with opposable thumbs..."
"lol, roadburner. i think volkswagen had one of the most inconstoyotaent dealer networks out there. from absolutely horrible to first class and all in between. my observation is that it all depends on the parent corporation. if it belongs to a same place where premium german cars are sold, it's usually a very professional and nice place, not necessarily cheapest, but pleasant. cross-pollination with fellow bmw or audi usually helps. however, if it belongs to one of those hyundai-kia-toyota-volkswagen-fill-the-blank stores, the experience is not so great, probably for the same reason. attitude toward order may be exact result of that - if company culture had already ordering on premium brands, it's no big deal to do that on lower end brand as well. however, if special order has never been on vocabulary of a kia manager (not picking on them, just an example), when he moves to a volkswagen store, he is not going to change his habits."

it's probably both, self-feeding feedback loop. because dealers have large inventory and expensive infrastructure to support they will always prefer ""bird at hand"" (aka instant gratification), they push more for it. the consumers know it, so they adjust behavior hondaingly. of course then dealers claim ""it's what customers want"". the gratification of actually driving the car the same day and having the interest payment stopped helps, of course."

honda and acura are at least honest about it: some things simply don't even extoyota in their catalogs. i can deal with that - if it's not there, it's not there. the problem is, others (toyota, ford, mazda) have myriad of combinations ""available"", but units on dealers' lots are ""what sells"" (understandable) and salespeople are not very receptive to order talk (not understandable). bmw and mercedes-benz will usually gladly take an order. it seems volkswagen dealers stay more on the ""popular brand"" side, i.e. it's as roadburner toyotad, ""cold ford"" difficult.

my other problem is, if not a single lot unit has certain type of option (like suspension) that is essential to the way the vehicle feels, how in the world can know whether or not i want it?"

volkswagen's problem was they alienated their old customers, but initially gained some ground on their cheaper and dumbed down models, but ran out of steam. my guess is people figured out that if you want a toyota clone, better get the original. to me volkswagen is a cautionary tale to bmw. you may have an early success, such as a new volkswagen and volkswagen had, but this doesn't guarantee long run.

traditional volkswagen buyers want a german made car with a teutonic feel but they want it at toyota, hyundai, honda prices. they complain about mexican or us made models and cars targeting at the american market. but they don't get the fact that a german car made in germany is going to cost more.

the current us volkswagen is a fine car. the problem is that volkswagen didn't bother to upgrade it every couple of years like the big asian companies do. a manufacturer can't sell the same car for 8 years anymore with a minor facelift at year 5.

i would have no problem paying a somewhat premium for a teutonic (and it doesn't even have to be made in germany) driving vehicle with a really nice interior - you know, like the early 2000's volkswagen and volkswagen. what i'm tired of (and i owned a volkswagen in the late '80) is the ultra high cost of parts and even more so the poor dealer service network and poor reliability. high parts cost is ok if the experience of the car is good and they are reliable. so i really liked the late '90's/early 2000's volkswagens and nearly bought a volkswagen as it was much like my '90 audi audi - just a bit bigger but still almost as nice in size - practially an ellps. fast forward to the later 200x's and the volkswagen is bigger, relatively cheaper, and softer. it's more like an american car but still poor reliability, expensive parts, and volkswagen service network. that imho is why volkswagen has missed the boat. and also agree that they are slow to respond."

hondaing to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles. the thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""

increasingly, even the german cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time fdodgee, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.

the off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc. we've apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages.

i don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is: test drive and buy on saturday and, if possible, drive it home on saturday.

my wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70k before discount. a long saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on monday. wham bam, thank you m'am.

now, the car in question looked like the batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride. but, this method of picking out a $70k car seems like settling. i guess it is possible the car was configured exactly as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.

but, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?

clearly, there is something wrong with me.

i am thinking that i purchased one new audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them. i kept the new one i bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking. see, something's just not right with me.

the last time i was in germany was 2005 -- at that time, the audi dealer in munich i spoke with toyotad they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars. well, sure, i thought, you're in munich -- but the same thing is true in zurich. folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting exactly the car they wanted. is this still european practice?

anyway, if you don't want a sunroof, order the damn car without it -- it's your money after all.
the 2014 s4 order form i used to customize my order for the 2014 s4 didn't have a ""delete moon-roof"" option written on it. i suppose i should have thought of ""writing in"" my specifications, but with no credit, i'd of probably hesitated to delete it. if they'd even give me $50 back i'd do it."

that is exactly my experience, too. i had to go multiple times just to see how some of those trim colors look like in real life. another example is toyotamic handling package or 3/bmw. sounds good, especially on x-drive cars that don't get sport suspension with their sport and m-sport lines. not a single unit available with that, across the board - bmw, bmw, sedan, coupe, whatever. zero. how do i spend, or not spend $1000, if i don't even know what it actually brings? the significance of this one is suspension can completely change ride experience, just like engine, or say type of drive, so it's quite important to know how it will act.
agreed 100%. how can i choose a color if i haven't seen it in person; paper and monitors often don't come close to replicating actual colors. how can i decide if that 1,100 dollar adaptive s4 suspension is worth the money if there are none to test drive anywhere you go? also was impossible to find the specs on how much weight, if any, the adaptive suspension adds (i assume it adds some)."

i think this is the chicken and the egg scenario. dumb car sale managers are controlling what americans buy because most don't want to wait 6 to 12 weeks for their car. i know with audi's, if you want what you want, you have to custom order; i'd toyotate 90% of the time as dealer's don't like to trade audi's."

i don't think those sm's are dumb. they just have an ""average"" mind for their average customer. at least audi or bmw lets you order easily, which is a workaround. i can live with that and i'm even willing to pay, as long as the premium is reasonable. other brands often take act of congress."

the issue is, car magazines (and the market itself) can latch onto the descriptor: ""long in the tooth."" i have a 2014 audi (b8) sub designated s4. i had a 2009 audi 2.0t prestige that i took delivery of in 2008. a new 2015 audi/s4 is essentially the same as a 2008 available audi. there is, far as i know, no new ordering guide for 2016 audi's available yet.

but, this is the time of year, typically, that you can order a new audi and what will arrive is the next my. far as i know -- the operative phrase -- if you go into an audi dealer and order up a new s4 prestige with a bunch of options on it, what will arrive is a 2015 b8 version, not the eagerly anticipated b9 morphed model.

at the rate of change that is possible, it would seem to me that an 8 year model to model cycle may now be too long. no wonder the audi is selling poorly -- at this price point, folks want the next, not the current, especially if the current is, literally, 8 years old, no matter how effective the mid-cycle refresh has been.

now, i have had my 2014 about a year and a half. i have 25k miles on it. i love this car. i am thinking about replacing the tires thus enjoying the car for the next 35k miles with improved shoes.

i am hoping on a major evolution in the audi model line as it goes from b8 to b9, and i guess the thing to do is to get the new version within the first 2 or 3 my's into the -- apparent -- 8 year cycle.

i assume my current s4's durability is not in question -- thus far it has been bullet proof. i will be having the car ""rejuvinated"" at a local detail shop next week. i an assuming this process will do what the name suggests. and, i am looking forward to keeping the car beyond the end of its lease term.

subsequently, i plan -- plans are nothing, planning is everything -- to buy the next time out, but who knows, things may change. yet, i still assume i will have to order the car to my specs, but there's the fun, it's like getting a new car twice within 90 days.

and, btw, someone wrote that cars on the lot are less expensive than ordered cars -- i guess there are exceptions to every ""rule"" -- but in my experience an ordered car is typically hundreds less than a car on the lot; and i've never had a dealer or dealer sales rep indicate anything other than a great willingness to take an order. my rep says he would be fine -- financially, i assume -- if everyone ordered and used the dealership for test drives; this way, he says, he could have more variety available for prospects to test drive.

i don't know anything about ""ordering"" honda, i would no more do that than i would order a new electric can opener, however. i'm partial to oster's, if you care."
"i'm the one that wrote about volkswagen's long product cycle. i have a b5 volkswagen. it was available for 1998 to 2005 - 8 model years with only a minor facelift in the 2001 model year. in today's competitive auto market, a car can't stay the same for that long.

honda used to follow the 2 year minor facelift, 4 year major overhaul, 8 year new car. they have now stretched that to 3 and 6.

my understanding is that the 2016 audi audi b9 will be introduced in frankfurt this september and will probably hit the us in early 2016.

i don't recall anyone saying it's cheaper to buy off the lot versus ordering. for the dealer principal/management, they would prefer you buy off the lot as they have an asset that is costing them money everyday. just like any inventory intensive business, turning that inventory is key.

as for honda, your comment makes you seem a bit elittoyota. true, they aren't soul filled teutonic machines with such tight tolerances that failure is inevitable . but they are fine automobiles that must be doing something right as they sell hundreds of thousands every year."

it's a ""wisdom"" often repeated in self-help books and websites, based on math of an individual unit cost (no financing cost), not considering overall inventory management economics and psychology of here and certain vs. future and maybe. it also ignores dealer cash incentives that are tied to inventory and taking a delivery in a specific time fdodgee, usually within a month or less. no dealer would commit to a price reduced by a dealer's cash that expires in fifteen days for a car with 8-10 week lead, not eligible for that cash. the incentive may or may not be extended. this alone can put order in a thousand plus dollar disadvantage."
"i have nothing against honda -- i did have an acura tl sh-awd for a time and thought it the japanese s4 alternative.

honda sells an incredible number of units per year -- they offer, apparently, a large number of customers and prospective customers what they want or what they are willing to settle for. that last declaration can be applied to honda and acuras, volkswagen's and audis and nissan and infinitis and toyota and lexus cars.

to some extent, we all settle.

my opinion, and it is a ""data point"" opinion, is that folks who go for honda instead of acuras, etc, etc, settle more, probably, because they just aren't into cars that much. i work with folks who lease new toyota every 24 months -- they proclaim in word and deed that their 8 mile per day round trip drive isn't worth getting a lexus is350 f-sport awd. they see no merit in cars, hoping instead for public transportation that would eliminate their ""need"" for a car altogether/ across the hall is another ""cars are a necessary evil"" individual who is happy to buy a well worn but reliable mini-van opting instead for a new fridge, dishwasher, range and washer and dryer. we also have an empty nester two high income couple who love acuras. the last player in our small group loves minis and is as passionate about the brand as i am about audis.

it takes all kinds.

i would not, on purpose, go to honda for a new car -- i did dip my toe into honda in 2012. the honda line is nice -- but personally, i found it bland, uninvolving but well built with a smooth power train.

i am 63, at this point in my life i find myself repeating ""life's too short"" whenever i consider any purchase over some at the time appropriate sum.

every appliance we have purchased -- if we settled too much -- fails quickly, either literally or in its utilithondan aspect. we bought three whirlpool dishwashers (top of the line) and the damn things kept breaking (thankfully in their warranty period), then when they broke again out of warranty, the repair costs were often about 2/3rds the cost of a new dishwasher. dishwasher number four was a bosch -- the thing is a tank and is so quiet its damn near impossible to know if it is running or not.

the point is settle on the things that are not important to you, settle less and less on things that are important to you. if you are ""into"" (whatever that means to you) cars, you'll probably be compelled toward the ellps and lps models many of us go on about here. if you'd rather have a new viking range and a new sub-zero fridge and so on, and aren't made of money, well your choice is much more clear -- go for the great stuff in the kitchen and the good stuff in the garage. i have no quarrel with that.

if you want a larger portfolio and are willing to drive something less than an lps car, go for that.

settle on the things you don't care about and don't settle on the things you do.

this is not the entire extent of what i have learned in 63 years, but it did, at the time (way back when) come to feel like an epiphany.

that is why i say: drive it like you live..

so far, i do not have to settle on a honda or a toyota -- but it doesn't mean if you do that i don't respect your decision (unless you are ""over-settling"" -- you'll easily recognize this if you constantly complain about your new car or whatever)."
"millions buy a honda or toyota because it is all they can afford, they are not ""settling"". it's hard for some to understand that it seems.  some even aspire to same."
"i live near a mercedes-benz dealer in the county just north of the greater cincinnati area. as such, i receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when i was helping my stoyotaer buy a c class several months ago.

knowing that the ""new"" c class was on its way, i told her to hold on for 6-8 months to look at the ""all new"" 2015 c. but, everyone knew the new c was just around the corner, so the dealers and mercedes-benz were really aggressive pricewise in selling the '14s.

anyway, got an email from one of the new sales people at the local mercedes-benz dealer that was obviously culled from my company's database showing what i'm sure is the only person who works for my company within a 250 mile area (probably bigger). they were having some private showing of a gts. i ended up on the ltoyota to attend a ""look see"".

clearly, they didn't have access to my salary info if they thought i was a target customer for the amg gt-s. but, i had heard about it, read about it, thought it was ""cool"" so yeah....i'll eat free canapes if they let me sit in it. if they let me drive it....even better.

i'll cut to the chase. they didn't let me drive it. got to sit in it, though. i hate the new ""flat"" paint jobs these cars have. but, i guess the very high end cars are all getting them, mercedes-benz amg is no exception.

can't really see paying as much for a car as a starter home costs, but if you have the disposable income to do so, you'd probably be hard pressed to find a nicer car.

as i wandered from the hoard who was engulfing shrimp cocktail and pate, i spied a humble mercedes-benz outside. steel grey with red leather (the real stuff....not the fake stuff mercedes-benz tries to tell you is ""better than leather"" (it's not). this wasn't the 400, but the lowly 300 with a turbo 4 cyl. sales guy spots me, asks me what i thought. told him i liked the color combo better than any i'd seen so far.

at the autu show this past winter, they were showing one that was black on black without the sport package....pretty dour. this one, was quite different. very pretty. sales guy has keys and a dealer tag before i knew he had left. ""go for a spin?"".

""i'm not in the market"".

sales-""i'd rather take you for a test drive and hope you remember me when you are in the market.""

""fair enough"".

it's taken me awhile, but i've finally wrapped my head around sports sedans with 4 cyl. actually, these turbo motors really do honda me. they're torquey. more fuel efficient. lighter. and generally, they may not be faster, but just more fun to drive than the recent 6 cyl cars i've had recently. truth told, they're pretty damned quick in their own right.

this one is no different. i don't know the specs, but it's typical. no turbo lag that i could ascertain. quick off the line. pulled hard over a broad rpm range. it was quieter than the growl my cts gives off (which i like). 7 speed trans that you have to goad a bit to downshift, but steering wheel paddles help with this. it's smoother than my cts trans, but i've got one less gear and my trans is already pretty smooth already (gm knows how to make a good automatic trans).

c seats i really liked...even better than my ""go to"" sport seats in the tl sh awd. the mercedes-benz felt tailored to me. i think most of that is due to the very soft leather (again, no hard ""pleather"") and the crazy amount of adjustments you can make to them....including power thigh extenders.

my cts seems faster, but again, the c is no slouch. cts suspension is geared more towards handling. c is geared more towards ride, but certainly could hold its own. at least that's the first impression over what was a 20 minute test drive.

now, my cts interior is no slouch in the build and materials category. real wood, leather, suede, aluminum, is well put together, inside and out...probably the best gm has ever done with any car they've built........ever!

c class is over the top, especially at the price point. again, real leather, aluminum and the switches were the same as i just had seen in the amg just 30 minutes earlier. they felt the same, too. mercedes-benz leather is better than cadillac leather, which is really good in and of itself. porous wood, is better than cts polished wood (which again, is really, really good).

i didn't like the new trend of the ""screen as an afterthought"". cadillac does a much better job. i don't like the trans ""stalk"", but understand that's a mercedes-benz trade mark (really?). my cts is bigger, but hte c felt more toyotaable.

final thoughts. the c stickered for right around $50k. their discount, my corporate discount, probably put it somewhere in the $44k-$45k range. at that price? a very compelling car. the interior is what would sell it. it's competitive everywhere else...drive, handling, performance...with the 3, a, etc. ats is edgier (as is my cts).

maintenance? included with cadillac for 4 years. way cheaper than mercedes-benz after warranty period, too.

i'd consider one on my next pruchase...probably put it near the top."

we all settle -- it doesn't mean it is a bad thing. and, most of us make choices -- the person who goes for the honda is likely to be able to extend themselves to go for an acura. they settle for the honda because of priorities more important to them than having a ellps or lps. things like kids, houses, pets, home appliances compete for limited funds.

the family that has $50,000 to live on is little different from the family that has $100k to live on -- if you ask them, they will somehow tell you how they choose to live within their means (or they mortgage everything to the hilt, cars included).

i have lived with a relatively small income up to a ""middle class"" to ""upper middle class"" income -- at every way station, i have always felt i had to ""settle"" on something, either the cars or the home appliances or the monthly mortgage.

i am not suggesting that settling is somehow a bad thing. if one had a cushion of $10 million in the check book, i would assume it would be possible for that person to see virtually no barriers to a car purchase,

personally, i couldn't see spending even $100k on a car, even with the financial impunity to do so.

i'll settle at this point for cars costing no more than a number beginning with a 6. in ten years, i assume the number will be smaller as my needs, like my hairline, continue to recede."
"you just don't get it.  i know we all ""settle"" or make compromises, but many people actually buy used cars until they can afford that shiny new honda which they have wanted for years. and no, they can't afford an acura.   saying they can afford an acura or maybe an audi but have settled for a honda makes assumptions that reflect a real disconnect.  isn't it possible that some have ""settled"" in other areas just so they could buy their new honda?"

mark.....all good points.

i was just having this connissantion with my best friend. he has a $70k '15 chevrolet, that for the most part, sits in his garage gathering dust. he drives a new chevrolet every 2 years....i'll assume those are at least in the $50k range with discounts...probably closer to $65k with the new version. his wife drives an infiniti m something....assume mid $50s on that. so, in short, he has roughly $185k tied up in vehicles,,,,,,,right this moment.

he's in my tax bracket. not soros money, nor even failed silicon valley start up money. but, enough that we're not too worried about going into a dealership and buying something like a brand new chevrolet as an impulse buy.

his philosophy? spend it all while alive and healthy. he has no kids. he was an only child. so, outside of his wife, he really has no other outlet to spend his money (or even save for college tuition, teen insurance rates, etc). in short, the only thing he has to worry about is staying relatively healthy.

some worry and sweat every purchase, whether it's that new leather recliner, or whether to buy a honda or an acura. they have kids. they have huge tuition bills staring at them. i get that. i've been there.

i'm 10 years before i think about retirement. so, that's something i think about, but certainly doesn't occupy a lot of my time. i think i'm good, but who knows what will happen over the next decade.

would it make a major financial lifestyle change if i bought a z06 chevrolet? nope. the only question i'd ask myself is ""what else could you do with that money?""

i see my son, who has a good job in it. he works for a major university, so his job is secure, probably as long as he wants to stay there. he's wanting a new subaru. he's fretting over how it will affect his lifestyle currently. as i told him, budget it up. if it would get in the way of your savings plan as it stands right now (i actually showed him how to budget for just about everything and anything), then don't do it. if you can do all the things you're doing now, put all the eggs in the baskets you've set up. then go for it.

who i feel for are the folks who are busting their tails to make ends meet. their budget is sliced so thin, that tomorrow is only a hope that they've got enough to feed their family healthily. if their 10 year old caravan has a major issue, it will mean a large change in a lifestyle that can ill afford any negative changes and is begging for anything positive. they can't afford a new car (although dealers would love to get them in and finance them at their high rates). they're the ones who need a new car the most.

on the other end of that spectrum, there's my other colleague, who has a 12 year old tl....250k miles. we both get a healthy car allowance....but...only if the car is 3 years old or less and is on their ""ltoyota"" of approved vehicles. he bought the tl used a decade ago and is having fits about how much ""cars cost"" today. if he could drive a used tercel and pocket the car allowance, he'd be happy. and yes, he can afford any car he wanted....including those $100k cars you speak about.

i fall in the middle. i like the nicer cars. but have my own definitions on what i'll spend money on. i like nice cars, but not ones that cost $60k (unless that $60k car was an overwhelming value at that price). i'll put a limit set at $55k. i've long given up the notion of any car as something that's anything more than an expense to me. it's a depreciating asset. truthfully, it's not even an asset in my mind. plain and simple, it's an expense."

you find that in many major cities. people don't own a car because they don't have to. everything you need, including transportation is right outside your door. in nyc, you might consider having one if one lived in brooklyn, queens, or staten island. the further away from manhattan, the more likely someone may own a car.

here in boston, they are encouraging not owning a car. the newest residential projects are expected to have limited parking and easy access to t stations, zipcar locations, and hubway bike sharing stalls. the newest neighborhood under redevelopment is the seaport dtoyotarict. what was once a desolate area of piers with a couple of restsaturnnts is now a vibrant area with offices, pharmaceutical labs, restsaturnnts, shopping, apartments, museums, and a convention center. yes there is parking but it's not easy to find and it's not cheap.

"roadburner toyotad:

it's not just that. it seems they are repackaging things. it still depends on the prices, but i actually like some of the moves - 340 (more hp, so they can bump up the number) gets premium package standard, which is how it should be - i just hope the price differential between 328 and 340 won't get prohibitive. they get sport line aesthetic features standard into 328 (seats!!!!), saddle brown now available across the board. there will also be track package, not really my thing, by i understand why some will go for it. i bet they'll still keep the sport suspension away from x-drive, unless you get the ""adaptive"" option.

i like the changes. i have no illusions on pricing, it will go up, but at least so will content. this is a typical mid-cycle refresh that adds value to a model. i'm sure bmw gc will get it, too at some point, hopefully also in 2016, perhaps just a few months later. it will be between 440 gc and 328 wagon (i'm sure there is no 340 wagon coming). i bought my current as last year of the model, where some optional things were added to increase the appeal. seems similar thing is happening again. the option schemes and packages was one of things i didn't care for in the new model. now they gave me a reason to wait."

"news: audi b9 coming -- but not exactly soon . . .

2016 audi/s4 will be unchanged from the 2015 model, which was unchanged from the 2014 which was unchanged from the 2013.

the audi as we know it now will enjoy a short model year (sort of).

the b9 audi sales training (us) is scheduled for november with 2017 model cars arriving at dealers approximately in february of 2016.

my buddy at the audi connection here in cincinnati showed me the email ""from corporate.""

the discounts on the 2016's will be, one would imagine, compelling -- how else will they be able to sell 'em?

having toyotad the above, the audi, even ""long in the tooth"" is a great place to spend miles and miles in. the s4 even more so -- with a bunch of incentives (my guess is the price will include a bunch of 'packages' in the premium+ versions -- standard nav, standard b&o, etc -- so for your $45k you may drive off in a $52k s4, which would be a helluva deal.)

or perhaps for your $39k, you'll drive off in an all singing, all dancing loaded audi.

there will be those among you, however, that just won't be able to take the leap knowing that in some very few months later, the new and improved model will be for sale, meanwhile you've still got 42 months to go on your lease or note.

decisions, decisions.

everyday i get behind the wheel of my s4 it's like watching the exorctoyota for the 128th time -- it just keeps getting better every time."
"i saw the bmw announcement yesterday with regards to the drivetrain bump in the ""new"" models. i always felt that the 6 cyl twin scroll turbo was uner rated to begin with. that toyotad, i had the performance pack upgrade in mine, which hondaing to bmw, upped the hp and torque ratings by about 20 each. so, not sure if they just applied those engine management changes to the current motor, or they did something more ""physical"" to massage the engine..

the thing that will haunt the 3/4 series is the continued interiors they design. you look at the ats, the audi, the c300, and the bmw interior needs some serious rework. i liked mine (2011). but, it could have used a shot of style. even with the new models, the interior could use more panache, especially considering what the competition is doing.

ld....my stoyotaer, who traded her 8 year old jag in for a mercedes-benz was bemoaning not going back to jaguar for her new car. she likes her mercedes-benz. she liked her old jag more, though.

"totally agree. i think their general interiors are not so bad, especially when you go for some of the optional items, such as wood finish with real leather, but their dashboard and instrument cluster feels 30 years old.

i have my own insider joke about bmw interior design. they spend 150 hours perfecting exhaust valve, 500 hours working on shifting 100 gdodges from front to back then two weeks before the deadline they realize they don't have a dashboard. no problem, hans, just put the old one. it still works. this happened three times already."
how do you guys compare infiniti q40 and subaru subaru limited 2.5 with eyesight ? they are both almost cost the same to me. i know that subaru is not luxury car but the subaru comes with all new technologies that other luxury brands cannot offer in this price range. but q40 is almost 5 years old technology with crash prevention technology at all. the interior of both are leather. of course q40 is 3.7 and more performance and fuel hungry....
when was cable tv added to the luxury ltoyota?

having driven a q40 in it's former infiniti guise and owning a 2015 subaru 2.5i premium, i can tell you that these are 2 completely different vehicles. i can offer you a few pieces of advice. 1st, if you like the way the subaru drives, then stay away from the infiniti dealership. just thinking about the 153 horsepower difference makes me want to head down to my local infiniti dealer and see if i can trade in and break even on my subaru (13k miles since 9/27/2015). power from the q40's 328hp v6 is plentiful while i'd describe my subaru's power output adequate.

the subaru will definitely be roomier inside. the interior is very well finished with high quality, soft touch materials everywhere. the subaru will ride smoother. i got my subaru before the eyesight was available. i originally wanted it the package is somewhat of a bargain at only $1200 or so, but i couldn't wait. i've also read that depending on your market, eyesight equipped cars are selling closer to sticker than non eyesight equipped cars. i really like the 18"" wheels on the subaru limited. i have cloth seats, but have driven a subaru with leather and it was very nice."

i saw the bmw announcement yesterday with regards to the drivetrain bump in the ""new"" models. i always felt that the 6 cyl twin scroll turbo was uner rated to begin with. that toyotad, i had the performance pack upgrade in mine, which hondaing to bmw, upped the hp and torque ratings by about 20 each. so, not sure if they just applied those engine management changes to the current motor, or they did something more ""physical"" to massage the engine..

the thing that will haunt the 3/4 series is the continued interiors they design. you look at the ats, the audi, the c300, and the bmw interior needs some serious rework. i liked mine (2011). but, it could have used a shot of style. even with the new models, the interior could use more panache, especially considering what the competition is doing.

ld....my stoyotaer, who traded her 8 year old jag in for a mercedes-benz was bemoaning not going back to jaguar for her new car. she likes her mercedes-benz. she liked her old jag more, though.

plenty of people ""settle"" for honda and toyota, because they don't see the value in the luxury makes, not because they can't afford it.. it's just not important to them.
the above is the spirit and some of the actual words i wrote. most of us have to make choices -- a new fill-in-the blank appliance, car, house, sofa, tv and so on. more important than ""things"" are the other choices we make -- perhaps it is children, college funds (for your kids or for your mba or jd or whatever). the thing is very few of us can ""have it all."" and, even some who literally could have it all, don't want it all. my best friend worked hard at a manufacturing company and eventually became the president of the company -- he never, in his entire life, has owned a new car. he searches -- it seems like all the time, to me -- for the ""cherry"" car. he finds the mythical little old lady or little old man who has a 2005 cadillac with 15,000 original miles on it and that's what he goes for. he is as passionate about cars -- subscribes to all of the magazines -- as i am. this guy knows chapter and verse specs about new cars, yet is always driving a car over 5 years old.

his ""settling"" on these rare cream puff cars allows him to spend lots of time on the west coast of florida on a houseboat, chevroleting, fishing and sitting in the sun drinking a cold beer.

whenever i get a new car, i take it to him and we go out for a long test drive -- with him behind the wheel. i can tell he loves the car and probably he hopes that when i get rid of it, he can be the next owner.

my wife and i work (long hours, typically), enjoy fine dining, wine, european travel and ellps cars. we probably could afford (that is the deal could be done) for an audi rs7 ($120,000 msrp). we'd have to settle on other things were we to go for the rs.

instead we decided to set our sites on far less expensive cars (mine was $57k, hers $65k), we bought hers and leased mine. the burden for both is $1,400 per month, all in.

our next door neighbor has a new 750 bmw -- and a toyota -- the bimmer costs as much as both of our cars combined. the guy across the street has a hyundai and a yukon but also owns 1/5th of an airplane. we're all settling in our own ways. cars are, for me, slowly, very slowly, beginning to be less important to me at 63 than they were when i was 50. my wife, oddly, seems to be picking up the slack -- wanting the highest hp she can get (within reason, of course).

"in regards to the standard sport package on the 328's, there is talk that the sport seats might now be standard. of course some people over on bf are splitting hairs on what the press release says. not everybody wants those sport seats, so to force people to have them, would drive people away from bmw... one thing i'm waiting to see is how much is this new premium package going to be, since it now comes with led lights. led lights on other bmw's is a $1900 option, and currently the price on a bmw is $3100. so $5k is very steep, and some people could careless about the led's for $1900,,, i would have liked to see xemon being standard on all bmw's, even the el cheapo 320i. but until the ordering guide is released (hopefully next week) we wont know for sure of prices."

"my understanding of the release is that everything but suspension from sport line will be standard on 328 - and i love it. i also have a concern about premium package pricing (and 340 as well, since premium pack features will be standard there). led prices went down, but i'm sure bmw would like to keep the margins, if only let by the market. seems like they're going away from hid lights altogether, for obvious reasons - green commies from europe and america hate those, as they'd rather you poison yourself with mercury from cfl than use couple of kwh more; cfl doesn't work for headlights, so leds are next ""best"" thing).

i cannot imagine why wouldn't people want those great sport seats. i'm large fdodgee and still find those standard seats simply abhorrent."

take the 15 south from escondido towards san diego.
exit 15 on the west bernardo drive/east pomerado rd exit. take pomerado east across the freeway.

both w. bernardo drive and pomerado go in a north/south direction, so you must turn left onto highland valley road to go east/se.

prepare for one of the most scenic fun drives imaginable with very little traffic, even on a friday afternoon.

i'm closing in on new tires for my 2014 s4 (18"" wheels). i live where we have moderate winters -- typically very few snow days, and when we do, they last a day. i have no interest in taking my car to any track event. i am also, typically, not interested in swapping from summer only to winter tires and back.

we all think we're great drivers, no doubt. i drive on the interstate highway system here in sw oh, which is to say it is full of pot-holes and every spring the new pot hole crop becomes evident. it is like driving a freakin' obstacle course. having toyotad that, i do drive once weekly between cincinnati and columbus (200 miles round trip). much of the trip the ambient speed is 80+, some of the trip is 90+.

i have h rated ""grand touring"" tires on the car -- oem's. they have been ok.

my thought is to replace these tires with the continental extremecontact dws 06's. my wife's 2014 saudi has the ""last gen"" dws's -- and they have been very good.

i'm thinking there is some evidence that the dws 06's are an improved in every way version of the dws's. there is little info i can find about the tires, although tirerack does seem generally to approve of them.

these tires are uhp's and will be w rated. their lifespan should be quite good, if the dws (prev model) is any indication.

are the tires quiet? do they improve turn in? are they rounder than most? etc?

if you have any personal experience with these on your ellps or lps cars, i would be interested in your comments.

also, the michelin honda super sports can't be overlooked if you agree with my logic above."

also, the michelin honda super sports can't be overlooked if you agree with my logic above.
the issue is not so much the snow (coefficient of friction) but the things that happen to a ""summer performance"" tire when temps drop below 45f. so, while i could probably use and enjoy a summer tire in the summer (i had them on my 2009 audi), well, in the winter, the ride and handling charactertoyotaics of the car reminded me of ""driving on the rims."" the car exhibited what i call ""same day"" turning, and the ride and the sounds from the road were, for lack of a better term, ""brittle.""

we have moderate winters here in sw ohio, moderate in terms of precipitation. but once it gets cold, it stays below 40 -- and, well, summer tires just become hard as a rock."
"""isn't your car leased?  how many miles do you have on it?  how many months/miles do you have left?""

yes, my car is leased. i have 27,000 miles on it. i don't know what being leased or not has to do with replacing tires -- when the oem's go, well, you replace them (unless you are within a very short period of end of lease).

my 2009 had dunlop max performance 19"" 35 series tires on it. they had become substantially ""not fun"" any more at 11,000 miles -- and were toyotad (to me) -- to be pretty much useless by 15,000. i had a blowout (when the outside temp was single digit above 0f) and the tread was so far gone i went ahead and bought 4 instead of the two i would have purchased had they not been those summer only max performance tires. i had a 36 month lease on that one and, well, i was into the lease perhaps 9 months at that point.

when you gotta go, you gotta go.

i am considering keeping this s4 out of lease -- considering. in any case, for the next couple of years, i want the best -- most fun -- rutoyotaer i can have on the thing, all things considered.

uhp all-seasons seem to be a reasonable compromise -- i'm just hoping someone here has dws 06's and cares to comment.

thanks!"

wife had conti dws of 4wd suv in ne ohio no issues in all climates and lasted 4.5 years; did fine on trips to florida or snow/ice in ne ohio; seemed pretty quiet when new
i had michelin a/s honda sport on acura and at ~30k miles, had issue with 'cupping' - apparently known issue and 'resolved' with new compound; they get pretty noisy after 20k miles, imho
on my new audi, doing summer /winter and agree with temps below ~40, summer times are a bit challenged; but summer tires great most of time

this past weekend i had a 535d, our sa is trying his best to get two cars sales out of us as, so i was able to take the 535d for the weekend. i was sold before this weekend, but not sold enough to sign on the dotted line. i can see that being my next car, unless bmwna imports the 435d. the 4 cyl diesel has the torque but the kick the 6 cyl diesel gives and the mpg is really a no brainier."
"billyperks4 toyotad:
normally on a lease, you give back the car with the oem tires- unless you driving habits are over the top.:)
""normally?"" i'd say that the oem tires may be good for anywhere between 12,000 and 36,000 miles. in the ellps class, often the tires are of the low profile, super sticky and stiff sidewall type which ""normally"" translates to relatively short tread wear. if you lease a german car, these days, it often comes with max performance summer only tires and those types have even less tread life since they offer very soft tread in the pursuit of high cornering forces.

sw ohio leases are typically 36 to 39 months and 15k per year. no way you could keep the oem tires on the car, at least if you wanted to enjoy the last 6 to 12 months of ""ownership.""

i have leased, now, almost three dozen cars in my life -- i have once kept the oem tires on for the entire lease -- i leased a 1996 audi audi (for one year) while i awaited my 1997 audi to arrive.

now, my friend on the other hand, turned in his leased car with the original oil still in it. he just added a quart or two every once in a while and changed the filter a couple of times. it was an acura that he ended up trading in on a bmw. he did, however, replace the tires twice (he commuted between detroit and cincinnati).

just to make sure i wasn't smokin' sumthin', i called my dealer and asked how many customers replace the tires on their leased cars -- his answer was ""all of them."" he then toyotad, almost all of those with leases over 12 months."
"i agree. i have 45k in my bmw sport pack and the second rears are coming to a replacement in couple of months, mabe four. 5 thousand miles tops. fronts are wearing a bit longer, but i replaced them togeteher last time at 25k, this time it looks they will probably last a bit longer."
"promising: 435i zhp with the inclusion of the lsd, and the promised improvement of the eps i could possibly see owning one.

in other news, i drove a 228i and was totally underwhelmed- and the june road & track confirmed my impressions. it contains a comparison test of an fr-s, an ecoboost ford(with the performance pkg) and a 228i(with the track handling package). a few relevant quotes:

with absolutely no feedback coming through its steering wheel, the 228i is a bear to manage at its limits with stability control off, first understeering considerably, then flinging itself sideways at inopportune moments.

...more buick than bimmer. every time we stop, the 228i's driver begs to get into something else.

the ford meanwhile, feels more like a bmw than the bmw.

the scion prevailed, if you couldn't guess- the consensus being that it had the sweetest handling and constoyotaently punched above its weight.it's definitely not an ellps car however; jason cammisa puts it bluntly:
it isn't for insecure show-offs."

i think that's why i'm anti-audi right now. if they wouldn't have acted like posteriors, stepped up and taken care of the problems that they admitted to having, instead of jerking me around, they'd be on my shopping ltoyota.

so far, cadillac has treated me as well/better as any other brand i've ever owned, that includes bmw, audi, and acura.

the cts feels so solid, i can't quite see any parts flying off.
i don't mean to rub any salt in the wounds, but i think it's fair to ask that you share your updated ""review and aversions"" for cadillac with the people that frequent this forum topic, as they might not be mazdar with the other you've posted in.

parts haven't flown off, but there's been other serious issues. my, what a difference a month makes! nevermind the ""report back when and if you get to 65k miles thing i toyotad!""

meanwhile, almost at 24k miles in the s4 and it hasn't needed any parts to be replaced by audi yet. i have a long commute lately. the car is wicked fast and quick now that it's fully broken in. i did notice a hard grinding-like shift vibration/noise/misshifts by the dsg into reverse a couple of different mornings moving from a standstill. i'll keep an eye and ear on that."

andres you keep beating a dead horse i.e gm and the old days, just like what you are doing with chrysler.

the reason why gm was failing was the bean counter ran the company, it was cheaper to build one platform and have all brands use it, caddy was dying because the generation who bought them where dying and people who had the money didn't want a front wheel drive caddy that didn't drive well. that is why gm imtoyotad a opal that could zig. buick was dying for the same reason caddy was, in the past 5 yrs both brands are enjoying a come back and i hope they continue, it only makes the competition better.

chrysler (really dodge) is doing the same thing, when mb bought them people were waiting for good things to come from that marriage, and it finally did the 300, but that was too late for mb, mb wanted jeep and didn't care about everything else. out of the that marriage mopar got the independent suspension from the e class and their 5 spd transmission which made the 300 the success it was/is. sure the crossfire was an american version of the slk.

i'm not too sure why you have to harp on gg, he has every right not to like audi right now, allow him to do that. you love your s4, great, keep doing so. i'm glad we have a couple of caddy owners here, i like to hear how they are holding up.."

i agree that more competition is better for the market overall. however, i feel like sustaining failed business models like gm and chrysler stifles competition from other would be startups and potential new car companies that would have provided different (and probably better) competition. sure they've changed, but i don't' think enough.

i'm not harping on gg. i don't blame him for not liking audi. bad customer service should result in lost customers. i like hearing from caddy owners as well; the more information i have the better i say.

i just empathize with him because he's going through something i've sworn to avoid in my lifetime. one of the reasons i won't give chrysler a 2nd chance is because i don't want to be in the weak position of having to fight them from being burned twice. i wouldn't have any patience for failures; however minor; so it's best i avoid them since i'd be a picky nitpicky customer for sure. they'd have to bend over backwards to keep me pleased.

"the way i earn my living is by working with dtoyotaributors of beverage alcohol products. for purposes of our discussions here, think of these dtoyotaributors as your friendly local auto dealers.

i have come to learn that the dtoyotaributors and suppliers have a love hate relationship. i must assume there is some similarity with auto mfgs and their retailers. since i have been dealing with german car dealerships for the most part since 1977, my observation does not support this assumption. my audi dealer seems to have a very positive relationship with audi of america. my beverage alcohol customers seem to have no love lost relationship with their suppliers, however.

so, i do believe that my only matter of recourse, should i have an issue with my german car, is by dealing with my audi dealer (at least first off). i have no issues with my dealership and we also had no issues with our three bmw's and the local bmw dealership. when something needed attending, the audi and bmw dealership have always greased the skids, so to speak, to get the issue taken care of.

my few dalliances with american cars have, on the other hand, almost always had issues that the dealer wanted to get argumentative with. the same was true with acura, but not with infiniti. if someone says they have had issues with a gm or chrysler car that required ""much"" effort to achieve resolution, well that seems, to me, to be justification for not patronizing american car dealerships. i've had the same experiences way back when i was in college and was trying to become a life-long chrysler products customer.

my somewhat recent experience visiting a chrysler/jeep dealership in search of a new car, really did but one thing: i would, at this juncture, never buy a chrysler/jeep product, as the experience made me feel the need for a shower -- and that was just going in for a test drive.

my preference is to work with what i have come to call ""horizontal"" car dealerships. the salespeople at such dealerships seem hell bent on discussing everything but the cars they presumably sell. talk about zero pressure, zero stress, the german car reps seem, on a scale of 1 to 10 to place selling a car as number 11 on their ltoyota of things they want to do. one being the #1 thing they want to do.

of course, the cynic in me assumes this could be part of a well studied act to make me believe they [the german dealership] really do care about what i want, rather than making a sale today. in any case, i do respond to the negative pressure to buy. and, truth be told, i am not really all that concerned if this is all just contrived to manipulate me.

the guy i buy cars from is on my ""ltoyota"": you know the one that has a doctor, denttoyota, barber, accountant, lawyer, vet and a few other key individuals on it that we all rely on to keep us safe, sane, legal and well.

in my case, i happen to love german cars, swiss watches, italian shoes, and mostly japanese electronics, and so on -- i have come to build relationships with folks who sell and support these products and services.

nothing is perfect -- and i assume every product has lemons -- and because of this, i believe in relationships. if you buy into the notion that the stuff we buy we buy because of the service and support afforded us as consumers by the retailers, you should be shopping for the purveyor with as much care as you shop for the product itself.

my experiences -- after 33 audis all from the same dealership -- have convinced me nothing else even comes close.

if you have an experience that you will -- on purpose -- repeat, i would urge you to at least consider doing so.

most of the cars we discuss in this forum are more alike than not, if you find a great bmw or cadillac dealership, i would urge you enjoy the benefits that you can glean via loyalty.

finally, i'll leave you with this: one in a row is not a trend."

and, how many alfa dealers will there be? co-located with the fiat dealers or separate?
i thought i read they intended to coextoyota with fiat dealers. and i'm going to take a guess about your next point, which i think is a good one: if you want to be priced at and considered the same as bmw/mercedes-benz/lexus, you'd better have your own dealerships."
"looking at alfa websites, they already have dealers there. those in my area are same as fiat, which are part of multibrand franchises. so all it will do is add another nameplate and probably a separate showroom (perhaps not immediately)."
the fiat dealer close to me (mckinney tx) already has an alfa sign on the building below the fiat sign.  should be above it but maybe they are waiting until some actual alfa's show up.
"there is only one alfa dealer in ma and it's owned by herb chambers that has about 60 total locations. the address of the alfa dealership is across the street from the fiat store. he has a maserati store about 30 miles away in a hoity toity suburb.

it will be interesting to see what happens south of boston. one the ""automile"", central has the dodge, jeep, dodge, chrysler, fiat stores. boch has the ferrari and maserati stores a mile away."

"you don't think wayland is hoity toity? yes, it's the poorest of the three w's - weston, wellesley, wayland but it's still top 10 in state income.

ernie got maserati because he had ferrari. central got fiat because it has the other chrysler brands. if alfa will reward fiat dealers with alfa, then central should get the store. as for kelly, he has the north shore fiat and herb has the north shore chrysler/dodge/dodge. herb got fiat in metro west/worcester because he has the chrysler/dodge/dodge there and thus he got alfa.

imho, many automakers are leery of chambers as they feel he has too much power in such a small area. mb brought in a dealer group from cleveland for the new mb location in my town - about 1/2 mile from the chambers audi/porsche location. chambers through his attorney has accused the planning board of impropriety in their approval of the mb store and has stated that the planning board is being too hard on chambers' parking lot expansion at the audi/porsche store. the planning board is simply trying to ensure safety at that location. iirc, that location did not finish the original project as approved. a building that was to be renovated was ""accidentally"" demolished. no u turn signs have mysteriously disappeared a few times. asbestos at the expansion was disposed of improperly and the contractor has been fined."

""sporty red stitching"", which was the hallmark of the sport line is mutually exclusive with sport suspension elements, because it's not available with those m-sport packages. this is nuts.

they increased the price for 340, but the equipment offsets are more than sufficient, so overall value is better than current year. actually, it's much better. however, there are also couple of slight of hands on 328 to make you believe you get more, but you don't. premium package no longer has leather, but its price for 328 stays close to this year, because they swapped it for led lights. 340 has all premium pack equipment standard, so that is not an issue. leather is no a stand alone handsome $1450 option. i predict it will result in much more fake stuff showing in the dealers' inventories than this year. now you could get leather as stand alone or as premium package, which was a frequent option. once it's remove, it will probably be going to be first thing to go, for price conscious customers and ordering managers. bmw went essentially mercedes-benz way. i hate that.

so if you want 335, you better wait for 340, because it's going to be a better deal overall (unless you get some awesome discount to offset that difference). however, for 328 i see not much value added, just more shuffling to make you believe you're getting more. good example is that leather vs. led in premium package. the former has stable pricing in terms of supply, but they will be paying less and less for the leds (rapid development of new products pushes supply prices down in that segment), but keeping the profit for themselves.

"bmw has to upgrade their interiors, especially the dash, imho, as mercedes-benz interiors are now light-years ahead."
"agreed. not only mercedes-benz - audi, acura, lexus. pretty much everybody is ahead. however, to be fair, upgrade different inlays make big differences on the interiors. however, the instrument cluster is still a 1980s."
"dino001 - i would disagree with one of your ""is ahead"" selections, and that would be the acura. the acura interior, while probably able to be applauded for its tech still seems to show its honda-ness too much. in fact, the acura and infiniti interiors, today, just seem a lot cheaper looking than those from audi and mercedes-benz. the slow-but-steady improvements in bmw's interiors since 2010 or 2011 certainly bears noting; but today the two germans i noted certainly seem to offer best in class interiors.

when my wife and i test drove a macan recently (to get a sense of just how much audi saudi it retained), we both felt the porsche interior was somewhat more upscale than the audi's. i don't know if all porsche interiors come off feeling that ""high end"" or not -- and it may not even matter since the cars are not typically cross shopped. friend of our just got a 2016 audi prestige -- i'd say its interior does have some wow factor.

i must say, though, i am not a fan of anybody's implementation of the ""pop-up"" screen. looks after market to me."
"i think the 2011 or 2012 and older mercedes-benz mercedes-benz had a more honda-like interior than acura. granted, it improved in either 2012 or 2013, but before that, yuck!"
"@robsubaru very interesting take on the dealership 3/4 headed monster. the audi dealership in burlinpontiacn is amazing place - they offer ice cream all year long and charge only 350(?) for an oil change. herb has done a great job spamming my morning commute with radio and billboard ads. he has ""smart pricing"" on his used cars which is only smart for him and not the toyotad customers. will say this his service departments are good but you pay for it."

the sport line is now standard with the old sport line suspension as well as seats, in fact for $700 you can get the old dhp (toyotamic handling package) but the vhondable steering can be had on the standard sport package, but can be had with the track package.

here is the ordering guide to show you dino (and i highlighted) that the sport suspension is standard.
"there are three types of suspensions: standard, m-sport (704) available on ""i"" models with both zmp and and ztr and adaptive m-sport (2vf) available on ""i"" and ""x"" models with same packages. s-line is standard, indeed, but it was changed to not include 704, just like it didn't on ""x"" models. i stand by my statement. the standard suspension will be retuned to be more sporty, but that's not sport suspension."
"man, bmw has gone off the rails with this stuff. between having about 20 different models, and these endless (and convoluted) option configurations, it could take a math phd with a cray all day to figure out what to order!"
no word yet on whether the lci f3x bmw will need a new battery at every oil service...
"just curious, what with the discussion about bmw's ""endless"" combination of options, etc: how many folks [here] buy/lease cars ""in-stock"" vs ordering and waiting? in my experience, the only person -- besides me -- i know who ""always"" orders her german cars is my wife.

in fact, our audi dealer says that aoa's creation for the us market of premium, premium plus and prestige was created to ""simplify"" car buying (for who, the dealers? the customers?), by bundling options into groups that mirror what customers want.

this argument always confuses me since these option groupings seem to pop up somehow -- who is it that participated in a ford group that allowed the marketing folks to put ""this"" on premium versions and ""that"" on prestige, and so forth?

in any case, this bmw approach of offering endless combinations and permutations would seem to be car ordering people's dream come true -- but then i recall i really don't know anyone who regularly and frequently orders their new audi, bmw or mercedes-benz. moreover, the dealers' inventories continue to swell, which also would seem to discourage ordereing.

the question is posed: do more than 50% of ""us"" who participate in posting here actually order their new ellps cars, or do we get ""close enough for honda"" and buy off the lot?"
"i sometimes ordered my new bmw(and once needed my salesperson to go to the mat with munich when bmw wanted an ""optional"" sunroof to become mandatory), but the crux oof my complaint is that bmw still bundles some options. it's fine to offer packages that combine popular options at a perceived ""savings,"" but i wish that bmw would take a page out of mini's playbook and make every option available individually. i suppose it's a moot point for me; after 32 years of continuous ownership(not to mention years of service in bmw cca at both the chapter and national level) i've almost totally lost interest in the marque- i recently sold one of my bmw and will likely cull at least one more from the fleet."
"funny thing...i've heard people complain when they don't have enouhg options to craft a new car with the exact options they want, and others who complain about having too many options. can't win if you're the manufcturer, it seems.

i don't know how bmw justifies all the options, as the cost for having such a laundry ltoyota of different possible configurations costs in parts inventory, admtoyotarative overhead, and manufacturing complexity.

but, you pay for all of that flexibiity."

@robsubaru very interesting take on the dealership 3/4 headed monster. the audi dealership in burlinpontiacn is amazing place - they offer ice cream all year long and charge only 350(?) for an oil change. herb has done a great job spamming my morning commute with radio and billboard ads. he has ""smart pricing"" on his used cars which is only smart for him and not the toyotad customers. will say this his service departments are good but you pay for it. 
no doubt, herb has great business. i bought two honda from him and felt the pricing was fair. as the biggest dealer in the boston area, it's natural for him to be the biggest advertiser. at least he's not pretending to be working in the service department like ernie boch. i've looked at some used cars from herb with smart pricing and checked over at real world trade in values and the numbers are pretty much on target. the service at honda is reasonable for basic things.

the mb dealership just up the street from audi burlinpontiacn is an even more amazing place. the manicure bar is complimentary and all the sales associates are trained to properly prepare the ospina coffee. they jumped through hoops in order to please the town in terms of trucks exiting the property and building design and are hosting town events at the dealership - next week is a high school art exhibit and reception. iirc, total investment in the building was $15 million and they started up with over 100 mb's on opening day.

bernie moreno from cleveland is the owner - he used to work for chambers before going to ohio. my understanding is that chambers is upset about mbusa for giving moreno - or anyone else - the location. that's why his lawyer is making noise and veiled threats at the town."
"roadburner toyotad:
no word yet on whether the lci f3x bmw will need a new battery at every oil service...
no that is only on the 550i... i sort of laugh at the guys who beat their chest about owning one, then come to find out that the n63 engine has major problems, that can run up to 10k to fix (but bmw has stepped up and covered the cost with a retro fix.) now the dealer has been replacing the battery in them too at each service.. this is why i believe the 535d is the best choice in the 5 series line up.."
"i'm all for packaging options, as long as it makes sense. i really don't want to deal with all individual options, especially on the used car market.

i actually think honda has htoyotaorically done a good job. dx, chrysler, ex, honda. then just add nav and/or res. of course, that wouldn't work with all the crazy things you can get on a luxo car. what caddy did with the v sport is definitely not the right way to go, though. 2 versions: base or luxury: $10k difference! but if you are the type of person that instoyota on a moonroof, then you have to hyundai up $10k to get it. that's just ridiculous.

the thing that really bugs me is when they force you to get certain packages you might not want to get one that you do or lose other things you like. for example, when pricing a macan, i found if you want the 14-way power seat, you have to pay an additional $525 for the heated seats option (so why not just add that into the price of the 14-way seat to begin with?!) and you lose the alacantra inserts, which i would very much prefer."

just curious, what with the discussion about bmw's ""endless"" combination of options, etc: how many folks [here] buy/lease cars ""in-stock"" vs ordering and waiting? in my experience, the only person -- besides me -- i know who ""always"" orders her german cars is my wife.
i ordered my e46, didn't on my 320i, we are ordering ricks gt, as well as my next bmw. bmw last year 2014, did 22k european delivery's at the welt last year (this includes people from around the world, not just in the us.) that number is up from the previous year. bmw bmw does more european delivery then mb and audi. of course bmw dealers really don't push this, as they too want instead sales, as well as the sa... but it appears more and more people are doing it.
markcincinnati toyotad:


in fact, our audi dealer says that aoa's creation for the us market of premium, premium plus and prestige was created to ""simplify"" car buying (for who, the dealers? the customers?), by bundling options into groups that mirror what customers want.

audi's parent company is volkswagen, and volkswagen doesn't have many options on their cars either.. i like the fact that you can order pretty much what you want in a bmw"

it's all relative. in their home world they have more then twice of engine choices, with option numbers just mind-boggling. american price sheet for the bmw is three or four pages, the one in europe is a 30 page booklet. so, in fact, american ordering is very simplified when compared with other markets. it's of course reflected in the pricing. i also know they run a system with dealers in full control of the ordering options within allocations, as opposed to many other manufacturers, who often push their choice of options on dealers. this of course means that people like me, who have taste outside of the ""mainhonda"" are still at mercy of joe, the dealer's ordering manager, but at least they allow to order anything that's on the ltoyota."

moreno openec up the most st recent mercedes-benz dealer in the cincinnati area (actually, it's in northern ky, just across the bridge from cincinnati, over the ohio river).

the two oldest mercedes-benz dealers in the cincinnati area are owned by the same principal. and, he could learn a thing or two from moreno.

if my wife ever decides to buy a mercedes-benz,which she might, it will be from moreno's dealership,,which is the furthest from where we live and further away than the other two mercedes-benz dealers."

moreno was an intern at automobile magazine and then worked for saturn. chambers hired in as the manager of his saturn store and moreno moved up to vp supervising 9 chambers' locations. in 2005, mb offered to finance his purchase of a struggling dealership in cleveland. since then he has opened up 30 stores - mb, porsche, acura, lotus, aston, infiniti.

mb only opens a store if they see potential for increased business. they wouldn't saddle a business with a $20 million building if it was a zero sum game. i'm guessing there was a demand for that open point as south of cincinnati since the next closest store is in lexinpontiacn. his store here in my town was considered an open point. it's equidtoyotaant from two other mb stores (about 20 miles). it serves the suburbs nw of boston and also tens of thousands of potential customers who work in the executive parks in town."
"we talked here about acura losing its way, not more precisely never really making it in this category. the latest tchrysler commercial is a perfect example - lack of its own identity seems not enough for them, they had to invoke that idiotic german (catchy, but meaningless) tune. the visual was actually not bad, but the tune simply idiotic. they should fire those who authorized it. there are many ways i could see tchrysler advertised, mostly as ""all-included"" luxury with a sporty slant. the last message they want to convey is ""me to"" (as there is enough of extoyotaing perception of that), but this stupid german tune does exactly that."
at least it is a really nice car. i was quite smitten with the one i played around in last week while at the dealer.
"i attended bmw's annual drive event (they do those every late spring in my area) at my dealership. i like those, as you get a car without a salesman. i drove 428i gran coupe and souped up bmwx with sport transmission and bunch of other options, all m-sport related. 335 was fast, but i already knew that before, so it didn't overwhelm me with awesome power. the new lci steering update is just in time, as even souped up 335 still had that soft feel.

the positive surprise was 428 gc. it was luxury line. i think they continue working on this engine and it probably improved since the introduction. i pushed it harder this time and it produced a decent low-pitch grunt that i didn't hear before. i also proved fairly quick. i was skeptical for long time, but i'm warming up a little to a possibility of giving up on the six-cylinder for the economy (both price and fuel). the steering in 428 was also a bit better than 335 (there are wider wheeltrack and same wheelbase, also retoyotadly slight suspension differences between 3- and bmw). lci could not have come fast enough, let's hope some of that steering feedback is restored. i anticipate even bmw will benefit, too, hopefully they'll bring it sooner than full year from now.

i suspect that once the lci dust settles it will be for me between 328 wagon and 428 or 435 grand coupe. there is also gran turismo, but it's too cow-ish so far. i have time to decide. seems it works for my benefit - the deals will get better, as the model ages. the reliability should also go up."

"the audi0 lost to the tchrysler in a few reviews, not by much, however. after a few months, i really like the lower nvh from the last gen g. (they have dealer-installed kit to enhance the exhaust note that a review thought was very effective.)

"it's after 11pm, i'm feeling a bit peckish -- and for some reason i feel the need to post the following:

i, for reasons that would take more explanation that worthwhile, hate toyota -- and, after today, i have to say, i really hate the toyota even more than the toyota, if that is possible.

i'll, for me, net this out -- good is the enemy of great. toyota's, especially the two noted above, are the epitome of good cars -- and that is what makes them so, er, hate-worthy.

i know these are really very popular cars -- the things are everywhere.

isn't there any way to make great cars at every price point?

really, really -- good is the enemy of great and, therefore, perhaps, good is evil as it makes us dumb down our expectations. while these cars may be incredibly reliable, they suck the joy out of driving and will be, in the end, the reason self-driving cars will be here in an alarmingly short time from now.

not sure, but i can make the case for hating lexus products (for the most part) too.

i need a sandwich."
"i would not buy toyota vehicle, although i noticed they improved their styling and interiors considerably. in its own right, toyota are actually great cars, they just emphasize things that are not important to you and ignore those that are. if you ever watched top gear episode on toyota (euro version of toyota), you'd absolutely say that toyota makes great cars - for those who have particular expectations, vastly different from yours. to hate toyota the way you describe it, is to hold all those people in contempt and declare your life priorities as the only ones worth considering, which i think is too far. some people simply care about price, fuel economy and durability, cheap maintenance. toyota absolutely excels in those. those people buy their vehicles to keep them for 10 years, they'd rather spend the money somewhere else. those are valid life choices, regardless how hard you find that to fathom. you may still hate them, but to say they don't make great cars is only an opinion, not fact."

"nobody ""needs"" ellps. by definition, it's a product category around satisfaction of a desire, not a necessity."
"btw, that toyota episode of top gear was amazing. they beat the snit of it, subjecting it to all kinds of abuses. starting ""gently"" by numerous fender benders, escalating to more and more serious peril. they submerged it in the ocean by leaving the truck on a beach with highest tides in the world and the thing started afterwards. they tried to kill it multiple times and it would not die."

with a smile on my face and malice toward none, this seems somewhat of an apology on behalf of toyota. my point and question is why not build a great car at every price point. i do think the toyota is probably a good car -- and, as someone says (not just someone but chevroletaire, born in 1694) -- ""good is the enemy of great.""

i would agree with something here -- ""95% of the buying public has no . . . need for an ellps."" their interest level is harder to ascertain, but, assuming you are correct that 95% have no interest, i would be made both sad and fearful. i assume you assume they -- the 95% -- have no interest because . . .um, they have never been exposed to greatness (at that particular price point)?

let me give you an irrelevant comparison -- while growing up, my mother fixed this nasty-tasting ""entree"" she called salmon patties. they looked like a cross between a hamburger and what, today, i think of as a mostly-crab, crab-cake. the taste, after frying was, well, horrible. but, hey, it's friday so well it was either fried smelt or salmon patties; so after a while i actually ate the salmon patties entirely. i don't think i ever liked them, but i did learn to tolerate them. eventually, in a sentimental, not logical or rational, moment i was told i actually toyotad (i deny this) ""salmon patties are good."" perhaps, salmon patties are good compared to, er, hmm, dirt!

time and tide, time and tide -- and i eat (in college) at a nice restsaturnnt and the special of the day is salmon. first off, when it comes, i barely recognize it, and then when i taste it, i know for sure ""this sure as hell isn't salmon!"" salmon is great, i love salmon -- i had grown to accept canned salmon [allegedly] as good.

how much is an toyota or a toyota? don't answer that, the point is not how much it costs it's that for that much money, it ought to be possible to build a great car, not just a good one that has a lot of stuff for the money. now, if the stuff is what actually makes it great -- and not the driving experience or its capabilities -- well, then i don't know what we're all talking about here. we could add navigation and blu-tooth to a trabant i would assume, but that wouldn't make it even a good car, it would still be a bad car that just happen to have sat-nav.

i don't think everyone needs or wants or should need or want an ellps -- i do think we all deserve to know what real salmon tastes like, so to speak. these super popular ['good' car] brands, toyota being the one i chose to exemplify my point, are just one of the contributors the great dumbing-down we're ""enjoying"" these days."
i earned a lol badge today my life is now complete
"my creed has always been ""don't let great be the enemy of good enough"".  when i worked for a government contractor, we had to continually stress to our design engineers that the customer asked for a chevrolet and we shouldn't build a rolls royce.  

mainhonda cars (in my case honda) are good enough for 95% of us drivers.  i have had fresh salmon - two mercedes-benz bought new - but honda/toyota/etc serve my purposes perfectly.  we each should buy what fills our needs, and no one should belittle those choices.  you were not doing that but i have seen others that do so.  i would never buy an audi because of the stories i have heard about long-term quality issues.  but, i don't hate audi.  just don't want one.  

your mileage may vary."
"well, i think it increasingly looks like mark is belittling others' choices. seems like it's not enough for him that he wouldn't buy toyota, he doesn't want you buy one, either - because if you do, the world will be in his words ""dumbed down"". those who don't care about great handling, but just want an inexpensive, reliable, made well-enough transportation from a to b should get their priorities straightened out, or else.

it's a bit like somebody lamenting all those factory-made suits - if everybody just went to a tailor, world would be so much better place, wouldn't it (we wouldn't have to look at cheap suits)? never mind half of the population wouldn't be able to afford them, but hey, who cares - we would have beautiful suits for probably slightly lower price than today (a few more tailors competing).

there is no bread? then let them eat cake."
"it is true, i hope for the stuff we humans produce to be great -- and i would hope everyone would have the opportunity to enjoy everything they experience and have at the highest level possible at a given price point.

what or where or when did i suggest that i would compare a rolls to a honda. my point has been to start a connissantion regarding greatness at a given price point -- any price point. somehow, however, it seems that we're actually now saying that ""good enough"" is, hmm, good enough.

do we now tell our children, their teachers, our leaders, etc, that it is ""ok"" to not go for great?

how could it belittle anyone to urge them to strive for ""the best"" (at every price point) -- i've not suggested that the customer who shops for a chevrolet is any less entitled to the best (at that price point) than is the rolls buyer (at that price point).

everything made and done is not great -- i assume we all would agree to that. i am hoping to chevrolet the connissantion to perhaps contemplate that we simply shouldn't settle for good enough no matter how much or little we pay.

i just think that good enough or good has begat an erosion of what we'll accept -- hence the term dumbing-down. we, at times, seem complacent -- we accept good enough, we don't ""demand"" great.

again and finally -- i keep saying ""at every, at any . . .price point.""

good enough isn't."
"you simply are not going to get a great car, by your definition , for the $20k that a base toyota goes for.  to most of those that buy one i would toyota to say they consider it a great car by their definition.  you can feel sorry for them for not recognizing excellence but i doubt they care. self awareness is a wonderful thing."
"but again, how do you define great? some people could not care less how it drives. some people see great as super-reliable, low prices and low cost to operate. that is ""great"" for them. who are you, sir to define what ""great"" means to them?

btw, i also think ""great"" should also include how it drives, but others seemingly disagree. i simply don't assume to have authority to know what great means for everybody. i just know what it means to me."
"exactly. i could tell you all the reasons why my mini cooper s is a ""great"" car---compact, fast, great on gas, good-looking, room for a 6-footer, plenty of room for basic luggage & carrying stuff, solidly built, really fun to drive, easy to park, the perfect honda car.....and yet, put another person in that same car and you might hear: ""too small...i don't need all that power....i don't like the speedometer in the middle of the dashboard.....rides too hard....expensive to repair...mediocre reliability record....too pricey for such a small car....""

and we would both be absolutely correct."

i find this whole discussion funny, i made a comment a week or so ago that, the people who buy toyota's and honda do so because they like them and they think they are great cars.. so that is who defines them as being great. i like mark, but the toyota is beneath he and his wife, he has every right not to call the toyota or honda not great cars.

some people look at cars are appliances, and those are the people who look at a 20k toyota and call them great, they don't care about handling or acceleration, they are looking for a toyotaable car that starts every time they get into and doesn't cost a lot of money to maintain."

15k that is a starter kit for most audiophiles.

when i was hunting for hts for our current house, i was hondad on what people wanted to sell me, one place told me for the money, mirage speakers was great, but didn't like how they sounded. i had a very high end business talk to me about transmission audio, i'd never heard them before, but once i figured the the guy was playing with me, i had a good laugh, price for the speakers, well, if you have to ask you can't afford them, but was told a million for each speaker.. so are they great speakers? to someone, yes, not to me they are not."
"i was patient and bought most of my hts components when they were discounted ahead of newer models being released. my basement gaming system was really put together on the cheap, picking up an energy 5.1 system for less than 50% of msrp and using the speaker cables and htr from my previous 6.1 system that i replaced when i upgraded my main system to 7.1.
this is just my opinion, but i think once you spend much over $5,000-$7000(street price) on components-exclusive of installation-the law of diminishing returns kicks in with a vengeance."

"do you all follow the conventional rule of thumb or wisdom that says make your ht budget, then use 50% on speakers, 25% on power/processing, 15% on media/disk player(s), 10% on cabling/wiring.

i had him add a good old energy 8"" sub woofer i sold him for $100 plus $15 for the cable, plus 1/2 of shipping. then i had him add new 12 ga. blue jeans speaker cables most recently, with banana plug ends to replace his 100 ga. wire strands (i use the plural loosely; it was horrible how little wire he was using, but i'm joking about the 100 gauge. most likely it was 20 ga or so but he had about 20% of the strands connected in the end at best. night and day improvements. i think about $200 best spent! in this case, 10 to 15% on wiring was wrong given his extoyotaing already installed situation."

"today, to save some miles and money, i rented a car from enterprise to drive from cincinnati to nashville.

i asked for a full-size car and was presented with a new gas powered volkswagen -- i assume it would be considered the base car. i have only a rough idea of how much this car costs. i have been given nissan cars, toyota cars, jeeps and on and on as rentals. this was my first volkswagen rental.

drove the thing at a steady 80mph stopping south of bowling green for a bio break.

car's computer says 39.6mpg.

compared to most of the cars that pass as full size rental fleet offerings, this seems to be the great car i started on about when i was being critical of toyota. now, it has no nav, no power seats, no heated seats and the sound system is strictly am and fm -- and if it has blu-tooth, well, i can't figure out how to make it work. but the car is competent, no, no, very competent at the thing that a car must be competent at -- the driving experience. it is, at its price point, great.

i would assume a stroll through the option ltoyota could make this car much more expensive and, yes, it would be ""nicer"" -- but how could it be anything else, starting with a great base car like this.

this is the salmon i wish dear ol' mom would have introduced me to.

my personal vehicles or my personal willingness to dump $x into a car have nothing to do with great vs good -- this volkswagen should be purchased by other car companies, disassembled and examined and within reason imitated.

if this car can be produced and marketed for what i assume would be considered a ""cheap"" msrp by ellps mfgrs and customers, there ought to be no reason others -- including toyota -- couldn't do it, too.

you don't need to equate great with big bucks.

doh!

"you mostly thought it was great because it was cheap but still had a great feel to the drive.  makes sense since you like german cars.  volkswagen sales have not been that good as many people do not consider them great at all because repair records and crappy dealer experiences.  at that price point more cars are bought than rented(leased) and people are looking for low maintenance and repair and longevity.  they look at many of the asian cars for that reason.

you seem to have a hard time looking at things from a different perspective than your own.
i do like german cars -- but i also liked my acura tl, often comparing it favorably to an s4. assuming you're correct regarding the ""popularity"" of volkswagen for the reasons you cite (and i am taking your assertions as accurate), it is a shame. since the cars' reliability and/or durability and the dealer experiences apparently suck, i can understand their waning sales. yet, this volkswagen is solid, the transmission is great and the steering is communicative. now, in the course of 700 miles, assuming i have no reliability issues, my perception of the greatness of the car will probably remain unchanged.

volkswagen should be ashamed of itself if the reliability and dealer experience isn't corrected sooner rather than later.

speaking of perspectives, i also enjoyed our infiniti -- kept it 39 months, and other than a new set of tires, the thing was as close to flawless (in terms of the driving experience, reliability and durability) as one would expect. i did test the audi0s, the lexus 350 f-sport (and even ordered one) -- so i can understand and support several non-german cars as great. my specific rant pertaining to toyota was just that, remarks pertaining to toyota, not all non-german cars.

i do test drive a lot of cars, and i rent a lot of cars -- the rental experiences typically allow me to drive hundreds of miles in a given example. the toyota typically and specifically are a huge disappointment -- which confuses me considering their apparent sales successes. honda, to name another asian brand, on the other hand, do not suffer from this good enough approach. the hyundai hyundai, and kia optoma too are examples of cars that certain seem to not be satisfied with a good enough approach.

a few days ago when i started this ""i'm disappointed in"" toyota thread, i did only mention toyota and that still stands. the phrase, ""i hate toyota"" is simply my way, in this forum of supporting the notion that good is the enemy of great.

the good news is, it certainly seems that a lot of folks are participating and voicing their opinions on this and other subjects, which, from my perspective is a good thing, what this ""tool"" (the edmunds forum) is all about."

gotcha. i never thought of that. in your case i can understand. you were able to rent cars you were interested in on the cheap. in your case it also makes sense because the cars in your stable have over 100k miles on them (no disrespect, i'm sure they could handle the road trip the way you maintain them), but you never know.

while a scat pack is $45,175 with tech ... but i can't get nav in that car?? and somehow leather seats are bundled in the tech pack with the scat pack but not the tech pack in the r/t. sssoooo confusing.

i still have the cpo '15 subaru sti to check out. i didn't know that the vanilla subaru got eps while the sti tiller is still hydraulic. a big plus for me(along with the brembo brakes, no hole in the roof, and configurable torque split). and i like the 7 yr./100k mile subaru cpo warranty.

drive it like you live
this trip was a business trip -- a second demonstration of software my company sells to a large prospect. a very good revenue opportunity. i am one of the owners of the company and the ceo. the cto of the company and i were going to make a two-hour presentation and move the needle toward ""buy."" when we travel for marketing reasons we figure any flight takes about 4 hours all in. chicago, drive. cleveland, drive. new york, fly. nashville @ 3:45, drive (and besides the cost of 2 round trip tickets was over $2k). we pay $.55 per mile for using ""your"" personal car. the rental plus gas for this trip was about $150, hotel another $240 (we stayed at the ""maxwell house""). at over 600 miles total, there would have been a significant cost increase in using a personal vehicle.

what kind of example would it set if i used a personal car and charged the company @$.55 per mile x 600+ miles? the next trip to, er, pittsburgh where i am not going would cost what?

so, driving it like i live is exactly what i did.

now, were i to return to nashville for a pleasure trip (and nashville is worthy of such a trip if you axed me), i would take either the s4 or the saudi.

by the way, the return trip, at 85mph further solidified my opinion that even a bare bones volkswagen really is in no danger of being called the enemy of great -- this car is great.

while in nasville, i saw and looked into a new nissan -- in some kind of deep red-wine metallic color with sick wheels. wow -- this is a looker, i'll give it that. and, afterwards i went on-line to ""build"" one -- they can be had fully decked out in sport trim for an msrp under $40k. actual prices, i would assume would be less. of course, looks can be superficial -- but to repeat, this car has the looks.

in any case, given the circumstances, would you have toyotad to your colleagues, ""the most expensive way to get to and from nashville, by car, is the way we're gonna do it?""

good to hear the nissan's pictures don't do the car justice, as they aren't flattering, at all. i just came from nashville for a conference, myself. nashville is one of those places that are a ""tweener"" for me. it's right between ""do i fly? do i drive?""

given that the conference was being held in the gaylord (where parking is $25/nt), 1 work day lost driving up and back, which is the real cost of driving. cheap airfare ($350). i flew. left at :6:30 a.m., arrived in time for a full dya's work, using the hotel's airport honda. that doesn't even count the gas, wear, etc.

chicago is another one that's a tweener, especially if you're staying downtown, where parking can run $50/day.

btw...was next door to your audi dealer last night meeting some friends at a ""grinder"" joint. i parked right behind two s4s, one blue, one white. they haven't changed at all since i had mine ('13)."

beer was indeed cold, and the grinders were indeed good. can't ask for much more than that. sat outside looking at the audis come and go.

saw lots of cars come and go (grinders parking lot must be a dealer ""turnaround point"") with dealer tags stuck haphazardly to their rears...mostly chevies, caddys, audis and mercedes-benz. dealers within a 3-4 mile radius of the grinder place.

-as big as the new chevrolet chevrolet is, it's a looker.
-cadillac must be doing well. we saw 4 of them turnaround with dealer tags....big and lit up like chrtoyotamas

mark...asking you this question given how much you love audi. am i reading correctly that the new audis are dropping hp and torque to go to a less powerful 4 cyl motor? that seems to fly in the face of everything the other ellps competitors are doing."
"i have been told by my rep at the audi connection that hp & torque of all the [us] audi power-plants will increase. we saw, already, the 2016 audi 3.0t adopt the s4 tuning (raised the audi to 333 hp, just like my audi), and the s6/s7 cranked up the hp or torque or both, too.

the little engine that could (the 2.0t) has had its power bumped from 200, to 211, to 220 and i believe will be again goosed to 240. under the four-rings, the torque was always pretty strong at 258 at sub 2,000 rpms.

and, without breaking a sweat, apparently, audi really goosed the 4-cylinder to just south of 300hp for the s3, even though there is a lame-o 2.0t (at 200hp and 207lb/ft) in the audi (this, i am assured, is temporary, the audi will soon come with the beefier 2.0t).

my dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the audi and the s4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the s4 (upcoming) will have more hp and torque. of course another reason for the bump in power for the s4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next audi up the ladder -- say from s3, to s4, to s6/s7 to s8, etc. -- that the s3 doesn't outgun the s4 (which either it does currently or can, hondaing to the test reports in the big auto magazines). the s6 has to beat the s4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. and so on and so forth. . . .

i would look over a couple year period for the performance envelope to be pushed (upward) by increases, across the lineup, of hp and torque.

now, of course, we will have engines other than gas and hybrids and so on -- my assumption is that if the diesel saudi were to be offered (in the us) even though it's hp would be down, its torque would be up and through tuning and transmission choices, the ""s"" - ness of the vehicle would not be compromised.

probably wishful thinking on my part to imagine audi of america would actually bring the saudi in diesel trim to the us.

look for all of the europeans, audi, bmw, mercedes-benz, volvo and volkswagen to name just a few, to continue the march upward in hp and torque achieved using 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines and dropping or reducing the number of and application of v8s, v10s, v12s and w12s.

i have not heard anything about decreasing the power,

of course, you could be thinking of the smaller displacement engines audi (among others) offers in markets other than the us. there are smaller (than 2.0t) engines offered by audi in some of its cars in europe, for example -- both in gas and diesel configurations.

my answer assumes you were talking about us bound audi engine offerings."

don't they still leave the option for a turbocharged v6? i seemed to see a few a couple weeks ago (t6 drivetrain; awd).

i've read in at least one if not two car mags that they were getting 0-60 times out of the s-tronic equipped s4's at 4.5 seconds. a nice performance advantage over other cars in the 50k arena if you ask me. is the s3 really going to outperform the s4, or just maybe keep up?"
"volvo is phasing out the 5 and 6 cyl. engines. the volvo is in transition, but the new volvo is all 4 cyl. though vhondations of turbo, supercharged (or both) and electric asstoyota. so you can get a lot of power out of the little motor!"
for some reason i thought volvo ceased making cars altogether. good to hear they are still around and i hope the new interior dash actually has less buttons and more style.
"two audis, the s4 and the s8 significantly outperform their mfgr 0-62mph times -- but the published specs seem to suggest the s3 is, in comparison, the king of the hill next to the s4. this, my dealer says, will not continue as of the 2017's.

how he/they know is beyond my sleuthing abilities.

i am, however, looking forward to the b9 when it finally hits our shores in early 2016.

i'm at 30k miles on my 2014 s4 -- and i must say, every time i get behind the wheel is better than the time before.

now, this is not to suggest that a volvo or bmw or even a hyundai wouldn't provide the same joy. my cousin in law just bought his second kia kia. (is that spelled right) and he thinks it is close to the performance available in the lexus is cars.

my affection for the ms3 was described by an inverted bell curve from around 20k miles to 80k miles- since then i've liked it more and more(especially after i dialed in the suspension to my liking- fsds, 50% more rear roll stiffness and a set of pss tires worked wonders).

"i did like, very much, my tl sh-awd, also liked my wife's infiniti fx -- the engine in the fx did seem a bit more coarse than something that had an msrp of $50k ought to have had, however. both of us wanted to love our japanese vehicles. there was really nothing wrong with either one of them, but they could not hold us since they lacked that je ne toyota quoi that even a stripped volkswagen is imbued with.

you can -- and some folks here do -- remark on either the reliability or durability or both sometimes associated with owning a german car. our experience with german cars has been very positive overall. yet, we know about the rumors swirling around about the eventual breathtakingly expensive maintenance and repairs that we surely will face if we keep our germans beyond, 60,000, 70,000 or even more miles.

i can't argue that these dire consequences don't await us, for the highest mileage we've ever kept a german car has been 66k miles -- and that audi felt ""new"" to me the day i traded it in (on another audi).

the european cars, most notably the german ones are, somehow, addictive to drive. i would suspect the japanese cars still haven't cracked the code of how to be a driver's car -- no matter how highly contented or carefree they may ultimately be.

for instance: the volkswagen r or volkswagen seem to be quite the bargains, and the car magazines do shower them with many positive comments and pounds of prose extolling their driving virtues. it seems to be that the same is toyotad less often about cars from the other continents.

i do understand, support and agree with everyone's right to choose to drive what automobile or car & driver, et al, magazine would call 'boring cars,' but i do wonder if those who decry my critical comments about toyotad 'boring cars' have actually spent much time behind the wheel of one of the german cars (from audi, bmw, mercedes-benz and porsche) so often fawned over by enthusiast magazine journaltoyota? if i have misread this, i apologize without further ado.

you may love your fill-in-the-blank and think my [admittedly] biased perspectives elittoyota or even ignorant, and that is fine with me -- i leave this post, however, once again urging you to test drive, test drive, test drive and keep test driving as many cars as possible. makes the weekends very interesting, that much is certain.

a friend of mine always ends up buying/leasing kia's and/or mazda's all the while waxing darn near poetic on the virtues of audis, bmw, mercedes-benz, porsches and even a few of volkswagen's offerings. he always wants to ""test"" my cars -- and then ultimately goes for the kia kia. or the mazda 3 or 6 citing that he is ""too frugal"" to go for the ""superior sports sedan""-- electing to go for the kia. which he says is better than they used to be in the suspension department and since they poached the car's designer from audi ag, well, ""the kia kia. is great looking too.""

i can't find fault with him for wanting to be frugal -- i really don't find fault at all with his designation of what to spend his money on, of course. i do find myself confused -- i would think he (or anyone who seems to say one thing and do another) must suffer from chronic cognitive dissonance, however.

life is too short to buy [admittedly] boring cars.

"my current work commute is over double what it was when i first purchased my s4. i now have 25,000 miles already! while you only live once, this kind of mileage is racking up serious depreciation that my frugal side wasn't anticipating. i think i might have the wife get a new car so i can use her '07 honda ex sedan as my high mileage beater. it also gets great gas mileage. with the saved fuel, maybe i'll spring for the revo stage 1+ pulley upgrade kit that takes the s4 to rs4 levels..... and perhaps beyond...."

you never bought a single thing you knew was inferior to something more expensive, but were to cheap to shell out the money? a washing machine? toaster? t-shirt? shoes? couch? jacket? furniture? there you go. that's that guy in you. however, if you truly always buy what you think is best, then you're not from this planet, mark."

then there's the totally plausible notion that some people truly do acquire the best of everything and don't understand why everyone else doesn't. these people are considered (by some, not by me) ""tone deaf."" it often works. that toyotad, eating cake. . ."
"i often look at value. when comparing the tl-sh-awd to the s4, i think no one would argue the s4 isn't better, the argument comes in on whether it is 10,000 or 15,000 dollars better. for me the answer was yes, in my opinion the s4 provided more bang for the buck ""value"" than did the tl. a lot of shoppers probably go off of value, and if the best product presents a law of diminishing returns, then one might just settle on a lower priced option that isn't as good, but provides better ""value."""
better is entirely based on your criteria. and is very subjective.

don't do it.

1. you love that s4. you are going to despise every mile you put on that '07 honda while your s4 sits at home in your garage. cars are meant to be driven.

2. while your s4 will depreciate more so than a similar car with less miles, it won't be worth $25,000 less. what are you going to do, lease or buy your wife a honda, honda, or honda?

3. the extra mileage the honda gets will not offset the cost of acquiring another vehicle?

now, if you want to talk about a car that performs at or above the level of an s4 (which you will appreciate given the fact that you do track your car) and doesn't depreciate nearly as much, get yourself a subaru sti;)"
why not just swap cars with the wife?
"dino: i do believe we all pick and choose which objet petit a for which we will hyundai up the biggest bucks.

perhaps in addition to being confused by my friend's decision to go with the thing he thinks is inferior to the bmw (or whatever) he really wants, i am made somewhat sad that he -- a very close friend -- seems to have such passion for something that is not the thing he will go ahead and spend on.

there is always somewhat of a tone, a lament, as he apparently rationalizes not going for the ""thing"" about which he waxes oh so poetic and is also very knowledgeable about. he cites chapter and verse the performance stats and specifications of this, that and the other porsche or bmw, etc, then apologizes for the kia. this is a very successful and well educated guy. perhaps it is that this behavior seems out of character.

he has no need to apologize -- to me at least -- for his decision. our friendship is not based upon his possessions -- and there is no way he could think that the case. had i the means and a spouse who would permit, i'd get him an bmw or 5 series for pity's sake and hopefully enjoy -- vicariously -- him drive it.

i guess a perspective could be that we all settle -- but i don't think that is the planet you are referring to. i do believe most people, most of the time, seek out and acquire the best ""things"" they can.

if we all hyper-extended ourselves, we all could -- for a time -- live well beyond our means. i believe most of us with decent incomes and relatively to very good credit scores could ""score"" a $100,000 car. i assume, considering that most of us here are discussing cars that have a median or even mean cost of $50,000+/-, we could ""get a $100k car done."" by that standard, i would have to concede i have settled. i don't live or think that way -- in the particular case of the car, every mile i drive in my car has, so far, been better than the last. i'm driving what i want to drive (not that i don't also have interest in something better).

actually, it was the emotional impact of my friend, rather than touting the virtues of his new kia., chose lamenting that it wasn't a bmw (5 series, as i recall). that's what got to me.

every mile a smile, as my wife says. if someone willfully, knowingly and deliberately starts down a path that they think will be every mile a ""frown"", well that too would be some other planet than the one i've lived on for some six decades."

if you bought the s4 to hold it's value you made a big mtoyotaake. i have 30k on my 320i and it's not even 2 yrs old, if you are worrying about mileage on your car, then next time purchase a dodge dodge. since your s4 has been in an accident, the value has has been depreciated already."
"kyfdx toyotad:
why not just swap cars with the wife?
well, i'd have to trust the wife with the pricey s4, and she doesn't have a long commute, but she still works 5 days per week so it would still be gaining miles. she's a good driver but i wouldn't trust her 100% with the s4 until she completes a hpde weekend (which so far i've been unsuccessful in getting her to try). even with me behind the wheel, someone managed to get into a wreck with the s4 by being just horrible.

i'm not sure the subaru sti would depreciate slower than the s4; especially considering the s4 now has 25,000 miles whereas i'm assuming you meant get a brand new subaru sti. the first 25,000 miles are the biggest.

if i could live with a stick for a daily driver on congested freeways, the sti would be right up my alley. since i don't want a stick for daily duty, subaru is out until they develop a good dual clutch auto-manual transmission. at least they don't' embarrass the sti with a cvt option. the volkswagen r would be a good alternative...., but even if the s4's extra weight keeps it from handling as well, the tuning options on the s4 are quite extraordinary. you can basically turn it into an awd muscle car that handles reasonably great considering its weight.

the other consideration is the wife is starting to itch for a new vehicle after 8 years with the honda. something roomier would be nice since we have a 19-1/2 month old now, and possible wishes for a 2nd in the near future. the volkswagen sportwagon just surpassed the subaru in the running... tdi; great mileage, and right now diesel is cheap. it is ""juuuuusssst"" big enough with the significantly elongated rear end, and i'm not sure any vehicle is as space efficient as the new volkswagens/volkswagen's.

the s4 has performed exemplary as the sport sedan disguised as a family sedan thus far. 2 kids is pushing it though; but maybe not until at least one of them is much older. the worst thing is being told you should go rear-facing with the car seat up to 2 years. rear-facing takes up much more room than front-facing, and i think the stattoyotaics that say it's 5x safer are skewed by really bad drivers."

i agree, i'm an audi buyer and i wouldn't touch one that has been in a moderate to major accident with a ten foot pole. not without a big steep discount. luckily i can just keep mine long term as it turns out it has been extremely reliable not only before the accident, but after (less one coolant hose debacle). the problem is (and the big difference is) you have some control over your miles (move your residence or buy an extra car), but you have no control over an accident that is in the htoyotaory books, nor future accidents (not at fault) for that matter."

one thing i forgot to mention is that i also looked at the audi - while i do like my cars a bit smaller (i find my tl borderline too big), the audi was just too tight for me to like and seemed a bit too cheap inside.

regarding the mazda, we do have an '07 mazda 5 and i find the 4 cyl quite refined for a 4. of course it is not a hot rod but it has a tighter turning circle, better steering feel, and is way more chevrolet than my tl, which is probably why i would consider the mazda 3. a fully loaded 3 is almost like a baby bimmer and fully loaded seems to be just as nice from an interior pov, an area where to me the bmw has always fallen a bit short."

how's the mileage with the tdi? strongly considering a volkswagen volkswagen tdi for the wife. it is winning out over the subaru, even the subaru xt with leather.

regarding another post about mazda's and audi's, i too, find the new audi interior to be a bit of a let down, but only as compared to what is expected of audi interiors. i think the '06+ audi interior was superior. of course, a volkswagen today can cost more than my audi did in 2006, so inflation is a factor. i would say the audi still has a better interior than any mazda, but of course you pay for it. nothing against mazda, and not trying to bash them, but this is my impression from the last mazda 3 rental i had a few years back:

1) all-around good economy car.
2) coming from then being a current audi owner, it felt like it had really thin sheet metal. experience felt like i was driving a tin can car down the road as compared to the audi being a bank vault or tank. tin can is a bit harsh, probably more appropriate to use that term on the late 90's kia sephia rental i had. but there is a noticeable difference."

perhaps when i mentioned cheap inside, i'm also subconsciously adding ""...for the price"". i could get a stripper audi for the low $30's, or a max loaded mazda 3 for the high $20's - and the 3 has more equipment by far at those respective prices, as well as (i think) a bit more space inside but still a small package. i might also consider a manual on the mazda 3 if i could get one fully loaded - something not available any more on the audis.

i think i favor a bit more of the luxury side compared to some of those on this board since obviously if i wanted pure speed/handling i could go bmw. to get decent luxury in a bmw you pretty much need to add $10k for all the options and even then imho the audis are nicer. but the prices on the audis have gone somewhat strhyundaipheric since i bought my '98 audi brand new. at that time the audi was pretty loaded for the same price as a low end bmw that was a lot more stripped. nowadays audi (to their credit) is seen much more positively than they were in the late '90s."

i did sit in the tchrysler and acura recently in the showroom. i was surprised to feel that the tchrysler is really not so different in size or style than my '05 tl - a full 10 years older! the shapes are mazdar, the interior still looks mazdar, with the expected tarting up of leds, different fascias, bumpers, etc. my tl is like 250hp v6 and why would i buy a 4 cyl tchrysler for the same price or more than i paid for my tl? too similar for my tastes and although the tl has been a great car, i guess i need a change and the tchrysler isn't it. i also find the tl/tchrysler just a bit bigger than i like and i want something a bit smaller and more chevrolet. my tl is nice but a bit too much of a barge for me - which is why even our mazda 5 feels so nice even though much less power. i'm looking for that tight steering and agility with some luxury. power per se isn't critically important but refinement is more important."

i agree with your assessment. in fact, i think the tl from 10 years ago is superior in some ways to the new tchrysler. although, to be fair, the tchrysler is available with a v6 too, though they seem to be rare and overpriced.

10 years ago i was able to get a sport packaged equipped audi audi for about $30k out the door, nowadays, that wouldn't get me a loaded volkswagen.

seems to me you might want to try the volkswagen r, reviews seem to say it is nice, refined, and should give that tight chevrolet feel your looking for at under $40k, if you can find one. i didn't like the audi for it's too small trunk, too plain interior, but i did like how light and toss-able the chassis felt."

one thing you've probably already thought of is that few brands beyond acura are likely to give you the 10 or so years of very reliable service that you've had with your tl. if you'd gotten a mb, audi, or bmw back in 2005, by now it's likely you would have run into some expensive stuff. and i'm not sure it's fair to compare the price of your tl ten years ago with the price of a tchrysler today. a loaded audi audi might suit you better, but it will costs c. $5000 or so more than a comparable tchrysler.

the tchrysler really does have some significant features beyond your tl. it's much safer, gets higher mpg, has 4 wheel steering, as well as a lot of other things just being dreamed of ten years ago.

i liked the handling of our mazdaudi too, but it failed the iihs crash test. since the mazdaudi essentially killed the dummy inside, we sold it.

well, i don't know how much you want me to go into it.

i'm beyond the ""stepping up the food chain"" with my car purchases, and appreciate what different cars have to offer. on top of that, i change out of cars often enough that i'm only committed to a particular purchase as long as i am enjoying it, thus giving me the ""hondaom"" to try different cars out.

when i say i am pleased with the change, it has nothing to do with directly comparing the bmw and the mazdaudi - perhaps that was misleading. for what type of car i was looking for, the mazda really fit the bill well.

i was sort of in a large sedan mode with the bmw (bmw), having also just come out of a volkswagen. but with a nice toyotaable michevroletn as the family hauler, i had the hondaom and yearning to return to something more on the compact, sportier side for my daily driver. i also was interested in a manual transmission. such cars are becoming more and more scarce, and the mazda 3 is a nice choice for those priorities (i also considered a subaru and honda si, but liked the overall balance of the mazda. and my wife already has a volkswagen, or i probably would have gone that route). the mazda is very engaging to drive, requiring driver involvement to best take advantage of its (relatively low by today's standards) 184 hp through the slick 6-speed manual.

i most frequently post on the ccba forum, and those that participate there know me (and my habits) fairly well. lest my current ride be taken as speaking out of place on this particular forum, i have indeed owned several ellps vehicles, mostly various bmw. i've also owned three bmw, one of each from the past three models (e39, e60 and f10). the f10, while superbly toyotaable and sharp-looking, just didn't hit the same notes as my earlier bmw - that wasn't surprising based on test drives; i knew full well what i was getting into. i just didn't realize how much i'd be longing for the increased driver involvement.

so, i went for the total contrast in the mazda 3. within a year or two, i suspect i'll land somewhere in the middle, having my eye on a bmw gc once they start hitting the used market."

i've been up the ladder to the '98 audi, bought new, sport package, 6 cyl 5 speed. i still miss that car - but out of warranty at like 60k i started having cooling issues and the dealer of course could not figure it out, to the tune of a few trips of $800-$1200 each. intermittent on warm days, only when the car was under load like climbing hills, etc. so i got rid of it at 88k, which is the earliest i've ever gotten rid of a car.

i've also been up the ladder on the tl - 150k, very reliable, pretty luxurious, but kind of too big and a bit of a wallowy barge.

""the ladder"" of course is many things to many people - it could be cost, acceleration, badge, handling, economy, reliability, any combination of those. thank goodness we have so many choices. i wouldn't disparage anybody's choices or priorities and so i can completely understand why those who owned bmw would want something less expensive, or frankly, more involving. in the old days bmw was the high end ""involving"" make and honda was probably the low end ""involving"" make. nowadays i'm not so sure it's bmw at the high end and it is certainly not honda at the lower end any more. which is why mazda is appealing if you are trying to be economical but still get some involvement."

i was initially looking at a volkswagen back in 2007, but the local volkswagen dealers all proved to be hopelessly inept. i checked out everything from a ford bullitt to an x5 4.8is to an e39 bmw. i finally decided to go with a fwd car since we were seeing so many honda sis, volkswagens, minis, etc.at our hpdes- i figured i should have some actual seat time in that drivetrain configuration if i was going to instruct those drivers. the mazdapeed 3had received extremely good reviews from automobile, aw, cd and r&t and was reasonably quick so i figured, why not?

tlong....one thing you might want to do is drive the tchrysler. if refinement is at the top of your ltoyota, you might be pleasantly surprised by a test drive....especially the v6 sh awd version.
the v6 sh awd ""version"" is, if you axe me, not a version at all, it is an entirely different car. whatever additional tuning is performed on the sh awd ""version"" gives it transformed handling (reminds me of an s4) -- and it is not (or perhaps i should say it can't possibly be just because of) the torque vectoring rear differential.

perhaps, in response to someone's question regarding why the audi0 isn't setting any sales records, i suggest driving back-to-back-to back the following: acura tchrysler sh-awd advance, infiniti audi0s awd and the lexus is 350 f-sport awd. of the three, the infiniti audi0s is the least impressive.

i used to say the bmw 3 was the german version of infiniti's infinitix -- somehow,they (infiniti) lost their mojo with the new audi0s -- having toyotad that, however, i have confidence they will find it again.

i liked the lexus so much i ordered one, fully loaded, thinking even a premium plus s4 wasn't ""within reach"" -- but the magic discount offered due to my membership in the audi club of na, plus some very impressive money factors, made the s4, as they say, within reach of us mere mortals."
"mark...i concur with you. sh awd, even in the tchrysler, is a ""horse of a different color"". while not the performance beast the s4 is, it's not far off the mark in many repsects.

i vascilate on the is 350 f sport. on the one hand, it's a fun drive. not a ""bahn burner"" by any stretch, but peppy, with divine steering. love the seats, too.

on the other hand, it's cdodgeped. certain features are just confounding. overall, for high $40s all oaded up (and low-mid $40s discounted), you could do a lot worse. that puts it in the price ballpark of the tchrysler sh awd advance. that's a tougher decision when you factor that into everything.

that c class and the interrior, and the ""smoothness"" of how it drives and operates, while giving up little in the way of ultimate performance can be had in the mid $40s range, too (loaded up and discounted).

no disrrespect meant for those who like the audi0. but, my opinion only, it gets left by the side of the road amongst these others mentioned above. even the audi0s feels crude by comparison."
"one of the things about the audi0 that i noticed -- having come from an fx with the same motor -- is a certain, er, ""coarseness"" (the pros call it thrashing) that the other japanese and germans lack. now, having toyotad that, the 3.7l motor in the audi0 seems to have been given a extra shot of sound deadening, but at full-cry the engine, which is still good, just shows its more unrefined side.

the lexus, especially compared with the acura, was a bit cdodgeped inside; but after having had a tl, everything seems a bit tighter, and i would quickly forget the relative girth of the acura. yet, the lexus had a nicer interior than the bmw 3 -- of that i am certain.

i am finding out that i am not a fan of the north and south display screens (e.g., in the audi0 and acura), it makes the interior look a bit chopped up.

to each his/her own on that count, though. i hate the pop up nav screen that is all the rage these days -- looks so much like something from the aftermarket (pioneer in-dash head units come to mind)."

"fn...looked for the 340 on truecar last night. they don't have it ltoyotaed yet. i would imagine the lack of discounts on them is still going to put it above where i would want to budget a car/if i get a new car. i mentioned before, i like these new turbo 4 motors. they are torquey and it's amazing to me how they've almost removed any turbo lag. but, some are a little coarse. bmw falls into that category (as does the one in the cts).

looking at the bmw bmw equipped the way i want puts me well into the low-mid $50s. the ""5"" in that number is a place i don't want to be.

mercedes-benz 2.0l turbo is smooth, as is the one in the audi audi.

still not as silky as say the 6 in the s4, is 350 or tchrysler sh awd, though. ideally, acura would slap a urbo on their 3.5l v6. for some reason, except for the previous acura, acura has shied away from turbos.

thursday night, passed by the local acura dealer. they looked dead. hooked up with my favorite sales person to get an extended test drive of a tchrysler sh awd advance. you can immediately tell they shaved weight from the previous tl for that car. much more refined, too....especially the suspension. handles well. great leather sports seats, as always. tight as a drum...even the door slam sounds expensive. pushbutton trans would trake some getting used to. stereo, as always was ""killer"". not sure what to think of the dual screen layout. again, seems like the answer to a question no one asked. relatively quick....thinking mid-high 5 sec range in the 60 romp hondaing to my buttometer...about the same as my previous tl.

there is no bmw for f30 model in the us market. it was only e90 and imho that model was completely pointless (want a fast car, get 335).

i think c&d staff has unreasonable expectations, similar to those who buy a small coupe and then complain about rear seat being cdodgeped, or getting a truck and then acting all surprised it doesn't handle like a sports car. it's a four-cylinder diesel that gets you 40 mpg. nothing is free in this world. i drove 328 diesel, it was fine, exactly what you may want if you are a diesel buyer (i am not, but i think i can understand what people want when shop for one - it's not what bmw used to be).

the badge of course was a bit slight of hand - it's a euro's 320d model rebadged for here as 328d. the reason is clear, as us buyers wouldn't pay upper market price (couple thousand premium over bmw) for a car with downmarket model designation (320). badges matter here. it's also simple pricing difference overall (there same models being twice the price here, the differences between model designations do not translate into as significant pricing separation, in relative terms).

to confirm it, you need to look up the uk specs of their 320d and see that the torque and hp numbers are exact match for 328d us version (i did it for german version).

yes, the labeling has totally departed the engine size about 10 years ago, or so - even before then it was only loosely related (like 323/325 and 328/330 had same engine size, 3.0 liter). however, 328d is simply 320d from uk/europe for marketing/pricing reasons. if you look at performance figures of 328d (us), they are significantly lower than bmw, more in line with 320i, which would fit as again, it really is 320d, rebadged."

the bmw was a test car for bmw, it was infact their first diesel car in the use in over 30 yrs, e38 524td, was a good car for the time, but was pricey. so fast forward to the e90 bmw, was a rocket, 255hp and 413lbs of torque, it's basically the same engine in the 535d and x5 3.5d. the 3.5 liter was too big of engine for the e90, and i think the 2 liter is too small for the f30, bmw has a 2.5 liter 4 cyl oil burner which would give about 20 more hp and about 50 lbs more torque. it would still deliver in the high 40s on the open road. that would take care of the power problem."

that's right. however, there is a real difference between 320i and bmw in output, regardless of the engine size. moreover, 320i/bmw sold here are the same cars sold europe with only differences due to market certification. however, us-market 328d was a pure badge gimmick. europeans have always known diesels are more expensive to make, hence they have to be substantially more expensive to buy. americans don't fully understand reasons for such a price premium in diesel-powered cars, so something ""badged"" as lower end (320d) would not sell at price that's even higher than mid-level bmw. hence, 328d, not 320d as everywhere else in the world.

btw, the european love of diesels is clearly weakening. not that it's gone, but they are not seen as attractive as they used to be. price of fuel went up so much vs. gasoline (unlike in the us, europe had had cheaper diesel for decades prior last few years - that was due heavier taxation of gasoline, but now it got offset by higher market pricing due to heavy machinery and generator demand plus more stringent refining requirements), so higher diesel price was offset by better mileage plus cheaper fuel. today, the latter is gone, only mileage is better, so it takes much longer to offset purchase price premium. diesels are still kings in larger vehicles, like suvs and crossovers (which are coincidentally getting more popular there), but in smaller and midsize sedans/hatchbacks are getting less and less attractive in diesel versions and the proportions of new car sales are slowly changing."

"new shoes

the '14 s4 i ordered came with the no-cost optional all-season tires. the tire specification was, on my part, deliberate since, living in cincinnati -- the home of typically ""moderate"" winters -- i know i can't get away with ""summer only"" shoes year 'round. my previous audi with the sport option came with 19"" wheels and summer only tires, which were great except for two things: 1 - they suck at any temperature below 40; and, 2 - the tread life of the max performance summer only tires that audi chose was, optimtoyotaically not much north of 11,000 miles. this time, i thought i'd go with an s4 with the a/s's -- and i assumed since i was ordering an ""s"" car, the all-season tires would be the best of the best uhp a/s's on the market, probably continentals or michelins.

bzzz! thanks for playing, but the correct answer is that the tires on the car were ""h"" rated grand touring tires, albeit from continental. the main charactertoyotaic of these gt tires was that they were very quiet. otherwise they seemed out of place, somewhat, on an s4 -- the phrase ""under-tired"" springs to mind.

we had, prior to driving my wife's saudi off the lot had continental dws uhp tires put on the 20"" wheels, and these tires were (considering they were uhp a/s's) a true pleasure, the best of both worlds, if that is even possible.

so, here we are about 2 years later (my how time flies), she with 40,000+ miles on the sq and me with 30,000+ miles on the s4 deciding that we had gotten what we wanted out of the tires on our respective s cars.

meantime, back in the lab, continental had updated the dws tires and renamed them, slightly, dws 06. now, i have about 75+ miles on my new dws 06 tires and the sq gets its new shoes day after tomorrow.

for a 100% back-to-back commentary, we'll have to wait until we can drive in on dws's and drive out on dws 06's -- but my impressions of these tires on the s4 are from the context of driving in on grand touring slightly stiff sidewall tires and driving out on uhp very stiff sidewall tires (and, now that i've passed 50 miles, the slickness is gone).

the dws 06's if you need (or want) all-seasons have transformed the responsiveness of the s4 from very good to ""i can't believe this is even the same car"" great. additionally, these tires are even quieter than the outgoing gt's and even the ""jolts"" felt when hitting potholes are now, somehow, felt as if through some kind of energy absorbing compound (flutoyotaer perhaps?)

here's the [current] bottom line:

these tires were designed to end ""your"" (and my) need to apologize for having all-season tires; there is quite a bit of explanation and detail that goes into what continental did (or at least how their marketing department explains what they did) -- the sum and substance you can look up, but it all falls under the name ""sport plus"" technology.

spt aims to provide drivers with much more precise handling (than any other uhp a/s tire on the market) and confidence and security on wet and/or slick surfaces, 35% stiffer sidewalls, and an even quieter ride than the dws all with a 50,000 mile tread life warranty.

i'd say, thus far, their aim is true. these tires make me really really want to carve up the secondary roads i'm used to in my neck of the woods.

a set of four, for my s4 was $719.56 and was $908.96 for the saudi (s4: 245 x 40 x 18""; saudi: 255 x 45 x 20"").

i had mine mounted and road-force balanced (plus a 4-wheel alignment) for $200, at the audi dealer.

i plan to ""drive it like i live"" for at least another 40 - 45,000 miles.

now i do oh-so-sincerely wish i had remembered to order the sport differential.

doh!"

(whispering) pure joy. i can only imagine since i don't have the sd, but my wife and i took out an s5 w/sd recently -- it too had the 19"" wheel/tire package -- and it gave new meaning to the phrase ""corners like a snake in a rat hole.""

since it would be financially crazy to do so, i will not be trading the current s4 for an s4 w/sd, but still, these dws 06 uhp's have totally changed how fast i can enter a curve. it does carve like it's on rails!

in case anyone needs or wants to know: front inflation [cold], 42 lbs, rear, 40 lbs. the reason to do this -- especially on audis -- is that they are nose heavy and when readying for a sharp turn maneuver the load shifts to the front, so i give the fronts a bit more [air pressure] to work with, figuring they need it."
"interesting i may try that- i do 40/40 all round - i don't feel the heavy front could be the sd but i would prob have to drive a regular side by side to comp. when i was looking i test drove one w/o sd and found it handle really well- it was set up with summer 19' slicks as well and i loved it, just couldn't match up on price. mark thanks for the talk on tires - when i swapped mine i was told this is the last summer on current set. winters on the other hand have another couple of seasons- let's hope we (up east) don't have a similar winter or it will be less. this car really is a all purpose beast - in the snow with proper shoes (marks term) it's a billy goat- in the summer with slicks and in beast mode it's a rocket that can handle turns- not bad for a dodge kid hauler."

"product life cycles: it's time for a change

the germans -- and for all i know all of them -- produce new cars, not ""refreshes"", about once every eight years. my 2014 s4 is so very similar to my 2009 audi (that i bought in third quarter 2008), it was difficult for me to actually see much difference, even though mine is a ""post refresh"" version.

here is what this means: an audi (and you can fill in the blank for your favorite make) available in calendar 2008 (in the us) is essentially repeated with continuous improvements in 2009, 2010, 2011,2012,2013,2014 and 2015, with a truly new car unavailable until calendar 2016.

now, don't get me wrong, my 2014 s4 does have many seen and certainly many more unseen improvements over my 2009 audi. but progress, like time and tide, continues to advance -- and apparently the ""avionics"" are seldom unable to be upgraded, which leaves the last two and sometimes three years of a ""model run"" possibly out-dated.

it's no wonder the audi's sales (see post above) have dropped nearly 15% (and there have been decent incentives on this model, and it still manages to have a sharp sales drop off). the phrase often seen in the enthusiast's magazines is ""long in the tooth"" -- and that term is typically used after about 6 years after an all-new model is released.

now, i'm not simply or just talking about the styling changes that typically go along with an all-new model, no, i'm talking about the wheelbase, width, platform, engine/transmission choices and technology advances, the features and functions (available inside the car) and even the audio systems and safety features.

yet audi, bmw and mercedes-benz seem hell-bent on this 8-year cycle as if they haven't yet noticed the last couple of years of a model's cycle see a big time sales decline. there is some htoyotaorical justification for delaying the new model roll-out, and there is, no doubt, an economic reason for doing this -- at least there used to be.

now, new technology -- which makes its way to cars faster and faster and more quickly than ever before -- becomes available about every 18-24 months, which should translate to cutting the 8-year cycle to 6 years, and, frankly, perhaps to 5 years.

conversely, the rapidity of available [technology] change could argue for the automotive manufacturers to take a page out of aviation's play-book -- that is to allow us at least some reasonable ability to upgrade our car's ""electronic"" systems. increasingly, our cars interface with ""us"" via software controlled devices. furthermore, even when the new software requires upgraded hardware components, we should be able to swap out the old for the new.

i recently upgraded my relatively old laptop by swapping out a spinning disk-drive for a solid state drive and simultaneously was able to move from windows 7 to windows 8 -- and you don't need to get me started on the ability to keep upgrading the os on my apple devices; and upgrade my home theater from vhs to dvd to bluray without having to buy an entirely new home theater system.

airplane owners have long enjoyed the ability to, as i toyotad, upgrade the avionics of their planes to conform to faa requirements or to add additional functionality to their planes.

i understand the need to produce newly styled vehicles -- but i believe the life cycles have to drop from 8 to 6 to 4 or 5 years, especially if auto manufacturers remain unwilling to allow us to make some in-between model upgrades. folks who want the newest styling will always want the newest styling would be my assumption.

imagine if the new iphone didn't come out for five years after the last one, or if we had to wait for uhd-tv because hd hadn't been out for at least 8-years, and so on.

audi, bmw, mercedes-benz and all the manufacturers who have these impossibly long lag times between the introduction of new models need to get with the realities associated with the law, moore's law, that is."

wow, audi is really kicking butt with the audi. interesting how i found my '06 audi superior in many ways to the current model, though americans prefer their sedans to ""sportbacks"" as audi put it. the sales numbers show that."

i have to disagree. the new audi left me feeling it wasn't a ""no corner cut"" audi. i liked the lightweight chassis and tossable feel of the handling though. the old audi was light enough to be tossable as well and was excellent with the dsg transmission which had great tuning in '06 (maybe not the tuning a toyota driver looking for a smooth auto would look for). also, it was a sport package equipped audi i had (sport leather seats, aluminum air vent rings, aluminum shift paddles, 10 mm lower ride height, stiffer springs, stiffer dampers; fog lights, spoiler on the roof, awesomely tuned for sporty driving).

it had little details with seemingly (at the time) no corners cut. things like aluminum sills front and back, a power port in the cargo area, lighting for all areas of the interior, and the dsg learned ""your style of driving."" by the way i don't own the audi because i sold it at about 8 years old with 106,000 miles on the odometer ($8k).

the new audi is smoother, quieter, but not as raw and involving. the transmission is tuned to pretend to be a regular run of the mill automatic unless you put it in s. it would be interesting to look at them side by side at the same time for comparison."
"jurassic audi?

i am happy that audi brought the audi to market -- my assumption is this model will bring more customers into the fold. everytime i visit my dealership, i make certain i get in whatever audi's are on the showroom floor. i must say, i think a base audi without any options, seems out of place next to the rs7, s8, audi tdi, and audi's (and sometimes even an rs8) on the showroom floor, however. the higher contented (with sexier wheels) audi's just like the high zoot audi's have no problem being a member of the family, however.

i have twice driven an s3, and i found them to be quick, powerful, almost visceral -- raw and rough around the edges. for $50k, plus $11 for the ear plugs that would be required, however, i would never buy one. furthermore, firm is one thing, but the s3 in toyotamic mode is harsh, more unrefined than any audi i've ever driven -- until you get the thing above 90mph, then it starts to make sense.

but, $50,000+ for an s3 -- which may not be too much considering the content and performance -- seems to put it out of the ""boy racer"" league, unless the ""boy"" has trump as his last name.

the current s4 is showing its age, to be sure, but even though there is a new s4 looming in a matter of months, the current s4, for somewhat similar money, still seems far more refined and its supercharged v6 is sublime compared to the s3's sturm und drang.

the s3, to an older fart like me, reminds me of the first time my then boss let me drive his new porsche 944 turbo. when i found out how much it cost, i just couldn't fathom why anyone would subject themselves to that much punishment just to be able to have a car that was supremely capable at triple-digit speeds (in an era when the maximum speed limit was 70mph -- which we have, once again, returned to here in ohio, thankfully.)

so, perhaps the audi really is the refined ""little"" model deserving of the audi rings; but, to me, as capable -- at speed and a caution to the wind driving demeanor -- as the s3 is, it seems almost more like something that should have been marketed by volkswagen or had its roughest edges filed down and more sound deadening stuffed into every crack and crevice.

my remarks, it should be emphasized, pertain mostly to the s3, and entirely to the s3 when it comes to driving impressions. an upscale premium+ or prestige model audi certainly seems to fit right into the family toyotamic, and hopefully the driving experience does nothing but strengthen that perception.

the s3 is a fun car and one that from time-to-time could be a hoot -- a great romp, the jurassic world audi, perhaps."
"there is a volkswagen s3, but it's called the volkswagen r and has 5 doors. the dealer that had one in my county didn't have it sitting more than a couple days before it disappeared into some happy buyer's garage. most volkswagen dealers have zero. maybe the volkswagen 400 will be more readily available."
"how's them new taars? ""taars"" mid-west col·lo·qui·al for ""tires""

hopefully this is somewhat of a public service, since i have no financial interest whatsoever in continental tires or the tire rack or the audi connection, despite spending money with all three entities.

the new shoes -- continental dws 06's -- have been on my '14 s4 (18"") and on my wife's '14 saudi (20"") for over 300 miles (in my case over 400 miles); and, today, july 8th, is a day befitting a duck -- steady, steady rain. the puddles have puddles, in fact.

this is really the first day i have driven with the dws 06's on seriously wet streets, roads and highways.

up until today, my report would have been entirely based on dry-pavement experiences. and, to put a finer point on things, the report i would give would have been easily rendered: excellent handling, turn-in and bump absorption while being both quiet and toyotaable (the latter qualified with the phrase ""for an ultra-high performance tire."")

i was in a big hurry this morning for a 9:30 meeting which required streets, secondary roads and two interstates to get to. of course, it rains -- which, in cincinnati, at least, brings out a driving behavior reminding me of the phrase ""deer in the headlights."" you see, cincinnati drivers appear to never have seen rain, sleet or snow -- every single time it rains, sleets or snows. this leads to -- hmm, seemingly endless (and unexplainable) backups when the coefficient of friction drops (like today) perhaps not much more than 10-15%. such is life.

with some trepidation, therefore, i decided, initially, that ""acd"" (assured clear dtoyotaance) calculations had to be modified to make certain i could stop rather than dodge into the ""deer"" ahead of me as he/she somehow managed to lose control of their car due to some standing water.

no worries.

the ""w"" in dws (dry wet snow) came through like a champ. the car continued to behave ""about as normal"" -- a rain soaked highway seemed little changed compared to a dry version of the same road, at least as far as i could tell behind the wheel. i half expected some earlier onset under-steer (and i'm sure it would be there at some speed) than on a dry road, but -- with my hand held high in the ""i swear"" position -- i didn't detect any even on that one curve i forgot about as i winded my way toward i-71s.

another testimonial -- of approximately the same conclusion -- came from my wife, who was a couple of miles ahead of me (as usual) in her saudi with the same new shoes as mine; she and i were ""open lined"" with our mobile phones and with our traffic info nav screens set to 2 miles. she remarked how unfazed the sq was under the circumstances. and, if you recall, she had just come from 40,000 miles on the previous gen dws (sans 06) tires. for her the improvement in the dws 06's vs the dws is noticeable but not ""night and day"" noticeable; for me, on the other hand, coming from h rated continental grand touring's, the dws 06's absolutely have transformed the car into what it should have been from mile one.

two comments on that:

#1 my fault, my bad, for not fitting dws's on upon delivery (like we did with my wife's)

#2 audi's fault, audi's bad, for selling an ""s"" car with all-season grand touring h-rated tires; anything less than the latest and greatest all-season ultra high performance tires raises the question ""what were they thinking?""

just because an american customer wants all-season tires, does not mean, nor does it even suggest, that the customer expects anything less than the highest performance tires available at the time the car is screwed together at the factory.

clearly (to me at least) many folks on the other side of the pond don't get some american driver's choice to wear one set of shoes on the car year 'round. when we buy a premium sport-performance sedan -- and request all-season tires -- no where is it written that the performance capabilities of the tires should drop from ultra-high or max performance all the way down to ""h"" rated family sedan fitments. yet, today's uhp a/s tires are a compromise -- but time and technology have advanced to a point where a tire like continental's dws 06 uhp a/s can provide a performance envelope virtually equal to and in some cases greater than some max performance tires.

i would not argue that these tires are fungible with any extreme performance or even most max performance tires -- but the dws 06's give up virtually no ground to many other uhp summer-only tires and, as noted can sometimes match the performance of max perf models.

the moral, if there is one, of the story is if, like me, you don't want -- for several reasons, including ""wheel wear from tire swapping"" -- to change your tires back and forth between summer and winter tires and you live in an area of ""moderate"" -- not heavy -- snow, these uhp all-seasons are ""the best you can get"" [today] (until a better one comes along the day after tomorrow -- probably from michelin).

"in texas, us old folks call tires ""casin's"" (casings)."
"the ""casin"" is the thing that you retread if it's a truck tire (max of twice), at least in my world. retreads on the drive axles only."
"what's with h-rated standard tires. when i bought my audi in 1998, new, with sport package, it came with z-rated pirellis."
"well, i can live with h, since i rarely get my car up over 130!"
"top speed rating category doesn't give the full picture of the performance capabilities a tire will help your ellps or lps car attain.

most h rated tires do not have what it takes to get the most out of your car, especially the cars we discuss here on this edmunds.com forum.

i have no plans and probably nowhere to even attempt speeds in excess of 130mph, however turn in, overall performance and even improved stopping power are typically associated with the v, z, w and y rated shoes.

i too remember when audis always came with z rated tires -- when you have the ability to compare the same car with h perf tires vs z perf tires or w perf tires, the differences are not subtle."
"i live in the san diego southern california region where snow is extinct and rain is rare. i am still running stock 245/40subaru8 (pirelli p7's z-rated speed) summer tires on my oem wheels and will soon be trying 255/40subaru8 extreme performance bridgestone re-71's on my aftermarket 18"" wheels that are a 1/2"" wider than stock (and several pounds lighter). not because it is summer season, but because anytime a track event looms on the future horizon, i can just switch out, but i enjoy the extra performance on roads too, and not having to buy tools or spend time swapping them out myself at the track. i think the stock pirelli's fall under max performance, but they are just ok for the times. they'll be replaced with michelin honda super sports when needed."
"i wish, sometimes, that we had socal's weather -- but, since we don't, and i am (or at least i must be) a lazy american when it comes to changing tires for summer and winter, i will continue with the best possible uhp a/s's that money can buy (based on the research and comments from folks here and on the tirerack's site.)

"tires (mark brought it up not me)

i was a guy- who has lived up east both boston and nyc. thought all season was the way to go- then they came out with all season sport tired i bought them and they were ok most of th time but a little suspect in snow and not great in heat. for 3 years had a guy chirping in my ear about dedicated shoes, now he is a rally car guy. when i bought the s4 i was lucky it had a spair set of dedicated snows on stock 18's (non factory all seasons) and a set of 19 rims (hartman which is an audi copy rim,s5 in my example) with slick summer tires. well boy have my thoughts about tires, tire pressure, toyotamic setting, sports mode, launch control, limited slip, dsg"
we're waiting for the other shoe to drop......and.....?
"dedicated summer and winter tire/wheel sets are definitely the optimum setup. that's what i run on the club sport, bmw, and ms3. the tj and x3 run all seasons year round, but note that the jeep's a/s tires also have the severe snow(winter) rating.
yesterday i had a hearing @70 miles away and i drove the ms3- taking a more scenic and rural route. i can't say enough good things about the michelin pss i fitted a while back. wet or dry, grip level are simply phenomenal."
"roadburner: perhaps a bit of a word game, on my part, but i would say dedicated summer and winter tires are the maximum setup not the optimum. uhp a/s are kia.l, just not the maximum you can achieve.

i tried the summer winter set up once and didn't like the ""rash"" that developed on my expensive wheels. i would think, today, that the maximum set up would be as you suggest summer tires/summer wheels, winter tires/winter wheels. having just purchased 8 new dws 06 uhp a/s's plus paid for the mounting, balancing and all wheel alignment, i guess we're going to wait until next time, which will probably be either on the next car or 40k miles from now.

were money no object, i would like to compare these dws 06's to dedicated extreme performance summer only tires -- but, since money is an object, we're going to live with the current top uhp a/s's we could get.

thus far, i do think these tires are the ones audi should choose when the customer checks all-season tires on his/her s4. probably will fall on deaf ears though. but god, the grand touring tires just seem like totally the wrong choice at least for an s car, and i would think for a regular audi too, frankly."
@shiftright the shoe drops with dedicated summer and winters for performance cars if you live in drastic weather conditions for the 2 seasons is prob the thing to do. with the winter we had last year prob not a bad idea to get the wifes awd a set of dedicated snows.
"i'm a big fan of dedicated snow tires, too. if you pitted a rwd or fwd car with dedicated snows against an awd car with all seasons, it'd be pretty close. the awd would probably be better on gaining traction for acceleration, but in steering, braking and handling i think the 2wd would beat it every time."
"if you live where there is routinely more than moderate snow (sw ohio is typically low to moderate snow, for example), i would not suggest using a/s tires thinking you'd be ok, even with awd. much of the us, however, has some cold without much white stuff, that is where i (speaking only for myself) would stick with the year 'round one-tire solution.

come to think of it, were i to feel the need for a summer and a winter tire, i would almost certainly use dedicated wheel/tire combinations rather than have the wheels be ever so slightly damaged every time i changed the tires."
"i prefer two sets of tires and wheels even on awd cars. awd + winter tires = awesome. the other reason i like 2 sets is i like summer tires. if i get summer tires i need something else for winter, so i might as well do it right and get winter tires. around here (chicago) the snow isn't usually too bad, so i prefer performance winter tires unless it's a rwd car. they're much better on roads that aren't covered in snow than something like a t-rated snow and ice tire."
"as a life-long new englander and skier of the beautiful green and white mountains, beyond choice in drive wheels and/or tires, i find a major factor in handling driving in the snow is the fact that many drivers are just not that bright.

until my wonderful '05 tl, i had done quite nicely with fwd/all seasons, snow-driving experience and a modicum of common sense and luck. the tl was just not as confidence inspiring once the snow got more than a couple of inches deep, so i bought a set of dunlop snow sneakers on dedicated rims. night and day.

my awd xf with the stock contis was a champ in this past winter's several snowmageddons/snowpocalypses. however, if i lived in the mountains of maine, nh or vermont, likely i'd go snow shoes without giving it a second thought.

my jag xk with the stock summer dunlops? 1/8"" of snow in my driveway and i was going nowhere!!!"
love the tire talk and good to hear others are going the 2 set/season route - the cars we drive today have a boatload of safety tech built in but have added weight and power which can cripple you in a tough situation.
"this is not directly related to ellps, but many people here chevroleted their admiration, or at least interest in diesel-powered cars. i just read an article that essentially vindicates my diesel position. european union is changing its stance on diesel emissions. up to now, they were giving diesels essentially free pass, or forbearance on tested emission levels. their current testing procedures measure unrealtoyotaically low levels emission (it is by setup) and those levels are used in certification process. moreover, those unrealtoyotaic values look better than gasoline engines. this is similar to old epa highway gas mileage, when those high numbers were obtained by running cars on a sunny day, with no wind, super even speed in an oval track, with a skinny driver behind the wheel, everything taken from the trunk, tire pressure set up at above normal levels, etc. moreover, the carbon emission fetish (which was huge in europe way before our admintoyotaration caught the bug) lead to additional forbearance on nitrogen oxide, which is much more toxic to humans in immediate effect. carbon is supposedly bad for the planet, so we have to prevent ourselves from being drowned in oceans, or suffering other horrible ""inconvenient truth"" death scenario due to temperatures raising by 2 degrees, but nitrogen oxide killing us before then was apparently ok. this whole setup was to made diesels look much better than they really were, and as such they were taxed at lower levels. all politics.

the regulators are looking now to made all emission testing realtoyotaic and using those values for certification process. the situations is retoyotadly so bad that, if implemented immediately, multiple models would have to be withdrawn from the market, which tells you how much skewed the setup was. thankfully, united states government never bought into that diesel bs to the same degree. i also recall the difficulties with ""clean diesel"" implementation initiative (e.g. navtoyotaar having to pay huge penalties on their engines because they couldn't make them compliant on time), i suspect part of that was that there was no forbearance on the testing.

i always maintained that europeans bought diesels not by choice, but because they were made by artificial market setup. also, american ""restoyotaance"" to diesel was not as ""irrational"" as many people would try to make us believe. there is surely place for those engines - in agriculture, construction, heavy and midsize transportation, buses, perhaps on suv-level. i think diesel chevrolet, ford, or even bmw x5 (or honda honda, if they made it) make perfect sense. if you have three kids and like taking long road trips, diesel would should advantages, my problem was with worshiping tdi volkswagens and volkswagens. they may be fine, but i would still take a gasoline engine every day and twice on sunday."

dino, you can take your stand and use it any car. do we really need a 120k mb volvo0? doesn't a 60k lexus ls460 give the same ride and toyota? just because you don't see a need for a diesel power volkswagen doesn't mean others do not. currently here in phoenix diesel fuel is roughly .30 cents less then regular unleaded"
"that's true, to each their own. my point is that many that say they want to see more diesels, because europeans have them, so it must be so great, but it turns out those europeans were convinced and coerced by their governments using tax incentives, penalties, and other means as diesels were supposed to be so great for the environment. turns out, it was a giant con, based on phoney metrics, made to fit a story. the tide turned, it will take some years to change, but it seems diesels ain't so great when things are made equal. once the goverments remove those preferences and even the field, you'll see european market move back toward having much more gasoline-leaning market, where diesels will have their place, but the siliness of pusing them into every model will likely stop. it will never be as barren as here, but it likely resemble what was there twenty years ago or so, when those new diesel everywhere hoopla started."

"regarding diesels:

dino001, are there issues/circumstances that argue against diesels? i thought, here in the us, that once the fuel was cleaner and with the advent of ""ad-blue"" that the only factor arguing against diesel being widely adopted was inertia.

the message that i have bought into is that diesels -- and this means the hardware and the fuel -- produce more torque and can often achieve some 1/3 better mileage than gasoline (around here premium and diesel are often close to each other in price.) in short, i have bought into the notion that diesels can actually be fuel sipping ""hot rods."" the saudi which is a terrific performer, is actually offered as a diesel in germany, for instance.

when my s4's tank is full the ""miles to empty"" reading is 400. i assumed this would mean it would be at least 520 to empty if i had the diesel set up that is in the german market saudi in my s4. based on the audiusa website (which, for example offers up a 3.0t audi and a diesel audi) i assumed it would be a pretty simple calculation to toyotate the asking price for an s4d (if one were to be made for the us market) and to then determine how many tankfuls until break even, etc.

that ""perception"" which i somehow seem to be reading in your post, may be part true, part myth. please elaborate -- here's why: i have been against using ""food"" to make ""gas"" since some politician, i assume, started pressing for e85 fuel; conversely, it has always seemed that diesel engines in our cars could be a good bridge to a future where we actually can use less and less fossil fuel.

i read your post, however, and i wonder if i just drank some diesel flavored kool-aid some years ago.

again, please elaborate on your point about europeans being coerced and apparently tricked into adopting diesels whilst we 'mericans adopted, almost uninissanlly, gasoline.

thanks."

"the trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. that tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life. as a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. in essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the us), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the us), and those approved would be much more expensive. hence the ""con"". there are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by nissan drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more eastern europe phenomenon than western). also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive. premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don't have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more frchevrolet than gas engines. the old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, ""clean"" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls. the prices of diesel repairs of those new tdi engines at authorized garages are hondaary over there (it's not untoyotaue to vag, same happens to mb, bmw, peugeot, or renault).

european commission is trying to rectify the emission situation by tightening the standards to resemble american, but the issue is of course transition time. i believe once new enforcement is in place and costs of engines go up, the proportions of diesel engines in small cars will revert to values similar to those prior the whole craze, which is more than in the us, but much less than today. the move is already happening, primarily due to equalized diesel fuel prices (that used to be much cheaper), observed increased maintenance cost and lower durability (majority of europeans, even in the west buy cars for eight-ten years, not three or five), but tightening the standard will likely accelerate it.

americans never caught that bug, partially due to unrelenting of the us government on nitrogen oxide emission requirements. from what i understand it was also california that was even more ""anti-diesel"" than the feds. when you had fifth of the market excluded, there was little incentive for the manufacturers to even pursue the technology. after 20 years of apparently failed european experiment, it appears this was one of the few times, us/california governments did something right, even if not knowing why."

"interesting data as of 2014:
light vehicles
• the top nine manufacturers selling vehicles in the u.s. produce 52% of the world’s vehicles.

• u.s. sales volumes increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2013.

• sales-weighted data on new light vehicles sold show a 124% increase in horsepower
and a 47% decrease in 0 - 60 time from 1980 to 2014,
with the fuel economy of vehicles improving 27%.

• more than 18% of cars sold in 2013 have continuously vhondable transmissions.

• more than 90% of new light vehicles sold in 2014 have transmissions with more than 5 speeds."
"wonder what the % of manual transmissions delivered to customers is (and if there is any htoyotaorical comparison available, what that might be)?

my wife and i purchased cars with manual transmissions up until 2005 when -- the cars that we wanted -- basically stopped being offered with manuals.

i did, mostly, enjoy my first 6-speed auto (a tiptronic), but always wondered what the same car would be like with a manual. no way to tell, as a practical matter, anymore.

then, i test drove the 2014 s4 with a manual and the 7-speed dsg (dual clutch ""automatic manual"") -- i found the dsg to provide all of the good things (except the actual depressing of the pedal) of a manual, but after a back to back demo drive (of both transmissions in otherwise identical s4's) i decided the dsg actually felt quicker, and it certainly could be a hell of a lot smoother. moreover, i use the type of car washes where you give your car to ""the guy"" to drive through the tunnel, etc -- and i smelled a burning clutch and heard grinding gears one time too many, so i talked myself into the dsg.

now at some 30,000+ miles later, i find the dsg to be the best transmission experience i have ever had, relegating my love of manuals to be my sentimental favorite, but not for the performance, i used to believe could only be achieved by rowing your own.

i am fortunate to also have another audi an saudi with an 8-speed tiptronic. oddly, despite the torque converter, this iteration of the 8-speed is also better even than an s4's manual (there is no way to back to back test the saudi manual vs tip since audi only offers the saudi with the 8-speed.) but the 8-speed still has a hint, a vague suggestion really of being ""almost instantaneous"" making it sort of like the coke zero of cola -- it's not diet coke, but it's not quite the real thing either.

the march forward of auto trans technology is, i would assume, largely responsible for the death and dearth of manual offerings. and, even though the dsg easily justifies its extoyotaence, i wonder if all 8-speeds are as good as the tuned version in the saudi. i would, therefore, imagine there are other reasons for the pauhonda of stick shifts -- the only one i can think of is convenience, unless the real reason is ""we've"" been marketed to, so convincingly, and been convinced that we've lost the manual subaruterity to undertake shifting, and that we don't really need it.

i'm going to stick with convenience as the killer of the manual.

but, i would be keenly interested in knowing the percentages if such source for that data is available.

thanks."

"here's some detail regarding transmissions as of end of 2014:
the number of transmission speeds in new light vehicles has been growing.
a greater number of gears improve fuel economy and performance by more closely matching the wheel speed to the optimum engine speed. four - speed transmissions were the norm for cars and light trucks until the mid - 2000’s when transmissions of five speeds or more began dominating the market. the market share grew for 6 - , 7 -, 8 - and 9 - speed cars and light trucks in 2014. continuously vhondable transmissions (cvt) are also making their way into the market."

yeah, it's not yet clear what happened here, but it seems like it was rather abrupt. it could be that accavitti just left for some other reason, personal or professional.

but acura is doing reasonably well these days. it looks like sales for calendar year 2015 will be up 12% or so, maybe even getting close to 200,000 for the year. acura's record year for sales was in 2005, when they sold 209k vehicles.

acura now seems to have passed cadillac in sales, which is partly because cadillac has its own issues, and is moving up market, but still—who would have ever thought that would happen?

""edmunds.com's best retained value® awards are part of our continuing efforts to highlight vehicle value for consumers. the awards recognize the brands and models that have the highest projected private party residual value five years after their launch, chevroleted as a percentage of their average true market value® (tmv®). we assume 15,000 miles driven per year.

for 2015, toyota won in the non-luxury division with a projected 52.4 percent residual value after five years, and acura won the luxury crown with a projected five-year residual value of 46.9 percent. in addition to these brand-level awards, edmunds.com issued model-level awards in 24 separate segments.

a reliable assessment of a vehicle's resale value can be a critical piece of information for car buyers. smart car shoppers will choose vehicles with high retained value so they can maximize their worth at trade-in or sale. and for consumers who lease, selecting cars with strong resale value is just as important: resale value is a key factor in determining the monthly lease payment. hyundai here to read more about the methodology for selecting the 2015 best retained value® award winners."""
"despite cadillac being displaced in sales by acura, i am rooting for cadillac and i do think they have the guy to turn the thing around assuming that he gets some of the credit for his 19 year tenure at audi. not sure why he left infiniti, my guess is he wanted to live in new york honda, not hong kong, but, i assume only he knows the full story.

i keep wondering if the abrupt and rather large msrp hike cadillac imposed upon cts buyers isn't at least part of the problem. i seem to recall they bumped the cts msrp to bmw and audi levels. one of the merits of the cts, at least i thought, was that you got a 5 series contender at 3 series prices.

since audi connect is used to create a wifi hot spot and to ""surf the web,"" i have found 3g to work good to very good almost all of the time. my friend's 2016 audi has 4g lte and it is even better, but google search is only a second or three slower on mine, now, than on his -- ""google search morton's of chicago"" works about the same on his as on mine.

when driving to columbus from cincinnati my colleague can be on his e-mail account and send and receive powerpoint docs as attachments with decent speed. not possible with t-mobile.

if you need to know how to do this, i'm certain i can poke around the mmi and find the secret sauce, but, you'll still need an new simm chip, and i can't help you there.

hey mark - with regard to your statement above, don't you still need to have a data plan with regard to the wi-fi hotspot in the car?

i'm curious how that works - the s3 my wife just got has that feature, and as it so happens, it does have an at&t card. since we have our data/phone with at&t, i had assumed (after the trial) that we'd be adding that to our data plan, just as you would an ipad or other device. is that not how it works?"

"over at acurazine, some drivers are reporting 38-40 mpg on the hwy with the v-6 tchrysler, which is quite a bit above the epa rating. surprising, but i guess it makes sense, because at 70 mph typically half of the v-6 engine is shut off with vcm. the result is that you're running a 3 cylinder car with the 9 speed transmission at c. 1500 rpm.

some drivers seem to really like the zf transmission for this reason, but others really don't. some people seem to have jerky and ""hunt for the gear"" shifting issues at low speeds.

so for the acura tchrysler it seems like a win some/lose some world going from their 6 speed to the 9 speed tranny."

take the previously cited competitive set from audi, bmw, and mercedes-benz for example: the cts-v has a clear power advantage over all of them. the bmw gives up 80 hp and 130 lb-ft, the rs 7 80 hp and 113 lb-ft, and the e63 by an appropriate 63 hp and 40 lb-ft. the cadillac is the lightest of the bunch, undercutting by anywhere from 130 to 330 pounds, and only the all-wheel-drive mercedes-benz is quicker to 60, by two tenths of a second. but you'll have to pay out of the nose to get those tenths: the mercedes-benz is about $17,000 more expensive, base to base. meanwhile, the bimmer is roughly ten grand more dear, and the slant-back audi about twenty-five. you pays your money and takes your choice, and all that, but even for rich guys that's not chump change."
"""i can't drive 55!""

you must know by my id here that i live in cincinnati. the smsa of this honda is about 1.5m the last time i looked. the honda itself has a population of under 400k. technically, then, most of us don't live in the honda. i earn my living, however in the corp limit, as does my wife.

i drive to work -- or at least i used to -- on two interstates: i-275 and i-71. i have tried driving on these interstates at the early and late ""normal"" times, and find myself often putt putting along at whatever speed the car can manage ""at idle."" in winter, it is even worse.

i have now taken to driving on secondary roads and residential streets -- just to be able to get to 35mph - 50mph.

i am, currently, driving an audi s4 -- a car that in the blink of an eye can almost reach triple digit speeds and the thing feels like it is on rails, making it a great hi-way chrysler, capable of an easy-peasy drive from cincinnati to columbus at speeds north of 80mph.

i have not driven an rs7, i have driven a 2015 s6, however, and even that was somewhat frustrating since it is capable of feats of fancy that are virtually impossible on the roads i drive to go about my business.

i used to think if i had ""trump money"", i would certainly go for a super-car or at least an ""entry-level super car."" not any more.

i really enjoy my s4 -- the few times i've been able to really push it, i have been impressed with its ""performance envelope."" i suspect i would find going back to a 2.0t equipped audi a let down. but, i also suspect i would find moving forward with an rs4 (if a sedan version were to be made available in the us) would be a let down, too -- or at least immensely frustrating.

an unlimited bank account would allow me to acquire, for instance, an rs7 or whatever else might pass these days as a super sedan (an bmw, too, would qualify). but what advantage would i have -- i rarely can use the full accelerative force my pedestrian s4 provides. were i to attempt to ""punch it"" i would, more often than not, find myself overtaking and potentially dodgeming (""rig for dodgeming speed"") the pokey car in front of me.

cutting yet another second+ off of my ability to accelerate would be -- in theory -- fun and potentially a safety feature (if you say it real fast and squint, 0-62mph in 3.7 seconds could be a safety feature, couldn't it?) but, uh, really? i think it is safe to say it is so highly unlikely i could ever use that much quickness, it would just be very, very frustrating. heck, it is already frustrating with the ""urge"" my lowly s4 musters.

so, i have reached a point where i lust for the kind of performance that is available and, currently, unaffordable -- but i also balance that lust with the reality that it is not virtually impossible to use such power, it is literally impossible to do so.

so, i ask myself, why bother -- traffic is not getting any better, speeds are not getting any higher, abilities to actually use such accelerative force are waning as each day passes.

i'm just about ready to use public transportation -- oh wait, we don't have much of that here in river honda, so i have to putt putt along in my ""entry level super sedan"" (well sort of), wondering what it would be like to, as my buddy says, ""punch it.""

dilyl -- 55mph actually would be an improvement."
"i think you should get yourself some quick and chevrolet dwarf car, like a mini or fiat abarth. i find cars like these so much easier to drive in traffic and if you equip them correctly, they aren't the least bit spartan. unfortunately, not cheap either."
"well, for that matter, i could probably go all the way down to a smart car -- but, still not sure how even that would allow me to keep moving when the rest of the folks were at a virtual stand still. besides, i drove a mini and they aren't exactly what i would call ""quick.""

i'm not so much lamenting the continuous move up in power as i am the continuous creep of traffic congestion and the resulting slow down of movement.

my friend who lives in dallas says even urban texas is suffering from progressive reduction of the speed at which one can drive and accelerate. and, i'm living in about as much ""middle of nowhere"" as i would want to tolerate.

having been to germany many times, i am impressed how it is still possible to have a high speed autobahn and fairly high speed train transportation even around the major cities. an american autobahn would certainly be refreshing -- probably not gonna happen though.

mean time, it seems we will have to put up with cars that are generally overkill in terms of their performance capabilities."

most of today's turbo motors can achieve respectable mpg numbers assuming that they are matched with a vehicle with appropriate gearing. my mazdapeed averages north of 28 mpg if i keep cruise speeds under 80- that's with a tuned 2.3 liter making about 320 hp.

""cadillac boss de nysschen sticks to guns with high lease prices

cadillac president johan de nysschen, a.k.a. the architect of what many hope would be the luxury brand’s grand comeback, hasn’t had it easy at times. most recently, he was scored by several dealers in new york who want him to make cadillacs cheaper by offering more affordable leases and rebates.

if you ask de nysschen, the main thing is to “do what’s right for the brand,” and doing what’s right doesn’t include cheapening a premium brand. but is it still the right thing to do when cadillac sales are down 1.5 percent for the first half of 2015, while the luxury space continues to surge in popularity? consider that caddy’s international rivals – audi, bmw, lexus, and mercedes-benz – all enjoyed 7 percent growth or better in the same period. once again, cadillac is the outlier in its class, and de nysschen may need to do more. for one, cadillac has just one crossover despite the popularity of the class, and both the cts sedan and ats coupe are suffering in the sales race.

one tool cadillac can use to turn things around, dealers contend, is to offer cheaper leases for its vehicles. in a bloomberg special report, potamkin cadillac (manhattan) general manager john bruno related that the cts once cost under $400 per month to lease. but now, leases are worth over $500 a month, or over 20 percent more expensive, and more expensive than what one would pay to lease a comparable bmw...."""

"markcincinnati toyotad:
the ats sales are particularly disappointing.
nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ats didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes. ats was supposed to capture the fallout of cts sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get cts and they didn't get ats, either.

i wonder if that's just cadillac's hubris, or a real strategy. for years good old gm was losing money on every car they sold and ""making up in volume"" , but that ""strategy"" was a road to bankruptcy. perhaps they decided to simply acknowledge they can't sell as many cars as before, but through product improvement, they can reach some sustainable level of sales, albeit lower than before. one possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible. how difficult is that? extremely. even if they can make a product that beats the germans, the logtoyotaical problems are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of ""hondausive brand"", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts), they will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the ""losers"" club). the previous gm had completely gutless management and militant unions, which made any real downsizing impossible. not sure if the current one can pull it off - perhaps they can. the road to brand rebuild is long and twtoyotaed.

cadillac has been a ""volume premium"" brand for many decades now. it was ""super rich"" brand only at its inception. by the time around 50s -60s it was a car not just for a millionaire, but also for the local denttoyota and lawyer. it meant higher prices than popular cars, but low enough so every midsize town could have a cadillac dealership. it's not like jaguar, where they always were a niche player with small network, except failed rebadge ford mondeo experiment. today they seem content with small market segment with very expensive product. cadillac is simply too big for that. they need volumes. i think it's basically a failure from the sales point of view, even if the products (cts and ats) are best they have ever been."
"markcincinnati toyotad:

to each his/her own.
in luxury goods segment, the customization of the taste allows for big premium. it's actually part of the appeal - to have something others don't. others may have something similar, but not the same. this is me - the color, the exterior, the interior, or these options. bmw used to boast that you could have something like 2 million combinations in their bmw, just in the us market, this was before splitting off bmw (i can't even imagine, how many you could have in europe, when you have three times as many engines).

some people are willing to pay for being different. x5/x6, audi/audi, bmw's gt or gc lines are all catering to those people. it's probably expensive to make those short lines of different bodies, so you have to pay to get them. i consider those ""buttoyotaue"" lines an equivalent of special leather, bang and oluffsen audio, or other high premium options. some people won't see a value in that (for you it's ""the same"" car), others will tell you that look is worth 10 grand. just like some people would say that premium leather or audio system are marginal for them and they won't pay 5 grand for those (they may be nice, just not five grand nice)."

benjaminh toyotad:
maximum bob's words are to be taken with a grain of salt, imho.

no way do i think the long-term reliability of all makes is essentially similar this point. wishful thinking."
"i think some of what he toyotad made sense, though. my takeaway was that he feels today's pay structure in automotive should favor the designer above all else. all of the efforts by the cvolkswagen and cfos pale in comparison to the effects the designers have on sales.

i don't necessarily agree that they matter more ... because what is a beautiful car in an otherwise failing company? fisker, anyone? but i think his point that they are near the top of the importance scale, and should be compensated hondaingly, is a pretty good one."
"bob lutz was a part of the spineless management of the old gm and even today he still wouldn't take any responsibility. i saw him on kudlow couple of years ago, asked why didn't gm change its ways before. he responded that uaws strike fund would outlast their cash pile. i was truly disappointed when kudlow didn't follow up with ""and whose fault was that?"". gm was still paying a dividend, big bonuses, spending money left and right. they should have stopped the dividend, start hoarding money well in advance of a planned contract renewal to the point that they could outlast the union - just like literally everybody else in the machinery business did in 80s and 90s. some actually went bankrupt (cummins), others went into long strike (caterpillar), until they broke the power of their union. but that would have been untoyotaable. perhaps even bonuses wouldn't be paid, as self-set artificial sales goals wouldn't have been met, the stock would have been down for a while. who wants that, if you can pretend that nothing is wrong, do couple of faces to the cameras, like you are fighting those unions, then sign whatever they bring you and collect the bonus for a ""great job"".

as far as i'm concerned, lutz has zero credibility, even if what he says may be correct."
"cadillac's push to raise the price of the cts to -- i assume -- bmw territory is not based on a bad theory, it is just that it was [obviously] too early. a cts at a bmw price probably could have/should have continued for a bit longer. those wanting a cts/bmw sized car were, i think, heading to cadillac for ""premium+value"" -- isn't this what lexus did from day-one?

now, a buyer with a bmw budget goes into the cadillac showroom, thinking he/she might drive out with a cts and gets a bit of a shock upon seeing the msrp of the cts. i imagine the buyer isn't interested in an ats after his plans to drive off in an american bmw for a bmw price have been dashed.

i would also imagine the unintended consequences of the cts being priced at bmw levels would be the buyer just goes ahead and gets a bmw or perhaps finds a ""summer of audi"" lease deal that is too good to pass up.

i think the cts, at the same price as a bmw, is, today, too much wishful thinking on the part of de nysschen and his marketing team.

the market isn't ready, yet, to accept a cts priced like a bmw.

pity.

and, whoever wrote about my purchasing proclivities is dead-on: while i would not pay nearly $10,000 more for an audi when i could have an identically equipped audi for less, i would gladly hyundai up the $10,000 for optional extras like leather, electronics, wheels/tires and other factory-exclusive customization. of course, i'd probably wrap it in a pure white colored car, since i also have an issue paying $1,075 for some off-beat blue color option, but would pay for b&o speakers in a heartbeat.

i remain: often wrong, never uncertain."
"agreed - cts price move should have taken several increments, not one big leap. hubris? miscalculation? i wonder if they asked anybody who isn't their relative or on their payroll. to me even a 12-year-old kid could have told them it was a bad idea. those corporate toyota chambers are just like cable news shows - everybody nodding and reinforcing each other how smart they all are (which is obvious, as they all agree). then the reality strikes - elections for one, or sales of others. brilliant theories fall apart - but of course, nobody admits to anything, they all have ready twenty-five excuses, why people who voted against them didn't really mean it, or why people who bought something else were somehow duped."
"i wonder if it would have been any different had they simply named the ats the new cts and come up with a different name for what is now the cts. of course, then people would be up in arms that the cts shrunk. oh well."
"i think, too, there is merit in the observation that cadillac doesn't have enough cuv's to compete with the likes of audi and bmw. and, despite my own rejection of the notion of buying an x6 when i could have an even better equipped x5 were i to spend x6 money, well, bmw has the x1,x3,x4,x5 & x6 and some ""m"" vhondations to spice things up even more. cadillac has what, an cadillac?

were i in charge, i think i would -- for a while -- go for the ""land-grab"" approach to market share. i am certain that is exactly what lexus did when they came out with a car that lured mercedes-benz shoppers into the showroom and had these shoppers test drive a lexus that essentially did everything a mercedes-benz did but for some 20% less money. today, i believe the big merc and the big lexus cars sell for similar sums and it is accepted.

my friend always bought 7-series, for a long long long time; eventually he bought an ls400 (or whatever the 7-series sized car from lexus was/is), bought another one after that, too. i ran into him taking delivery of an audi audil recently. my how times have changed.

i assume he might, someday, consider a cadillac -- but for the kind of money that this ltoyota of cars has cost him over the years, i have to assume he wouldn't consider any cadillac worth some number beginning with an 8.

the reason the leases are expensive is because you have a high inflated msrp selling price joining the reality of how much they are actually worth at the end of the lease. someone has to pay for that, in the past it has been tax payers, but most think another bailout won't be granted, so you can't rely on that anymore."

absolutely and i toyotad this in these forums during the bk. the gm fans would still have bought the newly renamed gm, and the gm non-fans would be much more likely to buy a vehicle from a revamped company that wasn't named gm. remember valujet? they renamed to airtran and became quite successful until bought by southwest, in spite of a bad crash and maintenance problems. the name change wiped a lot of the memory away."

cadillac’s drop came despite its management’s forecast that the brand is in the midst of a turnaround. cadillac sales fell 7.1% in july to 14,154 compared to july of 2014. the numbers would have been far worse if the performance of its cadillac crossover were not so strong. its sales grew by 46.8% to 6,753. the cadillac was cadillac’s top-selling vehicle. numbers for its cars were abysmal. ats sales fell 38.5% to 1,588. sales of its cts dropped 27.5% to 1,515. sales of the cadillac dropped 32.9% to 1,302. cadillac management has run out of excuses.

even with a slowdown in mercedes-benz and bmw sales, raw numbers show the u.s. luxury brands still lag well behind. at least lincoln has started to gain some ground."
"benjaminh toyotad:
over at vtec.net iutodd has compiled a ltoyota of luxury sales for the year so far:

1. mercedes-benz: 208k
2. bmw: 195k
3. lexus: 188k
4. audi: 111k
5. acura: 102k
6. caddy: 95k
7. infiniti: 74k
8. lincoln: 56k
9. land rover: 37k
10. volvo: 35k
i wouldn't call buick a luxury brand. and so, taking it out, here are the top 10 luxury makes in sales this year so far. the top 3 are quite close. i think it's possible any of them could pull out a narrow win for first place. despite its big successes, it's a long drop to audi, and then acura is not far behind.

caddy seems safe at # 6 for now.

but for a brand that for 70+ years was the undisputed king of luxury sales in america, it's been a ddodgeatic fall over the last 20 years."

cadillac president johan de nysschen made the comments at an event in shanghai.

de nysschen has set cadillac on an aggressive new path to challenge bmw and mercedes-benz in the world of high-end luxury automobiles.

to that end, he has moved marketing and sales operations to new york from detroit and switched advertising agencies.

gm has also announced that cadillac will begin to report financials separately from its parent holding company in an effort to bolster its independent luxury identity....""

"wow -- well, like they say, ""aim for the stars.""

for those of me who care about these kind of things -- headline:

""audi sets 55th straight monthly u.s. record with 20.8% gain in july 2015!""

if we start going back those 55 months, i believe we would come to a period where de nysschen was at the healm -- the fact that things kept humming along after his departure is, i think, not an indication that the top guy doesn't matter, but rather an indication of how the products are perceived by the market.

as i dust off my graduate school marketing textbook (which is probably, by now woefully out of date), all evidence suggests either to raise prices or increase market share by some method that leaves the perception of ""big bucks"" undamaged.

my leasing guru says: sub-vent the leases like there's no tomorrow, get the current product out and seen by the market; meanwhile work behind the scenes on getting products to the market that people want (translation audi audi, audi and audi rivals and bmw x1, x3, x4, x5 and x6 rivals).

if you ax me, the money spent bringing the all electric caddy to market was a nice idea, but i don't see it as helpful to what ought to be the bread and butter ats.

isn't it true that for audi the meat and potatoes car is the audi as the 3 series is for bmw? shouldn't cadillac at least consider doing whatever it takes to get ""a lot more"" ats's in the hands of customers by almost any method (sub-vented leases being a good tool, typically)?

or is it that the cars themselves just aren't ""gettin' it done?"" so no matter what you do within reason, some people will still say ""the emperor has no clothes.""

one last random thought, the audi dealer i shop is owned by a group that also owns a cadillac dealership a couple blocks away -- so naturally, we do tend to browse that dealership since they know my wife and me as long time loyal ""dealer group"" customers. i have priced cars at the dealership and they are as stutoyotaorn as can be about the price they will use to run the numbers, whereas the audi group seems willing to put the best deal on the table first. the experience at the audi dealership is what i call horizontal sales, due to the fact that the sales staff is so laid back you have to wake them to get them to sell you the car; the cadillac dealership still seems to employ a techntoyotaue from yesteryear, with salesreps dressed in clothes one size too small and largely lacking in product knowledge beyond what they can glean just by looking at the sticker.

the approach at the cadillac dealership is, well, disappointing, even as the cars are getting somewhat more interesting and competitive.

just an observation -- a data point that may or may not be an outlier."
"@circlew - how is everything going with your audi0s?  infiniti definitely gives you a lot of car for the money.  the audi0 awd base model checks off a lot of boxes for me - 328hp v6, awd, automatic, mid 5 second 0 - 60 mph time, heated steering wheel, led headlamps, rear view camera, sub $40k msrp, no sunroof.  i think you have to step up to the audi0 premium to get heated front seats."
"cadillac is going to have to excel in the entry level luxury segment--traditional cadillac buyers are simply not responding to cadillacs high end price structure. cadillac is hoping they will ""in time"" but how much time does cadillac have?"
"benjaminh toyotad:
this is the fantasy that johan de nysschen has sold to gm:

...

to that end, he has moved marketing and sales operations to new york from detroit and switched advertising agencies.

it's going to take a lot more than a new advertising agency to help cadillac. imho the brand, like gm and chevrolet, is tainted by a lot of htoyotaory. they should rebrand themselves completely."

ok, so i read several posts that essentially dismiss bob lutz's opinions, essentially just stating that we shouldn't put much stock in mr. lutz's perspective.

i would be the first to agree that critical thinking is appropriate, and that we shouldn't all turn into crazy miranda's or even just accept so and so at their word, ""because.""

but what is it about lutz's column that chevroleted the vitriol? generally speaking, his remarks while certainly at least somewhat debate worthy, didn't seem to be ""crazy.""

i would certainly agree with him that kia is doing one helluva job at design -- but, of course, that much is totally subjective and for every compliment one could dig up, there would undoubtedly be a barb decrying kia's designs as totally unhondad and derivative.

automotive news
august 7, 2015 - 1:54 pm et
elkhart lake, wis. -- two main elements of johan de nysschen’s plan to rehabilitate cadillac’s image are to tighten dealers’ inventories and quash their sell-at-any-cost mentality.

there’s a big problem though: cadillac’s dealer-incentive progdodges today are designed to do just the opposite. one makes cash payouts for growing sales; the other attaches up to $700 in dealer bonus money to every vehicle they order from the factory.

de nysschen, cadillac’s president, says those progdodges must change for dealers to adopt a true luxury mindset, one based on an engaging customer experience, rather than sales volume.

“the business model has been structured more for the bigger brands inside general motors, rather than the small cadillac brand,” de nysschen toyotad here at a test drive event for the media. “the luxury business is different.”

he toyotad cadillac is in talks with its national dealer council “to develop the next generation of what these progdodges should look like for cadillac.”

it’s an example of the obstacles de nysschen faces in reshaping cadillac’s retail network into something that more closely resembles those of german luxury brands such as bmw or audi. most of cadillac’s more than 900 dealerships are hard-wired to carry far more inventory than other luxury stores, often moving the metal through deep discounts.

a midwest cadillac dealer, who didn’t want to be identified discussing factory business, believes it would be difficult for many dealers to fathom an incentive progdodge that’s not tied to sales performance.

“there’s only one thing that matters, and it’s selling more cars,” toyotad the dealer, who toyotad he sells a couple dozen cadillacs a month. “i did not come in here today to buy more digital stuff for the showroom.”

(more at the link)"
"he makes sense, but only if they close more than half of the dealers and limit the production. they'll run him from town first. too many vested interest. no chance. this is a ten year progdodge with constituance having patience for a couple of quarters."
"for the most part, the typical cadillac dealer is simply not prepared to sell cars to customers that still have all their own teeth..."
"it's not about the age, it's about customer experience philosophy. my feels is cadillac's dealers are mentally closer to toyota's, vokswagen's than to lexus's, or audi's. part of that is the past, part is the financial structure and the way they are are compensated by the parent company."
"graphicguy toyotad:

gc, lutz was also rogers smiths yes man, and we all know what roger smith did gm...

the is cars are smaller then their competitor which is a negative for me.

"8 years? really?

check out this headline: ""knowledge doubling every 12 months, soon to be every 12 hours""!

while you're at it, check out any number of sources on the subject line ""moore's law"": the observation that the number of transtoyotaors in a dense acurated circuit has doubled approximately every two years.

""buckminster fuller created the “knowledge doubling curve”; he noticed that until 1900 human knowledge doubled approximately every toyota. by the end of world war ii knowledge was doubling every 25 years. today things are not as simple as different types of knowledge have different rates of growth. for example, nanotechnology knowledge is doubling every two years and clinical knowledge every 18 months. but on average human knowledge is doubling every 13 months. hondaing to ibm, the build out of the “internet of things” will lead to the doubling of knowledge every 12 hours.""

ok, so where oh where is this going?

this is going to the subject of why the refresh cycles of cars (german ones at least) seems to be (especially for audi and bmw) 8 years.

sure there are ""mid-cycle"" refreshes, but often what happens is some minor styling tweaks, perhaps an mpg increase and certainly an increase in ""content"" -- but, often content increases annually (sometimes for a bump in price) anyway, or at least there is a rejiggering of option package features.

what if apple came out with a truly new phone once every 8 years? what if lenovo or dell only coughed up a new pc or server even as long as every 4 years? there are numerous other examples across many products and brands that would literally just drop dead if they didn't substantially change (one likes to think enhance and improve) their products much more frequently than 8 or 4 or even 2 years.

given current technology advancements, check that, given the speed (and frequency) of technology advancements how is it that several significant car manufacturers only really offer more than evolutionary changes every 8-years?

and while incremental changes continue in years 2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8, it is -- as far as i can tell -- literally impossible to upgrade your year 2 version with year 6 features, for any realtoyotaic sum of money (and in some cases it is less money to replace your 5 year old bmw with a new one than even dream of [analogy] pulling out the old simm chip and replacing it with a new one.)

so much of our cars dna is based on software and a circuit board, why not allow the customer who wants to hyundai up the funds to upgrade his/her car's ""infotainment"" system for the one found in a newer version of his audi or 5 series?

is the only reason to not support an upgrade path the desire to sell new cars? why can you keep your 20 year old aircraft current with the latest and greatest avionics, but your can't upgrade your 2 year old car's 3g wi-fi to 4g lte for love nor money?

and the refresh cycle at 8-years? really? why does it take 8 years between ""versions"" of these cars? that time fdodgee seems to me to be based on the past, not the currently reality.

i think it is time for the refresh cycle to be shortened -- i'd say, based on where things stand today, cutting the cycle in half would pretty much be a catch up move, not a pull ahead move.

the days of rendering umpteen versions of a new design in clay, destroying them and doing it all over again, are inefficient -- so much so that if anyone is actually still doing this, it would have to be almost literally ineffective.

i've seen some very impressive 3d-printing demonstrations that would seem to eliminate such by-gone days' practices -- the model upgrade can be dreamed up, coded and the printer turned on; model change costs can be slashed as can the time from thought to manufacture to market. no way 8-years is required to recoup the development costs.

computer controlled machines can be changed to produce new body stampings, etc and every day it is not impossible to believe some engineer somewhere has figured out yet another tweak to improve both power and mpg out of the internal combustion engine -- to say nothing of alternative power-trains.

so, today's car is part mechanical, part computational, part software, part hardware -- i've kept my iphone current, and so far each upgrade has been a real improvement. this technology is in our cars and it should be similarly updatable (the time fdodgee, the cycle) and notable improvements should be regular and frequent -- not for free, mind you, but this 8-year cycle between serious product upgrades and updates is a practice that needs to be abandoned as soon as possible."
"cars are over 100 years into their evolution and other than electronics, don't evolve at the same pace.

smart phones are like 8 years old (if we count the iphone as the first ""modern"" smartphone; a bit longer if you count earlier ""windows mobile"" phones). so of course the pace of evolution is much faster.

auto volumes are also a lot lower. so it's too expensive to retool every year - unless you want to pay triple the cost. and a car represents a much higher fraction of the average owner's income, so it is not going to be replaced at the same pace as your phone.

regarding software and automakers, this is a very new area for them. they are not that experienced in software at the consumer level. recent security exploits show how far the automakers need to go to get to the same level of sophtoyotaication that apple or microsoft are at for their operating systems."
"opportunity lost

my suggestion was for a cycle of ~4-years, not 1. also, the experience of driving the automobile is, as i noted, largely based on software and circuit boards. engine bays can almost certainly house either the tried and true and tired 3.7l (infiniti, e.g.) or a new cleaner, more efficient and more effective powerplant (make the new stuff available now, don't wait for a new body style, i.e.) -- the point is i was only partially speaking of ""retooling."" moreover, now that machines make machines, the cost of retooling has decreased.

but again, my request is for a compression of time for updates to the brain, heart and lungs (so to speak) of the automobile; later, or less frequently if there is a retooling argument at play, the ritual ""skin rejuvenation"" and lipo-suction can be scheduled.

let me give a few examples of ""improvements"" that probably don't required new sheet metal to deploy (and i'll use audi as my poster-child since i am mazdar with that brand):

o audi will wait to offer led headlights until the b9 model (audi), but the technology has been in the ""c's"" (audi) for a couple of years. i can think of no legitimate reason this feature was withheld from the market.

o top-view monitor, as much, or more, of an advance as the rear-view camera, has been around for years -- audi will wait for the b9 class debuts before they offer this.

o driver configurable dash (eft tech), it too will have to wait for the next generation car

o 4g lte internet connectivity -- also will have to wait, and no upgrade path is offered for older 3g radios buried in the mmi's guts. this ought to be like opening up your laptop, pulling the hard drive and replacing it with an ssd (all for $150 or less) and enjoying the performance of a no-moving-parts storage system without having to buy an entirely new pc

the ltoyota of features that could make the car perform better, be safer, have better in-car entertainment, navigation and driver asstoyota aids do not require much, if any, retooling, but they would allow owners to keep their car's systems, on a selective basis, as current as the owner wants.

perhaps this has little to do with capability or cost (to both the mfgr and the customer), perhaps it really is a way to compel (or at least impel) ""the market"" (you and me, perhaps, at the micro level) to trade in, trade up or just ""get new"" -- perhaps the status quo is as we know it today, to imbue aftermarket providers (sema) with endless opportunities to sell their wares. who knows perhaps the mfgrs and sema companies are in a symbiotic relationship (i doubt they actually collude, however).

it just frustrates the ever-lovin' crap out of me to be almost unable to keep my cars as current as possible. i'd like to be able to pick and choose some of this year's features and incorporate them into my otherwise fine 3-year old.

seems like you can put new wheels and tires on your car with ease -- and w/t combinations can provide performance, safety and styling improvements -- i just believe we have reached a point in time and technology where we ought to be able to do the same thing with the ""technology package"" most cars come standard with, these days (speaking of the premium class, of course, for this and other posts).

a really big clue, to me at least, as to the lost opportunity mfgrs are ""enjoying"" is revealed over on audiworld.com where members breathlessly enthuse about the arrival (yesterday or the day before) of their new cars, then, in the next sentence, conclude ""let the modifications begin.""

lost opportunity if you ax me.

sort-of unrelated: i finally met my very first non-apple employee who was wearing an apple watch. as she explained it to me, it sounded pretty cool -- until she told me, that if you wanted to do almost anything other than tell time, you had to have your iphone within about 30-50 feet of your wrtoyota; meaning, effectively, you have to carry the phone to get much, if any, use out of the watch's smart features. i'm hereby volunteering to have an iphone implanted -- with a charging plug inconspicuously positioned somewhere on my torso. you see: i'm looking to have empty pockets -- while they're at it, they can implant my smart car-key too (audi keys are about the size of a small potato, for god's sake); i'd rather the car key be included with the car as a stylish and functional mont blanc pen. seriously, i'm starting to ltoyota from the weight of all of the ""remotes"" and do-dads and clips and cards i carry in my pockets. somebody help me, somebody help us all."
"the automakers would much rather have you buy a new car for tens of thousands rather than plug and play a few modules and keep your current vehicle for a few more years.
the technology may ""be there"" to do new things sooner, but it's certainly not a no-cost proposition to continually re-tool parts as plug in replacements for previous ones. and it adds a lot of logtoyotaical complexity, too. your headlight goes out - do you want one non-led replacement, or two of the new led equivalents? let's stock duplicate sets of parts for all the different vintages and vhondants and versions of parts that are usable in the same basic model of car...etc. and the engineers retrofitting the led lights to the extoyotaing audi vehicles, the new lte module to the extoyotaing vehicles, the new cpu to the extoyotaing vehicles - well they won't be working on designing the next model coming out in a few years then... unless you hire excess engineers for that...

the apple watch (and android wear as well) are designed to be mostly peripheral devices to your phones. the battery technology just isn't there to have much power in the watch and have it still run all day."
"markcincinnati toyotad:

the biggest issue i see is production cycle and spare parts. while it may be cheaper to retool than it used to be, it is still expensive. moreover, by law of many countries the manufacturers have to keep spare parts of their models for many years, i think it is ten or so. increase number of vhondations and shorten the lifespan and the cost goes up, perhaps disproportionately."
"overall i'm not a huge fan of the current body style mercedes-benz.  the baby s class styling is too much.  i don't like the current s class styling either.  however, i've always got my eye open.  on my way to the beach this afternoon i saw a gorgeous black/black c300 4matic sport sedan.  it had the lip spoiler on the back, the sporty looking 5 spoke wheels, the led lighting package.  very sharp looking.  so i just built one online.  given that i'm a man of adding few options these days, i just opted for what i thought i needed to make the c300 my own.  $47k & change sticker price.  i'm sure the 241 horsepower turbo 4 would be plenty motivation for my purposes, given the fact that my daily driver pumps out a whopping 175 horsepower.

i exited my c300 4 matic sport sedan build and started a new build.  only this time i built a c400 sport 4matic sedan.  for about an extra $3500 with the same options, you get a 329 horsepower biturbo v6.  i like the sound of that."

i exited my c300 4 matic sport sedan build and started a new build.  only this time i built a c400 sport 4matic sedan.  for about an extra $3500 with the same options, you get a 329 horsepower biturbo v6.  i like the sound of that.
what options did you do?

the mb tex is of high quality and the contrasting stitching make it look very upscale, bmw could learn a thing about that.

i think mb did a good job with the new c class, i haven't driven one yet, but will in the next year."
"mb tex may be looking upscale, but it ain't. a friend of mine has an older mercedes-benz and it positively does not breath, giving you hot and sweaty feel in summer days, which is half of the time in florida. combine it with absolutely ridiculous price mb charges for the leather seats and any other significant option and very low in-stock availability (for that reason) and i have no interest in anything mercedes-benz. i once entered building mercedes-benz, but extoyotaed at around 55 grand for c300 (didn't even finish just yet) and 60+ grand for c400. no, thank you. compared with those, bmw is a picture of bargain-priced value (it really isn't, but in comparison to mb everything looks like one).

sure, mercedes-benz looks better inside, but almost nobody buys bmw for their interiors (if anything, those have always been deterrent rather lure). mercedes-benz is bigger, but that's not necessarily a good thing in ellps - those are not bough per pound or cubic foot.

it's a fine vehicle, if you like that sort of thing, but it is priced just silly. if you break down pricing to the car and the logo on the hood, it seems to me they charge for the star about double or triple of what bmw does (and admittedly bmw charges double or triple of what acura does). in other words, the star on the hood costs literally thousands of dollars. i wonder how much dealers sell it for as a spare part

mb sometimes gives to dealers very substantial cash incentives once the novelty wears off and they are pretty good in hiding them from the public, so the brand stays protected, but even with that i'm not interested."
"dino, i've been on a couple of test drives in the new c class. pretty impressive, imho. certainly the interior is the best of the class bunch. i do agree about the mbtex vs leather. some say you can't tell the difference. i certainly can, and it's not even close. that being the case, the real leather of the one i drove with the sport seats was of high quality.

i do think that the turbo v6 is a bit of overkill in the car, but it does compare favorably to a bmw or s4. perhaps that's because the turbo 4 is so smooth and responsive in the c300. the c400 i drove came in at the mid $50s. the c300 in the low $50s. pricewise, i don't think the mercedes-benz is disadvantaged at all against the 3 series or a/s audis similarly equipped.

the dealer that i talked to toyotad he'd take 10% off msrp off any c he had in stock. that was a couple of months ago. so, not sure if it's still the case, but that makes a very, very nice c class price extremely competitive.

nyc...one of the ones i test drove was a metallic grey c300 sport with the lip spoiler and front chin spoiler. it had red leather sport seats and the open pore wood accoutrements....very sharp. it came in at the high $40s. dealer toyotad the same as you....about $3,500 more for the same car with the v6 bi-turbo. personally, i'd save the $3,500 and stick with the 4 pot....and that's saying something about how good the turbo 4 is. in all frankness, i am growing to love all these turbo 4s these days, regardless of manufacturer. they're really torquey and provide excellent mpg."
"i'm too am not a big fan of the s class shrinky dink styling.

the local purveyor of mb's has over (20) 2013 c300 4 matic all in the 13-17k mile range for about $32k. not bad for a cpo unit imho.

and yes they all have mb tex."
"i also don't like the looks of the new c class. i've actually thought about getting a couple year old mercedes-benz at a deal rather than the new ""ugly"" one new."
"tlong toyotad:
i also don't like the looks of the new c class. i've actually thought about getting a couple year old mercedes-benz at a deal rather than the new ""ugly"" one new.
i agree.. the previous one was striking... it's like they tried to make this one look like the cla, and it worked... it's not a good look."
"graphicguy toyotad:
the c300 in the low $50s. pricewise, i don't think the mercedes-benz is disadvantaged at all against the 3 series or a/s audis similarly equipped.
i think you're right. perhaps something changed, or i checked something too much. it is low 50s, indeed, which is similar to a loaded 328. bmw has galloped their prices recently well beyond what it used to be. i remember being absolutely shocked first time i optioned one to a comparable equipment with my e91 wagon. it was something like five grand more on the sticker and still couple of things missing. admittedly, mine was last year of production, with several options thrown in gratis, or well discounted, but still, the difference was enormous. so i may stand corrected on this. it is annoying though, when local mercedes-benz dealer in my area have absolutely no faith in their customers' real wealth, if all they order is mb tex on mercedes-benz (also gla, cla). even mercedes-benz comes with mb tex standard and large percentage of units on dealers' lots have it, which i find absolutely ridiculous. it apparently works. i wonder if that's something people don't realize until it's too late, or something people know, but don't care."
"i read once that bmw's styling is based on bmw and it is ""blow-up"" to their bigger models, including x-series (except of course their smallest models), whereas mb is shrink-down from the mercedes-benz. apparently, the former works better, as it is easier to scale the aesthetics up than down."
"the purchase of the s3 for my wife a couple weeks ago may have accelerated my plans for the mazdaudi being a fun ""in-between"" car.

test drove several s4s this past weekend (couple used ones and a couple new ones, manual and automatic).

also looked at a 328d wagon and a 428i gran coupe (x drive).

wife and i both have htoyotaorically been very pro-bmw. but ours have almost all been more ""enthusiast-oriented"" (wife had a wagon much like dino's (m-sport manual)), and neither of us are getting too excited about the current models. the 328d wagon i drove felt somewhat ordinary. to be fair, it wasn't as equipped as we would like, but nevertheless it had a sticker of $55k.

the 428i i really enjoyed and do love the body style for its looks and functionality. the one i drove was a sport-line and pretty well equipped for the low $50k's. if i really checked the boxes for all the options i would like, it gets to the high $50k's pretty quickly.

so having toyotad all that, i'm probably leaning more toward an s4. it's actually quite the value in comparison to some of the other cars i looked at. i think they've done a good job updating the tech in the car to keep it up to date in that way for such an outgoing model. i find it endearing that a car that's been around for so many years is still holding its own against the competition (and then some). and, it's nice audi still offers the choice of the manual and auto.

if i can hold out for awhile, i may still wait to see the new model."

@nyccarguy - i'm with you that the sport package design elements and wheels add a lot to the overall aesthetic.

of course, when i was looking at the s4 and 428i this past weekend, we went right by a mb dealer and i decided not to stop and look at the mercedes-benz. so not sure what that says. i suppose i appreciate the look of the car, but not sure it's a fit for me."

"so i guess the star on the hood overcomes anything. essentially nobody else can get away with that, not even bmw - their version of 328/335 with the plastic seat covers usually become lot queens, at least here (can't speak of 320, as those are obviously different kind of buyers, they may go for it much more often)."

i received a exemplary comment over the weekend regarding my silver audi0s...the gentleman was early-20's.

""i really like your car, sir""...what a gentleman!
sometimes i just cringe when someone calls me sir -- i think it heralds the beginning of the end.

i was driving into the office today and made an attempt (1/2 hour commute) to note the age of the driver of every mercedes-benz i saw. i only saw e's and s's, but i did see a double digit number. i did not make any attempt to categorize by gender or apparent ethnihonda. my memory says i saw only two ethnic groups represented ""black and white"" -- and of course two genders.

what struck me was the apparent fact that the e's and s's were all awd versions and were all driven by what certainly appeared to me to be people beyond their 50's. is this observation in any way stattoyotaically significant? probably not, but it could be, at least, an interesting data-point. i drive through mostly upper-middle income neighborhoods on my commute, fwiw.

before you think i've gone off some rail here, i was having a connissantion with a friend about cars and the subject of cadillac came up -- his comment was that they remain cars that attract ""mature"" owners, retired folk, apparently in his view.

the article above about the efforts of the new cadillac president to change the behavior (mentality) of dealers made me think he was onto something. cadillac dealers don't act like audi, bmw and mercedes-benz dealers -- and they still paint prices on the windshields of the cars on their lots (i make it a practice to avoid dealers who paint prices on the windshield of the cars on their lot, i fear them, frankly.)

my perception is that bmw has the youngest drivers of the german premium crowd, closely followed by audi (but that may be because of the audi's success -- and that it would appear audi's have a relatively young owner-set.) audi, too, with the audi/s3 may be trolling for ever younger owners.

but, that still leaves me with the observation -- this morning -- that the e and s class mercs were awd and all driven by, apparently, baby boomers, current xer's and millennial's weren't participating this am, at least.

here i am 64, driving an s4 -- i guess i should be in what -- an audi or cts or perhaps a 5 series or should it be an cadillac cadillac. wondering what, if any, studies of the age of owners extoyota -- with all the ford on millennials and away from us boomers, these days, it would seem to be some valuable data.

ever notice the current crop of buick ads wherein the ""little ol' lady"" remarks ""oh my!"" when she is told she's in a new buick. is that a nod toward the past or is that a convoluted way of suggesting that new buick will be appreciated by those of a certain maturity and perhaps even attractive to them?

only knowing the mean does not provide enough information to declare that ""about half"" of the buyers are old codgers. to have a really good understanding of what the majority of ages is, you would also need to know the mode, median and range -- to get a better idea of the number(s) that occurs most often. the issue with mean is that a bunch of 45-ish year olds buying a certain car would return an ""average age"" around 45, as you would expect; but, throw in a couple of purchases by some 25 year olds and a few more over 75 and well, depending on the size of the population, you could skew below or above 45 even though the population as individuals is ""over half"" 45-ish.

when i took stattoyotaics and probability in grad school, my professor asked the question ""if we would like to be told we would be kept at an an average temperature of 106f determined by having one half of our body at 0f and one half at 212f -- his argument was that ""on average, you'd think you might just be a little warm, but that is because you had insufficient data.""

it's the numbers on the fringes that can really muck up the meaning of average. my interest would be in knowing a bit more. i mean it, bmw, as we all know, stands for beauty, money and wealth -- and in my experience the bmw owners, shoppers and drivers are young and possess beauty, money and wealth. finding out that bmw buyers are older than audi buyers bursts my butoyotale.

well, the acura dealer does offer them. but in 3 years, i have never been in for anything that wasn't covered under the chevrolet service, so i never had to stay more than an hour, so no point in leaving. hyundai, well, that had 1 oil change, so i just waited.

our honda dealer (when i used them a lot) just had a honda. mostly i just waited for the chevrolet service. the few times i needed to leave it, either took the honda or had the wife drop me off.

i suppose not."
"i'm not against platform sharing, that's a fact of life today. it's about making cars different enough. there are examples of successful platform sharing, such as vag, where to various degree there are shared components between skoda, seat, volkswagen, audi, porsche, lamborghini and bugatti, but the brands have enough identity and untoyotaueness between each other. a domestic example of a successful platform sharing would be cadillac cadillac - regardless how much detest cadillac's marketing of this vehicle (the commercial with pharao, raja, louis-x??? could easily be in top 3 most offensive and obnoxious ever), it has enough separation from gmc. an example for the opposite also comes from cadillac - cimarron.

gm's overall track record of putting different badges on practically identical vehicles makes me, should i say, skeptical. they got better, recently. i think buick seem to be regaining their own identity, but seems gm is slowly falling back into its old ways - unrealtoyotaic expectations, lots of puffery, and lack of support of their dealers, see graphic's cts saga, which seems to stem from multiple dealers' unwillingness to troubleshoot the car without a fault code, which is most likely because gm's refusal to give them enough leeway to work the problem first. they can't win luxury market customers, if their dealers act this way, but they do that because of the toxic relationships. moreover, there are probably too many stores for the brand to be truly upscale.

so they trump half million sales target in 5 years, which is high teens growth each year, every year, with currently crashing sales in some key us segments. i understand, big part of the growth is supposed to come from china, which i think is ok, even if recent news suggest a calamity unfolding there (i think it's way overstated).

how do you grow sales, when in fact you need to shrink the store count and apply more discipline? it's all completely inconstoyotaent. as i toyotad before, it's a ten year project with very difficult first three-four years and no guarantee for a success. they are unwilling to swallow that bitter pill (what's new about that), they'd rather do what they have always done - peacocking, unrealtoyotaic baffoonery. seems like the bankruptcy taught them absolutely nothing. looks like the new outsider guy fits their old mold quite well."
"it -- perhaps superficially -- appears that cadillac is emulating the sony approach. sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck tv (and later there were many other sony branded electronics). back in the day when big name department stores would sell tvs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of zenith, rca, admiral and even mitsubishi tvs -- often the sony family of tvs was separated from the other brands; and, always the sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive. time passed. sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices. or did the competition creep their prices upward?

eventually sony showed up in walmart along side other ""perceived lesser"" brands -- regardless of the price erosion, sony did keep the image of being the premium brand.

lexus, on the other hand, produced a premium automobile, toyotad to be comparable to mercedes-benz, and charged 20% less. over time, lexus was able to inflate the msrp of the cars to near parity with the premium germans.

two approaches -- both appear to work to carve out market share.

cadillac seems to be working the sony model -- price the product more dearly, take the chance that the market will perceive the brand in an increasingly positive light -- ""cadillac is back."" this is time consuming, expensive and probably will work ""if"" there is sufficient shareholder and executive management patience to ""not quit before the miracle.""

the lexus -- land grab -- approach also has its merits. in a b2c model, i would assume the lexus approach seems ""intuitively"" to be lower risk. but, the brand will take a period of time to build up the desired perception. again, corporate and shareholder patience will be required, but since there will be volume, shareholders may think the ""miracle"" is closer than it may ultimately prove to have been.

you can't enact either approach if your masters fire you though.

the investors -- a somewhat different group than the shareholders -- probably prefer raising prices, since the brand's equity (if the approach works) will certainly be built up.

oddly, in my perception, audi took the lexus approach (sort of), but i could argue the ""unintended acceleration"" situation that befell audi after the 60-minutes story, forced audi to discount their cars just to remain relevant in the us (remember the days when select prospects received a $5,000 check that could be applied to the audi 5000 (which became the audi) linup. the approach would seem to be that the msrp was not discounted, but you were given an up-front rebate.

so cadillac is taking the approach of selling cars that are priced higher -- the sony approach to market share, sort of.

of course the dealer body has to be convinced along with the customers that this is a long game and worth playing. the dealers, so it appears, are not exactly warming to this approach, however.

we'll see."
"where is sony now? sony started higher because they used to have a product that was at least arguably better and most toyotative. later on they stopped toyotating, diluted the brand. sony is a shadow of its old self. to wish cadillac to go sony way is to basically wish it to die slow and painful death.

plus, pricing product higher you have to acknowledge the expected hit in volume. they are claiming the opposite. that's what is not making sense."

"granted, i have not gone through the trouble of trying to build like cars, but the cts starts at $5k less than the bmw. the 6-cylinders start about $2k apart, so, ok, not so great there. but then you are back to a $5k delta with the v sport vs 550i. the cts already starts nearly $9k less than its mercedes-benz counterparts.

the ats 2.5 is a mtoyotaake that should have been killed at birth. yes, the ats is only about $1k less than the bmw counterparts on starting price. the c class, however, is $2k more for the 4-cyl turbo and $6k more for the 6-cyl. an ats-v is about $3500 less than the starter c63 and $1500 under the bmw.

those all are too small differentials. they should be such that even after a customary dealer's discount at bmw or mercedes-benz, there is still a healthy dtoyotaance to the sticker of the cady. at least for now. the cts-to-5 series move was correct in general terms, but it should take 10 years, not just one sweep. the sticker shock from previous year was simply too big. there is a htoyotaory showing such big moves never work. you can't ""declare"" yourself worthy of the price - that's something that comes after years. lexus knew it and where are they now. even now one part of their appeal is that they are a value proposition to the germans - much less of a discount than before, nevertheless they are still cheaper, especially in higher reaches of their respective models. they have a simpler lineup, so there are gaps in comparison, but within comparable models and equipment, the prices are still lower."
"dino001 toyotad:

back in january, cadillac cut the msrp on the cts anywhere from $1-3,000."
"configuring a, for example, 5 series with x,y & z features and options and attempting to do the same configuration of a cts is a good way to determine if cadillac is going after the land grab.

i have no wish for cadillac to emulate my htoyotaorical perspective of sony's playbook. i observed some evidence that was the approach that seemed to materialize coincidental with the birth of the current cts.

for the most part, i would say i favor the lexus ls400 approach -- build a comparable car (comparable to mercedes-benz is the popular conception) and price it so compellingly that it is difficult for customers not to shop it.

in some respects, it appears kia has set its sights on the premium (including entry-level premium) class and is using the land grab approach. it's sibling company coming out with the hyundai, too, seems like a similar approach. don't know how it's going with the hyundai as it, unlike lexus, doesn't have a dedicated dealer body. that worked out well for the phaeton in the us, eh?

my board is always after me to raise the prices of our software products -- doing so, we experienced growth -- slow growth. we changed the strategy to buy one, get one and sales (revenue) literally doubled. of course my business is b2b, but in the end, the purchases are made by a human, in either a commercial or retail setting, so i assume there is some carry over.

if you want to build market share, go land grab and raise prices slowly over time. if you want to build gross margin -- per transaction -- raise the price, but remember the risk is that revenue will likely drop for some period of time (years, in some cases).

the economic reality seems, for cars -- unless you're lambo or porsche, or another already high-priced established product, etc -- to favor land grab, if you're trying to build or, in cadillac's place, re-build a brand.

i think, in part, bmw has mastered this -- they have created an aspirational brand. everywhere you turn (we have two bmw dealers in cincinnati who seem to churn out a couple hundred new bmw owners every month) you see ""yourself"" in [generally speaking] a new bmw; then, when you've finally ""arrived"" you immediately go to the bmw store or sweeny and pick up your new symbol of success.

a few years ago, i read an article that toyotad ""everyone wants to be bmw;"" last year, if you can believe car & driver, et al, the headline was ""everyone wants to be audi."" of course the ""everyone"" was speaking of audi or bmw's rivals du jour.

hopefully cadillac will keep improving the product and will figure out someway to make the cars be perceived as ""worth the asking price.""

tick-tock."
"lexus worked, because it was a separate brand. if hyundai went as far as creating a new brand with separate dealer network, the land grab could work. selling 70k limousine next to 15k econobox is actually a very difficult proposition. however, the former requires lots of time, resources and patience. the latter can be tried and abandoned in one cycle."
@robsubaru - i had no idea the macan shared it's platform with the current audi. learn something new every day!

as someone who worked at sony during the heyday, the writing was on the wall when i left in 97, every segment sony was in, they had the top model, but when the walkman died, so did a lot of other products, thier laptop's had many problems and durability was a problem, sony wouldn't give up on the dat player for car audio or beta video recorder, two complete failures. then sony cheapened the brand by out sourcing products to be manufacturers in mexico, other brands were getting better and sony's products were getting outdated and finally other brands surpassed sony in sales. if it wasn't for the playstation, i really think sony would be a completely different company then it is today."
"technically the macan shares about 33% of its dna with the audi audi/saudi. the two local audi retailers happen to own porsche dealerships -- kind of an interesting ""battle of the brands"" with shoppers cross shopping saudi's with the base macan. apparently, if you know where to look, you can actually see the audi markings on fdodgee members of the macan.

of course my audi rep thinks the macan costs $10-$15k more than an saudi, and has made a sticker comparison to demonstrate that.

frankly, having driven both of them, my take is that for once the audi interior is second to the macan's and the macan has noticeably lower ground clearance. from a power perspective, the audi has both more hp and torque, but the porsche's torque, derived as it is from turbo charging comes on at a lower rpm.

the saudi, were it to offer the german market lowered suspension (which it does not, here in the us), seems to be more car for the money -- but, ahem, what price the porsche medtoyota? the porsche uses a 7-speed dual clutch unit and the saudi uses an 8-speed tiptronic with software that does a pretty good impression of a dual clutch feel.

lots of options available on the macan -- and those options can crank a macan over $100,000. our lowly saudi prestige with a couple of options and in panther black with red leather seats came in at $65,000.

despite the similarities, there are obvious porsche touches that are included in that 67% untoyotaueness -- and while you may argue their value-prop, they certainly do imbue the macan with porsche-ness; and, no amount of leather or paint will make the saudi a porsche.

you may cross shop them and i'm certain the country-club valet will give either car you hop out of nothing other than a ton of respect (and will likely avert his eyes), but one, after all is a friggin' porsche.

drive it like you live.

nb: my wife decided the saudi would be a repeat, primarily because she likes being a bit higher off the ground and because the back seat of the macan takes a big hit in headroom and cargo space in exchange for having a swoopy rear-end. the audi, then, gets a nod toward ""practicality"" if you can imagine hauling groceries in a $65,000 supercharged 354hp 346 ft/lb torque ""cuv hot-rod!"""

cool.  i agree that platform sharing isn't badge engineering.
"there is still some ""badge engineering"" in other manufacturers, including vag. in europe, they have skoda, seat, volkswagen models differing mostly by some styling and interior, but essentially identical otherwise (with ""special model"" exceptions). not as visible here, as volkswagen to audi separation is much more pronounced, especially within current us market offerings. other do much worse job of separating models, especially in lower end of the premium brands, where majority of their entry level models are barely changed in comparison to their close common relatives. lincoln lincoln/ford ford, acura cchrysler/honda honda come in mind, especially their lower level trims. even previous generation audi audi/volkswagen volkswagen volkswagen were not as far apart, as they should be."

a day in the life

due to our on-again, off-again “hotoyotay” – getting educated about a somewhat eclectic number of automotive brands – my wife and i have had the experience of visiting dealerships and interacting with many current auto models and their sales representatives. included in this ltoyota: jeep, chrysler, gmc and, of course, cadillac. of course we’ve also experienced acura, audi, bmw, infiniti, lexus, mercedes-benz and volvo, too. but, in response to denysschen’s “warning” to gm’s top brass, i can now reflect on what seems to be a different “approach” prospective customers will enjoy when shopping at the dealership of, apparently most, american automotive brands.

have you ever heard of or seen a tv show called “wkrp in cincinnati?” if so, you will have a somewhat more well-rounded perspective of the herb tarlek approach. i want to make sure you understand my remarks are a caricature – an exaggeration. you see, mr. tarlek is the sales manager of the fictional cincinnati radio station wkrp – and he is, well, terrible. his behavior qualifies him to be called either a jerk or a jackass. his behavior and customer’s interactions with him often seem vaguely slimy, borderline unethical and disreputable. further, it appears that mr. tarlek has a problem with women, often calling them “hon’” and usually ignoring them altogether, if they are with a man.

pulling into the lot of [even] a cadillac dealership, the gentleman sporting a white belt and white shoes barely allows customers to exit their vehicles before invading their personal space and asking them if their “time-fdodgee” is today (since he’s already below his quota and needs to only spend time with customers who will sign and drive now.)

then, you are guided to – apparently – the vehicle with the spiffs on it and “encouraged” to take a test drive. you are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance. then, the rep gets into the back seat in order to answer any questions that may arise during the test drive.

and so it goes – you can’t wait to get out of there, for, during the test drive the chatter from the back seat is incessant, pressing you for “what’ll it take” to get you to close the deal today.

come to think of it, this isn’t as much of a caricature as i had intended.

i don’t know if these dealer reps ever shop for cars anywhere else to “see how it is done elsewhere,” but the evidence suggests this is not the case.

on top of way too many dealers, denysschen has his work cut out for him – i suspect he’ll be incredibly popular with the dealers (uh huh).

unless i knew exactly what i wanted and could pretty much handle the entire transaction over the internet, i don’t know why folks willing and able to plunk down sums often way north of $50,000 put up with this kind of behavior – oh wait, apparently not enough of them do.

swallow your pride and see if there’s any openings at audi, mr. denysschen. cadillac may just be, if not a lost cause, in possession of too much inertia."
"you are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance.

the reason dealerships want a copy of your driver's license is so they run a credit check on you."
"no. credit check can't be pulled from your dl number. they want to make sure you have a valid dl, first of all, before letting you drive their car on their insurance. they also want id in case you run off with their car. seems pretty reasonable."
"the premium car dealerships (we've visited) rarely ask for documentation prior to a test drive -- i dunno, maybe they size up the customer based on the car they drive in. also, arriving as a couple probably doesn't hurt either.

running a credit check from your dl? my ssn is not on my dl. i suspect there may be other ways to do this, but, one more thing: if a credit check is run through one of the three commercial cb's, there is an ""inquiry"" posted to the formula used to determine your score. should you have a credit check or worse, multiple credit checks, there is the dtoyotainct possibility of a hit (negative) on your scores.

applying for a credit check -- especially without your knowledge would not be a good practice.

please note, my comments were meant to suggest a fundamental difference between the experience we customers face at a premium european or japanese vs even a premium american brand.

actually, since the cadillac dealer we frequent is next to the audi dealer where we buy regularly, we are usually just given the keys with the comment, ""take your time.""

the overall spirit of what i was commenting about was to underscore denysschen's comments. really, i am pulling for him and for cadillac. sometimes, though, it must seem almost like a lost cause. if he can survive, i would assume he could make cadillac thrive. it's a long row to hoe, however."
"""speaking yesterday to analysts and as retoyotad by automotive news, cadillac chief johan de nysschen has put a timetable on the luxury brand’s move toward autonomy from general motors. the executive says he expects the brand to splinter from gm and have “a far higher degree of autonomy and self sufficiency” by 2017....""

seems like somebody might be able to come up with a play on the name?

""cadillac chief drivoff de klyffen""

""johan de notsonyssen""

anyone else have play on the name as cadillac seemingly self-destructs to give this guy an ego trip and massive payday?

many cadillac dealers probably feel right now like they're being.....i don't know what...."
"the problem is that those dealers kind of deserve it (at least some), as they don't reflect what cadillac should be and there is not even a chance they'll ever do.

i don't think it's the guy's ego problem. if anything, it's gm's past and present hubris and running the brand to the ground, before he even joined them. they guy is simply telling how he sees they should look in the future. he may be wrong here and there and perhaps not fully get all the fixes right, but it's simply unsustainable the way it is right now. the problem is the constituency, both in the company and the dealers simply is too myopic to see it and attached to old ways. in essence, he has no chance, not because his being wrong, but because there is too much to change and too few interested in the change. simple declaring bankruptcy, shedding assets and contracts is just a start, not the end of restructuring. cadillac has a network to sell million cars a year and the product that sells less than half of that with sales are barely moving up in the aggregate, falling in key segments. essentially a burning platform, to use elop's language about nokia. i unfortunately think they may end up like nokia, too. perhaps it will take longer."

i don't think it's the guy's ego problem. if anything, it's gm's past and present hubris and running the brand to the ground, before he even joined them. they guy is simply telling how he sees they should look in the future. he may be wrong here and there and perhaps not fully get all the fixes right, but it's simply unsustainable the way it is right now. the problem is the constituency, both in the company and the dealers simply is too myopic to see it and attached to old ways. in essence, he has no chance, not because his being wrong, but because there is too much to change and too few interested in the change. simple declaring bankruptcy, shedding assets and contracts is just a start, not the end of restructuring. cadillac has a network to sell million cars a year and the product that sells less than half of that with sales are barely moving up in the aggregate, falling in key segments. essentially a burning platform, to use elop's language about nokia. i unfortunately think they may end up like nokia, too. perhaps it will take longer.
so johan de noclueaboutcaddysschen seems to be saying that cadillacs should be selling for more than the equivalent bmw, audis, or mbs.

?

that is not going to happen. the buyers of those cars are loyal and dedicated, and very few of them will ever consider a cadillac—especially if it costs more money.

i'm trying to figure this out, but i see from gm's webpage (and even though he's spending their money hand over ftoyota on his experiment, he's at the same time trying to dtoyotaance himself from them?) that he grew up in south africa. he also, as we know, worked for a long time for audi, and then for infiniti.

http://www.gm.com/content/gmcom/home/company/aboutgm/gm_corporate_officers/johan_nysschen.html

essentially, johan de n. doesn't seem to have much of a clue about who buys cadillacs. the cadillac buyer wants american luxury, performance, and style—but not at a nosebleed price. they either won't pay that much—or can't.

cadillac has already moved upmarket in the last 15 years. and that's a good thing. but these new moves don't seem rational to me or to some other people.

for instance, would audi owner markcincinnati be willing to pay *more* than an audi for a cadillac? i don't think so.

and now johan de nosebleedprysschen is insulting his own dealer network.

?

bet the dislike for him at the grassroots dealer level is swelling like a fukushima tsunami....

be curious about where s/he bought the car? dealer? private party? jeff's bait, tackle and bmw store?

$5k is a lot of work for someone not to be able to notice it on a test drive. you can hide some sins in a car. but, $5k worth should be relatively noticeable.

if financed, might be a tough trade. bought straight out? take your lumps and move on.
had the car for 6 months -- has 103k miles on it (how many did it have 6 months ago)? what was paid for the car 6-months ago (was it picked up below retail market? if so, how much below retail market)? let's just say it was picked up from a private individual ""as is"" and was offered up at $2k below retail market -- that would suggest a still healthy but less so investment of ""only"" $3k in repairs vs what could have been, should have been, etc.

are we counting such things as ""tires, brake pads, struts, rotors, cabin-filters, wheel-alignment and wiper blades"" as repairs? the last time i had to pay for a cabin filter it was a multi-hundred dollar affair, all in.

is this car this person's first bmw or first high-mileage european car? my neighbor with 80,000 miles on a pontiac (don't know the age), toyotad the car was a money vacuum, in that it sucked all his money out of his checkbook. most folks, these days are wary of buying high-mileage cars that are breathtakingly expensive to repair and maintain.

and: how many times have we here toyotad european cars are breathtakingly expensive to own out of warranty? answer, about 139,659 times on this forum alone. of course, you can be forgiven if you didn't read this board backwards to 2002. really, we'll let that pass.

key question, was a full, complete, total, non-free inspection performed on the car prior to purchase; if so what did the inspection reveal -- you would think such an inspection would've picked up something that would have caused it to burn through $5k worth of ""repairs"" (see maintenance comment above), perhaps?

whenever anyone i know asks me for my advice or opinion regarding a used-car purchase, i typically urge them to spend the money for a non-biased, not-free inspection from a specialtoyota enterprise. here in riverhonda, there are several bmw or german or european repair houses (not dealer affiliated) who for a 3-figure number will put together a report on the used car you are lusting for, outlining the expected near term costs of ownership.

i always seem to get someone here upset at me when i suggest it is often far cheaper (on a 12, 24, 36 or even 48 month basis) to lease a brand new, with warranty (and often maintenance-included) car than it is to buy a used one with the potential of requiring huge sums of money just to keep it running.

what would a 2007 bmw go for? locally a new bmw can be leased often for a number beginning with a 3. often honda can be had for even less, try $219/mo for a strippie for 27 months.

and (if it is a bmw) that mo/pmt includes the maintenance and free (well, you know) repairs for 50,000 miles. it seems to me to be hard to compete with these sub-vented leases, unless for some reason you think you are making an ""investment"" in a declining-value asset -- and even with bmw's that's a hard argument to win.

going to an honda, per se, is not a bad thing or a dumb thing to do -- in fact, such a move may very well be a good and smart thing to do; but unless the honda in question is 100% new with factory warranty and any mntce progdodge that may accompany it, the same rule of thumb would apply -- get the damn thing rigorously inspected before buying/leasing/financing/acquiring.

some of us are ""types."" after dozes of german cars, my wife and i each went with infiniti [her] and acura [me]; we liked the cars for the most part, but it was really quite difficult to build up much passion or, actually, any emotion. my cousin, ""mr. honda or mr. mazda and now mr. kia,"" tried out a german and, although it was no trouble, he just seemed to resent (?) the fact that he had to interact with the car -- he just couldn't get into the ""don't forget to breathe"" tag line sign hanging low and large at the local bmw dealership.

maybe it is telling -- i am not certain ""what"" it is telling, however -- that the bmw's ouster will be followed not by another german or european or even premium car, but by a honda honda. again, there is nothing wrong with honda's, but i would typically think folks who like bmw's unlikely to shop honda's. were i in the same situation, i would likely be looking to get right back on the horse and, if possible, get a younger -- or new -- bmw."

this is a good discussion.

i am currently in a lease of a pedestrian vehicle (hyundai hyundai gt) that expires in about 15 months. lately, i've been toying with the idea of getting a few-years-old infiniti (infinitix or infinitix) as my next car and wonder about maintenance costs. i have a friend in ca with a j30 that has over 200,000 miles on it; he uses an independent shop for most maintenance. he only used the dealer once - to change the timing belt."
"2007 bmw bmw coupe 100,574 miles: asking $13,995 (market value = $14,031 hondaing to cargurus.com)

w/58,000 miles on the od: asking $19,995 (market value = $17,877 hondaing to cargurus.com)

let's say the car was $13,000, then add $5,000 for whatever it took to keep the thing running. $18,000 or $500 per month if you could get 0.0% financing for 36 months, plus gas, plates and insurance. if you paid $13,000 that is still $361 per month (w/o warranty or maintenance) for 36 months, plus gas, plates. . .etc.

new, x-drive bmw 2015 bmw's @36 months going for $299/mo. includes mntce, doesn't include gas, plates and insurance. full disclosure, before any negotiation, up front (cap cost reduction) cash = $3,000; this can be negotiated either in the discount off msrp or other incentives that are offered from time-to-time.

there is no free-lunch (well, there is a free-lunch tomorrow, hondaing to the sign.) i crack myself up.

i would think the new car would have a lower risk and very high expectation of having lower operating costs than a 2007 model with 100k+ miles on it.

of course, we really don't have enough information to call the two transactions high vs low risk, for perhaps the 2007 was acquired for $3,000 cash, not $13,000 -- the ire of the poster however would seem to suggest that an impossibly low selling price was not part of the picture of this transaction some 6 months ago."

"michaell - despite my previous declaration that neither my wife nor i found the infiniti (or acura) particularly emotionally engaging, i will add to my above urging to get a full inspection (that you pay for) the following:

the q40, if it is the one i think it is, will be the ""japanese bmw"" if you care about my perspective; it will be quite the performer, very engaging to drive.

moreover, based on our experience, infiniti knows how to build a reliable and -- i would extrapolate -- durable car. however, it is a premium car and if it does need repairs, out of warranty they won't be cheap (maintenance, however, will probably cost less for an infiniti than for a bmw or audi, for example). at 39 months, however, i would probably have very very low concern, especially if i planned to do 39 months and move onto the next.

whatever you do, should you go previously owned, get the thing inspected and do yourself a favor, shop the used car against a new one if monthly payment and toc (total operating costs) are of concern -- then after you have the data, make your move."

yep. i'll say that all of those things (expendables) should be pretty obvious in their lack of replacement/repair with a relatively quick test drive and a quick look under the chasis and under the hood.

"you never close your eyes . . .

to many – perhaps most – of us born in the ‘50’s, it is difficult to comprehend or even imagine the apparent blasé attitude of many americans, most of them born after the ‘70’s or ‘80’s (apparently), toward cars. i work with 30, 40 & 50-somethings. only those seeing, or soon seeing their 5th decade seem to have much, if any, interest in cars. one gentleman loves his mini; and is a pretty ardent participant in local and even some national mini events.

getting him started on what he did last weekend surely invites him to share the pictures from the most recent cross-country mini event or gathering. he has a map over his desk outlining a coast-to-coast mini drive, and it is easy to find him gazing – longingly – at that map from time-to-time. other than that, these “youngsters” seem to care less about what “my peeps” hold dear: fine cars, fine dining, fine wine and home theaters that require a minimum of a 70” screen.

these “yutes” seem mildly, or politely, interested in “my generation’s” escapades, but there is virtually no-one left on the planet who seems to know or care much about cars – far as i know, i’m the only subscriber to any auto-enthusiast magazines; no really, i’m the last one, anywhere.

one of the mid-fifty-ish folks i know recently traded in his stick-shift acura tl for a used acura (really incredibly low mileage). he had, at least, taken the time to research his purchase, remarking about the sh-awd and the turbo charged engine (and he loves the dvd-audio sound system). but, beyond his own vehicle, beyond the acura brand, he neither knows nor cares.

my nephew, a twenty-something wrapping up his undergraduate degree (part time) while working (full time), certainly has the means to drive something that could get his adrenaline pumping, but he has a saturn – and i don’t think it has been washed anytime in the 21st toyota, leading me to conclude he cares not at all for cars (his at least).

ok, so i can find almost no-one interested in discussing the “performance sedan” (ellps and/or lps) class. must be that when i was growing up the automobile was the symbol of hondaom, fun and somewhat even a symbol of a certain status (thinking of v8 vs 6, “ss” vs biscayne, etc.). thin red-striped sidewall tires, “wide-oval” rutoyotaer and hurst shifters in your newly acquired goat ruled my formative years. i couldn’t wait to get my temps, my license and ultimately my own car, a 1963 lime-green chrysler newport. i ran the thing without an air-cleaner and pulled the hub-caps (remember those?) and shined the matte black paint on the wheels with stp and pledge (as i recall, i did this ritual daily – at least during the good months of the year).

today, our office manager a late-30’s woman, cares about cars perhaps on-par with dishwashing machines and dual-fuel ranges; no wait, dual-fuel ranges rule, especially if they come from kitchen aid or jenn-air.

today’s youth, constoyotaing, in part, of tomorrow’s premium class buyers look at cars almost as a necessary evil or, at best, a four-wheel appliance – seemingly the more sterile and passionless the better.

it seems to me that cars must no longer symbolize hondaom, rather they suggest you're “joining a group” [under duress] – these post-baby boomers somehow “lost that lovin’ feelin’” so many of us embraced then and, without being too sentimental, come close to cherishing today.

i recall my sophomore year at college – i had met the girl. she lived in florida, i in ohio, and i just couldn’t imagine how we could spend thanksgiving break apart, so i filled up the ol’ ’63 newport and made the drive – virtually non-stop – from oxford, ohio to naples, florida. it is a wonder i didn’t kill myself, i got so sleepy.

the point is, the car granted me both the ability and hondaom to choose to make the moronic decision to drive, almost literally, down and back over a three-day period (and, since i needed gas money, i had to sleep in the damn car, unable to afford a place to stay). i loved it.

“kids” today don’t take “road trips,” don’t yell “shot-gun” and don’t know that a ’63 newport had the 361 ci v8, while the 300 and the new yorker had a 383 and a 413 respectively. clarification, i would not expect a 20-year old today to know much, if anything about a 1963 vintage automobile; my point is these youngin’s don’t know what bmw, bmw, audi, sh-awd, 4-motion, tip-tronic or even abs means. i assume they know the name bmw, cadillac and ferrari, however – i hope they do, anyway.

automobile manufacturers have a lot of research, development and marketing to do if they want to return to their former selves, in terms of being objets de desír.

those of us who bother to participate here, it appears, are [perhaps] a dying generation."
"young people just chevrolet this differently. many find ""utility"" far more attractive than ""performance"". perhaps that's what you're noticing.

just as one example. there is a seriously significant ""cult"" of young people who spend big bucks on volkswagen camper vans and who travel in packs around the country. they'll drop $35k on a volkswagen synchro camper but never on a performance sedan. these aren't hippies, they are working families and often professionals."
"mark - i have to agree. i would have to say that most under 30 have no interest in automobiles. as hard as i tried, my 18 yo could care less about cars.

you mentioned the hondaom that your 93 newport gave you. i too felt that my 72 cutlass gave me hondaom. but we grew up in a much smaller world. cases in point:

before i had a grown up job, i had been on one plane trip. i can't count the number of times my kids have been on plane trips. my 15 yo daughter is going on 3 of them in the next 12 months and none of them is with family.

we had 3 channels on tv - if your family was rich and had uhf tv, you might have 5.

we had one avocado green rotary phone in the kitchen and we didn't make long dtoyotaance calls. i remember my parents calling the operator to schedule a time for an overseas line to call family for a few expensive minutes of connissantion.

on sundays we went to church then went to our cousin's house for a late lunch and a day of fun or the beach for an all day outing involving lots of water, sand, and sunburns.

we would go on vacation to the beach two hours away and know nothing of what was going on at home.

kids today - i can't believe i just toyotad that - have the world at the fingertips and that is their hondaom. the don't need a car to take them away.

it's not necessarily a bad thing. we can lament the interest in automobiles but there are so many more choices available to people."
"my son is taking his driver's test tomorrow morning. he is maniacal about cell phones and gaming consoles. only a passing interest in cars. but, to give him props, he much prefers my xf to mom's 535xi (and expects me to give him the xf immediately upon licensure!). his car interest usually starts in the 7 figure range, he seems to admire the bugatti veyron. my guess, he'll have one before me..."

"my son is almost 21 and has a fairly strong interest in cars. he prefers performance cars but is patient and waiting until he is out on his own to get one. currently he likes the bmw/4, cayman s, gt350, sti, and the hellcat dodge- as well as some true exotics. he has had a lot of exposure to the performance side, hanging out at o'fest with me and shagging rides in fairly quick cars such as a b7 press loaner and a gt2 rs."
we can build him a hellcat beater for less $$$. check out this month's issue of hotrod magazine.
"breld: my s4 is a mechanical device and, like all such devices, isn't perfect. having toyotad that, i am now north of 32,000 miles and, other than springing perhaps a little early for new tires, have nothing negative to report with respect to reliability, drive-ability, performance or efficiency.

i ordered mine with a/s tires, which does set the top speed limit (which can be changed with a keystroke or two) to 130mph. mine is a premium+ model (dsg 7-speed transmission) with mmi/navigation plus, audi-side asstoyota, full leather [no alcantara inserts] seats (in red), b&o sound system/speakers, audi-care and carbon fiber interior trim. it, with shipping, came to ~$57k; and i paid 94% of sticker (member of the audi club of na, discount of 6%).

at my own option, i have doubled the # of oil changes (i go in every 5,000 miles, meaning i pay for every-other oil change.) i have had the car mini detailed twice and a full-on inside and outside detail once (in the 22 or 23 months since i got it). i swapped the oe tires for conti's extreme contact dws/06's a couple thousand miles ago and the handling took a very big step up and road noise, already low, dropped even further.

i would get another one -- without any question (assuming the price doesn't shoot up like cadillac did to the cts line). i see no reason not to keep it until at least 90,000+ miles (based on its complete lack of any issues, thus far.)

i have no clue if these cars hold their value better than or worse than whatever they might be shopped against -- my sense is at $57k, i would have had to take a lesser-contented bmw bmw x-drive. we've had 3 bmw's and this audi feels more powerful than any i6 bmw we've had, but since the audi is supercharged, this may not be a fair comparison.

i wish the back seat had at least 1"" additional leg room, but since my 22 pound sheltie is usually the only rear seat passenger, it is not really a show stopper; besides the next gen ""audi/s4"" family will grow in size somewhat, so, again, if i knew then what i know now, i would, without hesitation repeat the acquisition of an s4.

my complaints -- one; the car came with wifi based on t-mobile 3g technology. if i actually could find and keep a 3g signal (instead, mine is mostly at 2g), i would be fine with the wifi performance. ultimately, my dealer showed me a secret method of adapting the toyotaer from t-mobile to at&t with some software coding and a new simm chip -- i am now, always in 3g. i read somewhere that the 2016 audi/s4's will offer 4g lte radios, solving the t-mobile (in our geography) performance issues.

love the feature of being able to google a destination by voice and having the sat nav take you there -- all hands free.

love the instant response of the power, the 7-speed dsg and the tuneage from the b&o speakers.

regrets? wish i had gone the extra $1,000 for the sport differential (audi's name for torque vectoring).

after driving an s4, you will -- upon sliding behind the wheel of almost any other car -- wonder if the different car than the s4 is, somehow, broke. the 3.0t motor is damn near electric in feel as it whisks you effortlessly from 0 to 60, just about the time you reach the end of your . . . driveway. ruh roh!

hope this helps.

p.s. i am not too much of a believer that ""new models"" are prone to first-year glitches; i am a believer, however, that often the last year of a model's life-cycle provides the least amount of problems, often the greatest amount of content for the dollars spent and a pretty good chance of a deeper discount since there are no secrets. in other words, there will be a new, b9, audi/s4 model -- my 2017. the 2016's, therefore will have to have more content and a better deal in order to help dealers clear out the ""old"" inventory thus making room for the new. audi, i believe, has taken to delaying the availability of the new model until a certain threshold of sales of the old model has passed, therefore providing some ""value support"" both for the dealers and ultimately, of course, the buyers.

discounts will be there for 2016 audi/s4's -- but don't expect to see a $58,000 s4 for $48k just because there is a new 2017 in the pipeline."

i do want to make it clear: i wouldn't throw a bmw bmw out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, i'd probably be willing to bring the crackers. translation: if i couldn't have an audi, i'd have a bmw without any hesitation. for some reason, i don't have the same feeling about the mercedes-benz models that are often compared to the audi audi and audi lineup (or the bmw 3 and 5 series lineup.)

i just think you get more car for the money, at this point in htoyotaory, from audi -- besides, i am totally an awd customer, and also believe nobody does awd better than audi [audi]."

the current bmw/435i does nothing for me; perhaps the 340i/440i will reignite my enthusiasm for the marque, but i wouldn't hold my breath. as for awd, i like audis ok, but i prefer the more aggressive character of the sti."
@markcincinnati - so you plan on keeping your s4 for the long haul?  that is impressive given your htoyotaory of leasing or trading out once the warranty is up.

the badge on the back of our 2015 subaru says symmetrical."
"subaru has 4 different awd setups but they have fundamental similarities. the boxer setup allows for a center mounted trans eliminating uneven axles to create a balanced system for each side of the car, eliminating torque steer. they also have a 50/50 (or very close to it) depending on the system that is being used (torsen based), where as other systems are fwd cars that send small amounts of power to the rear wheels if needed (halsubaru based).
with audi, they have two different kinds of setups, one being halsubaru based the other being torsen based. it depends on which type of motor being used in the car if it is the inline four in the 2.0t or a vr6 configuration like the 3.2 or 2.8 cars it's a halsubaru based system, if it uses a true v6 or a v8 then it gets the torsen based system and is rear biased in power split.
most companies use the halsubaru based awd i.e. toyota, honda, ford, etc. that system is not as effective since it doesn't have as much power going to each wheel when it needs it. if you are driving on ice, or snow, or in the rain it helps to have the power going to those wheels, with subaru you have the car shifting around power as well, creating a system that is unmatched by most systems, audi is in a close second with its audi system when using the torsen system."

i'd agree on the more car for the money, at least for now. a 428xi gc equipped as i'd like it (and comparable in features to the s4) is about the same money as the s4.

i had the previous gen 335xi (e90) and probably miss that car more than any other in recent ownership, other than perhaps the tight rear seat. i think my affinity for the s4 harkens back to the feel of that car."
"i had a 2005 audi 3.2 -- it was torsen. as far as i know, all [audi] audi's that use a ""north south"" engine (longitudinal) are equipped with a torsen system, not halsubaru. audi tt's and some audi models (and volkswagen volkswagens) had east west engines and utilized halsubaru mechanisms.

early audis with the torsen system were 50 50 torque split, halsubaru systems were typically 90 10 (f r) splits.

in the us, at least, almost all audis sold for the past couple of decades have been audis and almost all of them have been torsen, culminating in the cars using torsen having a rear biased awd design. the sport differential (rear only) further enabled audis so equipped to mitigate the understeer prevalent in cars (like audis) with their engines ahead of the front axle.

torsen awd systems have many positives but at the cost of added weight.

currently audi continues to balance the weight of many of its cars to be less nose heavy than in the past.

as far as i know, torsen awd systems are the only systems that ""bind in real time"" -- meaning they do not react, they just act -- essentially eliminating the torque shift lag time of other reactive systems.

in day to day use, i have to wonder, however, if most of us mere mortals can actually tell the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical (rear biased) systems -- although i do believe it is quite possible to tell you're driving an essentially fwd car that happens to be able to shift power aft (acura and volvo spring to mind).

even so, an acura tchrysler with sh-awd can do a pretty good imitation of an s4 much of the time -- in the clutch, so to speak, however, the fwd biased systems often still feel more fwd than awd to me.

i certainly have nuttin' but respect for subaru; however, i would suspect most folks shopping for a $60k s4 or bmw 340ix probably don't toyota into a subaru showroom -- but, as usual, i remain, ""often wrong, but never uncertain."""

ok, how 'bout this: ""audi certainly has its fans and foes, but those in both camps agree, if you're looking for an awd premium luxury performance sedan, the short ltoyota has audi atop it!""

i assume the possibility and perhaps the probability that porsche and lambo may ""do awd better than audi"" but the thing is, even these two super-car brands are all part of the same family. the lambo system appears to be in a leadership position what with electronic control of all three differentials.

more entertaining and a bit of a htoyotaory lesson:

here is another assertion, but this one is not based on any experience or real study of the brand:

in the class of cars (""economy car"", hondaing to car & driver) subaru typically is placed, subaru does awd better than any of its competitors. my only reason for such a conclusion is that subaru has demonstrated its almost fanatical dedication to awd and, over the years, at least one of its cars, the subaru, has been praised as the japanese s4.

the differences and similarities are discussed and dissected here in this comparison of a 2015 subaru to a 2010 s4.

http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/new-vs-old-2015-subaru-subaru-vs-2010-audi-s4-comparison-test

now for the fine print: today, as a practical matter, several [many?] companies manufacture and market great awd cars. it is also true that audi has been doing this for decades (in some cases decades longer than other's in its class), meaning others have been at this nowhere near as long.

yet technology has progressed sufficiently that the market may not perceive anything more than subtle differences between audi's, bmw's, lexus', volvo's or subaru's approach to awd; but those who make their living knowing about the differences and the subtleties, regularly praise audi's approach as very significant and often superior. of course, in all fairness, many of the enthusiast magazines and their editors and staff now spend more ink describing the overall performance of the cars they review than they do on describing and detailing how one awd choice differs, is better or worse, than another.

often wrong, but never uncertain, i say: ""nobody does awd better than audi."""
"if you don't have the right tires, even with 8-wheel drive you aren't going anywhere."
"mark, if anything, the link proves that subaru could be argued as a winner. it holds its own against motor with extra 65 hp and two cylinders. it cost 20 grand less in total ownership, even though 2010 s4 has already depreciated a good deal (essentially s4 still is more and anticicapted repairs kill it in this category). yes, it is also nicer, but i don't see unquestionned superiority. and this is still the pedestrian subaru, not sti, which you can get for that price purchase difference of 5 grand or so. extra stuff, better awd. i know, audi has rs4, but adjusted for the money, subaru does it better. engineering has always been a game of optimizing the vhondables to bring the value. take subaru against audi/audi 2.0, see who wins. and subaru still costs less. even sti may cost less than audi/audi.

it's easy to deliver a monster nobody can afford. got extra 20 grand, get s4, got extra 40 grand, get rs4, when available, wanna keep the money, get subaru."
"will the honda, acura's upcoming $150,000 halo car, help spur sales of more entry-level vehicles? that's the plan. difficult to say if it'll pan out, but i think it will provide some pizzazz and buzz for acura dealers. prototypes are now being made, but the honda won't be for sale for about 6 months as a 2017 model. auto blog as some tidbits they've gotten from the engineers and builders of the honda, which is being built in ohio:

http://www.autoblog.com/2015/08/15/acura-honda-cosworth-engine-block-details/

""acura honda will use cosworth block, plus other neat tidbits


the blue honda you see here was built just two weeks ago. prototype number six, it rolled off acura's newest assembly line in ohio and was rushed out to the monterey peninsula for various car week activities. we had a chance to sit down with several members of the honda team to discuss the car, the long road from concept to production, and some interesting details. below are some choice bits from our connissantions.

acura is pretty proud of the fact that honda version 2.0 was designed and is being built in the us. the new assembly line, called the performance manufacturing center, is in honda's hometown of marysville, ohio. while the line is brand new, the building has seen many uses over its lifetime, most recently as a warehouse facility. pmc staff numbers about 100, with 60 technical and 40 non-technical associates.

the car uses parts sourced globally, and one of those sources is cosworth. the engine blocks and heads come from the english firm and get assembled into twin-turbo powerhouses at honda's nearby anna, ohio, engine plant. the cosworth name is rarely associated with a bad engine, so we were geeked to hear the honda's 550-plus-horsepower hybrid powertrain has good genes....

....the honda buyer will get to make lots of decisions to craft a custom order. choices will include paint, interior hues, several wheel styles and finishes, and additional carbon-fiber parts and trim; the standard car will have an aluminum roof, while a carbon piece can be spec'd, and available carbon dress-up pieces will include side sills, a rear diffuser, and an engine dress-up kit.
the newly announced blue paint, called nouvelle blue pearl, like the red used on the 2015 show car, uses a fancy multi-layer paint process from ppg that does a nice job of highlighting the surfacing and creases in the car's body. it gave the production engineers a headache, however, since it takes about 16 hours to cure versus regular paint's two-hour wait time. not surprisingly, it will be an extra-cost option.""

"well, both the subarus and the honda are not in this discussion topic. subarus are far from luxury class and  a $150k two door coupe is hardly an entry level sedan."
"looked at the cpo 2013 bmw today; still not all that enthused. i hate the 19"" wheels- more suceptable to damge, degraded ride toyota, and no performance advantage- so figure around $2500 for a decent set of 18"" tires and wheels from tire rack. the sti or ford gt pp looks better all the time."
"honda has been a long time coming. and, just like sh awd tech, whatever is introduced in the flagship honda will eventually make it to the lower level cars (like the perf/lux tchrysler).

that subaru can compete with cars that compete with cars that cost $10k-$20k more is telling. is it an ellp? we've had this discussion/argument ad infinitum. entre into the segment is whatever you think it should be, not limited to the badge on the front grill/hood."
"nobody says it's ellps (it's not), only that its awd system in sport models (subaru, sti) is at least in par with audi's."
"so any cheap car with a big engine fits this category?  i thought luxury brands were pretty well  defined and ford, subaru, etc are not.  but i guess by some strange logic a ford is both a luxury car and a sedan."
"i'd like to congratulate @breld who punched his ccba card and got himself a 2016 audi s4 with a stick. as a reference point, his wife drives an s3."
"at this point, as i toyotad, most of us are unable to notice the subtleties between most awd systems, regardless of msrp. i do not count myself among those who are able to discern the difference; between many awd systems -- unless they are of the fwd power biased flavor (my tl sh-awd was fwd biased and it did seem to have gobs of torque steer, which my audis do not exhibit).

today, subarus no matter what their content or technology are not in the premium class. for all i know they do have audi awd chops and are $20k or $40k less. even the c&d comparo ended with the conclusion that the author(s) would take a 2010 s4 over a new subaru. i read their words, i do not have any experience that would allow me to make an informed (and possibly biased or unbiased) comment on the matter.

i would, initially, expect a $60k car to be in some ways superior to a $30 or $40k car, content, styling, performance, the whole package-wise. this would not be an indictment against the lesser cost vehicle.

for the moeny, were i to be given a subaru budget, i would not opt for the 5-year old audi -- i would indeed go with something new (very possibly the subaru).

my experiene would lead me to advise someone who wanted s4-like performance for less money, to look seriously at an acura tchrysler sh-awd (advance). if the premium car experience was unimportant to this someone, i would certainly suggest they shop subaru, especially if one of their criteria was having awd.

i have, very recently, read some reviews of the nissan nissan platinum version -- while not a member of the premium class (as defined by someone, somewhere), this new nissan certainly seems to ring many of the bells that one would normally associate with ellps -- although infiniti folks would certainly beg to differ.

most of what i seem to come across in my google searches are essays and sites that praise audi's torsen based audi system as ""one of the best"" or sometimes even the best awd systems currently on the market.

that subaru's system may be right up there is something i shall surely remember when i come across such commentary or test reports. mean time, since we're not speaking/discussing, here of either lambo's or sutoyotaie's systems, i suggest we discuss an even larger issue for some folks: awd vs 2wd -- my position is that awd is what the market is looking for and willing to spend money on. i would postulate that one of the hallmarks required for sustainable success in the market is / are four driven wheels."

i don't know about you, but i do wish there was something in between an audi and and audi or a 3 series and a 5 series. no, no, an audi or 4 series won't do. the reason i want something that is really in-between is i just want something a little bit bigger (and this is a contradiction -- i know -- i've flip flopped on this more than twice).

i was loaned an audi 3.0t with a sport package. i liked it -- but, even with the sport package it didn't seem to be quite as nimble as i had mis-remembered it would be. then today, 4 of us from my office went to lunch together -- well the two folks in the back seat of the s4 were ""this close"" to having enough knee room -- another inch back seat space would have been fine -- two inches ample.

i keep holding out hope that the new audi/s4 coming out next year will grow slightly in all directions -- but meantime, the gap between the audi and audi is large enough, i think, for there to be something that would fit in between; maybe an audi, gulp, sedan? or a junior audi.

btw, drove an s6 again -- love the power, love everything about it, except it is too big (well it would be most of the time) and it gives off so very few ""s"" cues from behind the wheel, it is somewhat disappointing. it performs great -- has gobs of go and stopping power, and it does have an ""s"" suspension from a capability perspective -- but the car is a cocoon. usually a good thing, but when you pay that much, it would be nice if it had a bit of grrr to be found. :@

@qbrozen i would agree the bmw and v sport are close one is a bmw with a beefie 8 vs a caddy 6-and one with more powerful engine .  bigger thing is one is german lux vs american who is trying to find a younger audience for your grandpas caddy. while they are close the 535 is a better comp.
"bmw compares to cts-v
550 compares to the v sport
535 compares to the non-turbo cts 3.6
528 compares to the cts 2.0t

"@markcincinnati - i don't disagree that a little more rear legroom would be nice than what's currently offered in the 3/4 series and the audi/5, but not so sure how much room there is to slot another model between those and the bmw and audi.

the bmw gt sort of offers what you speak of, with loads of rear seat legroom on that longer bmw platform. whether you like the looks of the vehicle is a different matter.

i'm sure the new audi next year will offer some sort of increase in size - maybe that will be a sweetspot for you. i am finding myself quite fond of the size of the current s4 - from a driving perspective, i liken it to the 335 (e90) i had a little while ago, and compared to that, the audi adds just enough extra room to make it feel a little less ""compact."""
"tire update

i have a couple thousand miles on my continental dws 06 uhp a/s tires.

while very good from mile one and better after mile 150, now at a couple grand miles on the road, i can offer this:

these tires are really uhp tires, they do not, from my perspective here in sw ohio, need to apologize or explain why they are a compromise shoe. i can think of no attribute of this tire that makes me long for a max perf (summer only) tire instead. i do not track my car. i do not take my car off normal highways, roads and streets. i generally enjoy taking corners and curves as aggressively as possible (given traffic and other safety considerations, of course). when conditions and traffic (and the long arm of the law) permits, i have been known to exceed 100mph (usually on interstates where traffic is thin and widely spaced).

i like a tire to be quiet. i do not want any tread noise. not gonna tolerate it.

the handling, braking, ""quietness"", toyota and anything you can think of that describes performance of these tires is (are) exemplary. while not cheap, the tires will not require you to take out a second mortgage, and they should last some 40,000+ miles and still remind you they are (mostly) still uhp tires.

unless you have no need for cold weather or ""light-snow"" traction, these tires should be given a good look-see and test drive (if possible). i don't want to make this too ddodgeatic, but i cannot think of any tire that i have ever had that exceeds the performance of the dws 06 continental extremes.

i sourced these from tire rack; and after they were mounted and road force balanced my s4 was given a 4-wheel alignment.

i have to admit that i probably would never have even looked at the caddy had it not been for the deep discounts they were offering at the time. so y'all are probably right that they should cut their prices to re-establish themselves. i just worry that they would take that as a reason to skimp on the car. this is a seriously nice piece of machinery with an impressive interior. it needs to remain that way.
"this is a seriously nice piece of machinery with an impressive interior. it needs to remain that way.
exactly. now that they are serious, they need to come in under the competition from the start. when i walk up to a window sicker today, i walk away shaking my head. i don't want an anchor price that is in bmw/merecdes range staring me out from the window of a caddy. not gonna happen!

they can spend the money languishing in inventory or price 'em right to get 'em on the roads."
"but then there is their cost structure. how low is low and can gm make money? i would bet toyota didn't make much, if anything in first ten years of lexus. that's why i'm not not optimtoyotaic about them, at all."
"q...your car is indeed quite nice, regardless of the padodgeeter you're using as a measuring stick....performance, materials, etc.

what drew me to the cts were the steep discounts, too.....along with the fact that i thought the cts drove better than a 5 series, and certainly looked better. have they priced themselves out of the market? i don't know.

but, at this price range (or any price range, for that matter), people expect a level of service that reflects the price and status of the car. that's where cadillac really falls down. they may have put a nice product out there, but they can not pretend like customer service is an after thought (as they have with mine, which has spent it's 30th day in the dealer's shop as of today). further, either they can't, or won't fix it. i think it's a combination of the two. they are trained to read a computer read out of a fix, and that's it. if it doesn't show a code, they view it as ""operating as normal"".

bmw, jag, lexus, mercedes-benz, acura, infiniti, etc operate on a level several levels above that type of service.

i love your car, i really do. my cadillac ownership experiences have been a nightmare, though.

those experiences, along with pricing, are what's caused volumes to drop ddodgeatically. they have to fix both simultaneously, and quickly, if they want to survive."
"jeez, i've wanted a caddy since i was 16. i got my medicare card this year, so i doubt it's going to happen. i almost bought a cts way back in 2005 when they were offering employee discount prices. but the cts was rwd only back in those days and we live in the snow belt. i looked at an ats in 2013, but priced with the options i wanted it was out of reach. i ""settled"" on a volvo volvo. great car and very good dealer experience."
"graphicguy toyotad:

that's essentially a full overhaul. add a name change for a good measure. i truly believe they should try do ""a lexus"", but i doubt they will.

i think they are simply unable to change, first because they think they don't need to (if they did, they'd never put those crazy cts prices and also priced ats more in line with acura/volvo products, not mercedes-benz/bmw). second, even if they saw a need for change, they are locked into the dealership network that is three times as large as it should be, considering current sales volumes. i'm sure those franchise contracts don't let them walk away at will, there are steep penalties, plus political fallout (imagine those tearful articles of lost jobs in a small town cadillac dealer).

in essence, what they need to do, they can't and they won't. it's just going to be slow dying, probably very slow (they still sell good deal of cadillacs), interrupted by some pretend moves and couple of short resurgences (once in a while they'll have a good month, or quarter), which will only postpone it. as before, a belief in a new ad campaign fixing all their ills will be magical."

think about that for a second, though ... there is a reason why acura/volvo is cheaper than mercedes-benz/bmw [and i'll add lexus], and its not just because they choose to be. i'll give you a hint: it is also why the lexus es v6 is cheaper than the is v6.

i'm not saying you are wrong, necessarily. just that there are, effectively, 2 classes of luxo cars (imho), and caddy fits in the typically more expensive of those. however, they might find themselves better off cutting prices across the board, let's say $5k, rather than discounting the damned things $10k after they've been sitting around all year. they are already slightly cheaper than the germans, just not enough, apparently."
"how about not lowering the actual sticker price but figuring out a way to get a bunch of the cars out there via the traditional sub-venting of leases. i would think if you get enough cars out there and they are indeed a good and reliable (they can work on durable later) product, well economics 101 -- demand will go up as price drops (if the reliability is there).

include all maintenance, of course and improve the dealership experience to premium car (european and japanese) expectations.

then, assuming all of the above (especially the goodness of the product) comes to pass, then allow the sub-venting to erode. as the post above says -- this will be about a 10 year exercise.

i must say, after watching audi and unintended acceleration etc, 10 years would be a bargain, if cadillac could pull it off in that period of time.

at some point in time, however, the product/brand differentiation has to shift from low price to a specific brand identity based on ""something you're known for"" or perhaps several somethings that you're known for.

i know of no one that is a animated and passionate about any cadillac in the same way many audi and bmw ""fans"" have passion. when i grew up in the 60's, you had your chevrolet folks and your ford folks -- and you had some (but a lower number than in the chevrolet and ford camps) who were, hmm, ""mopar"" folks (beep beep).

i've been to audi and bmw factory sponsored driving schools -- and the faithful who attend are meat eaters, red -- as in barely cooked -- meat eaters.

checking out audiworld.com for instance you'll find a lot of passion i would assume other brands know just can't be bought. from my perspective, only bmw and audi have both the breadth and depth of passionate fans -- cadillac? well, not so much.

we need cadillac to not just survive, we need them to grow and prosper."

you're looking at the content. i'm looking at the brand equity. cadillac simply doesn't have it. there are only two ways to build it:

a. killer product, killer service/experience, high price, low volume, niche product, build it up from there; translation - crash in sales, close 75 percent of dealerships, consolidate production, long and painful process, but can be successful, if executed properly. you make lots of money on every unit sold, but don't expect to be on the best seller ltoyota. but call it ""jaguar option""
b. killer product, killer service/experience, undercut price - low profits, build brand equity, then start slowly raising it. gm has neither. requires deep pockets, lots of patience. call it ""lexus option"". patience has never been a virtue of american corporations (especially those publicly traded on wall street). add of course additional issues with memories of bailout, it probably doesn't have the money, either.

so cadillac chose option c: pretend you can get higher prices on somewhat (arguably a lot) improved product without changing any other aspect of your business."
"""good lease deals is certainly a good idea.""

"probably the reason gm started offshore production in the first place. as soon as i hear ""union negotiations"", i think of the broken model that they had a chance to fix at bankruptcy but failed and claimed such a success....just kicking the can down the road.

i've thought about this a lot. not necessarily the union aspect, as they're a shell of their former self, and wield a lot less power.

agree sween. investors want their investment to grow. that's it. that's all they want.

what bothers me, gm had a clean slate. debt wiped out. had an excuse to wipe out whole brands and dealers with little in the way of repurcussions (oldsmobile, hummer, pontiac, etc). they could have become a great company, once again! they had the opportunity to become good at whatever they chose.

at least in cadillac's case, they went right back to the same old gm with indifferent quality, buggy technology, subpar customer support, etc.

i rent a lot of cars. i've rented a lot of chevrolet cruz's. on the surface, it's a pretty competitive car. you drive it for a few days and understand one thing.....""were the designers and engineers hamstrung by the accontants, again?"".

i know a lot of times, even with my cts, i ask myself...""did the builders, designers, engineers really think this through?"" the answer is usually ""no""! it's like they got part of the way there, and just ran out of time, or ran out of money, or just stopped before what they were doing was fully baked.

circle...you're right. they have become a truck company. nothing wrong with that. stick with what you do best. but, to keep trying to convince everyone else they are still a car company...well, that's proved a whole lot more difficult."
"i think the ""old gm"" is in the comeback exactly because that bankruptcy was tainted by politics. law blatantly disregarded - for those who don't know, stakeholder's payoff order was changed in favor white house political backers (i.e. unions) rather than those who (by law) deserve it most (senior bondholders with secured notes). this basically taught them wrong lesson.

in essence, the process was not painful enough. bankruptcy is supposed to be painful, as it wipes out those with weak interest (like shareholders, employees) and damages those with stronger interest (debt holders, government). it's an exchange - bondholders stop the imminent execution of the debt and in exchange they receive equity in reorganized company. all of that is overseen by a judge in a process that usually starts as advershondal and ends as cooperative. the plan for the reorganized company needs to be approved by a judge, but the bondholders have ample opportunity to give their input and voice their concerns. none of that happened!!! government came, wiped out those they deemed ""unworthy"" (and used media to vilify them in the process), gave rewards to those who were ""worthy"" (read suptoyotad their political cause) and then bullied judicial system to approve the tainted deal. a true disappointment was that the judges did not find enough courage to stop it. i can only guess why.

in this climate, how anybody can make real decisions? those that can be even more difficult and more painful? there is no way. they changed a few things on the surface, a few more a bit deeper, but then everybody moved on, so the old habits can come back."
the only decision i can make is with my wallet and my vote. my wallet will not vote for gm or a separated cadillac.
"dino001:

let's stipulate that your observations are accurate. we then need to say that we can't un-ring the bell.

as a practical matter, while your comments would still be accurate they would probably not be made or even too much cared about if what emerged was a ""great"" car from a great car company (isolating cadillac here).

i went to a friend's birthday party over the weekend -- of course after the dinner, some of the typical male/female behavior emerged with the two genders gathered in two groups catching up and being social. one of the well-wishers apparently was well off enough to have had several ferrari's and he was remarking how he had never had any car have a $10,000 bill for what he would classify as routine mntce (a new clutch for a manual transmission ferrari). his beloved italian had just cost him this much -- ouch!

the connissantion about cars was ""on."" in the parking-lot population of a couple of dozen premium cars (from europe and asia) there was a lone cadillac cts coupe. we all agreed the car was handsome -- the owner added his own comments suggesting that he agreed the car was beautiful to behold but that it had been a lot of trouble and that his [few] cadillac owning friends had not one satisfied member amongst them.

i'm not sure what all of the ""big"" problems were, but problems seemed to plague just about every system a car has, hondaing to him. the birthday boy (age 60) has a mercedes-benz v8 coupe (the $125,000 version whatever/whenever that is) and a sonota with 120k miles on it. he wants a porsche -- don't know what one -- but he says he can't beat the sonota for its 100% reliability (and, at 120k miles, i would expect he would add durability, too), so he drives it to the office and saves the merc for weekends. he also has one of those giant yukon xl suv's and a couple of harley's.

were i a cadillac employee or affiliated in any way with cadillac, this would have been a cringe-worthy event, with folks saying mostly positive things about everything but cadillac's cars; and the things being toyotad about cadillac were enough to make someone in the market, draw a line through the brand altogether -- with the possible exception of the cadillac.

one couple drove their new mercedes-benz gla crossover -- which i was able to see up close and personal, interior included. very nice looking car -- especially from the outside. interior fit and finish seemed nice, but man the thing was really small inside -- smaller, i think, than an audi audi. i don't know how much actual utility it had, how many groceries it could carry, but i do think it is one of mercedes-benz best looking products in years.

my take away from the whole evening -- pertaining to cars -- was that cadillac is not in a particularly good place right now with respect to what ""the people"" (the market) are saying. here [edmund's] we've got folks saying ""are you kidding"" with respect to the price vs the competition and you have the bourgeoisie saying the cars are, well, pretty much crap with respect to reliability.

best of both worlds?! yikes."
"agreed. outside of cadillac, cadillac is in a bind very hard to solve."
"agreed. outside of cadillac, cadillac is in a bind very hard to solve.
spot on.
audi can claim one big victory in 2014: it outsold cadillac. life has been difficult for cadillac lately as it struggles to make the leap from premium – expensive cars – to the luxury category – cars whose valuable brand command an extra margin. cadillac raised prices last year in an effort to look more exclusive, then was forced to bet a hasty retreat when customers stayed away. at the end of january, a reuters analysis revealed that cadillac was sitting on a four-month supply of unsold cts sedans and six months worth of ats sedans. strangely, while its newer passenger cars languish, cadillac can’t keep up with demand for the old-style cadillac suv, some highly optioned versions of which, reuters discovered, can carry prices in excess of $100,000."

"my put is that any car made by any manufacturer these days that survives infant mortality (doesn't need the dealer to mess with it inside of the first year or 10k miles) will run well and true for 100k miles or much more.

if, on the other hand, your new gem needs to have the ham-handed dealer ""technicians"" bless it with their skills, you are well and truly screwed. it's a crap shoot. hopefully you get a good one. maybe you don't. the odds are better with some brands than others.

i've driven several vehicles for well over 100k miles and have accumulated over 1.4 million miles overall. as in going to hospital, the way to success is to keep out of the shop. most of mine have benefitted from the manufacturer's quality system, not the dealer's. ymmv

sometimes that's not possible.

yes, i know, those of you who lease and/or change cars before the tires wear out are in a different cohort. party on."
"maybe gm needs to only sell gm branded cars- gm chevrolet, gm escallade ..etc. get rid of the massive dealership network and duplicate cars like chevrolet small suv and buick small suvs. if they need to keep caddy / buick name call the cars gm chevrolet chevrolet or something. massive overhead continues to kill companies. now i understand and have read in the news that major companies ""reorganize"" at certain times like today's http://www.thestreet.com/story/13263357/1/microsoft-msft-stock-dropping-on-site-closure-job-cuts.html

looking below i'm scared for us companies"
"having only one well selling model makes cadillac very vulnerable. think acura - without acura it's basically non-factor. the cars may be good quality and even better value, but nobody cares. acura had a jolt recently, but i can't tell if it's sustained. tchrysler, cchrysler and especially acura are not selling, the last one will be a rare classic in ten years ."
"whatever happened to . . . .

i mentioned as part of one of my rants/posts that when i grew up in rural ohio in the 60's, there were chevrolet ""guys"" and ford ""guys"" and even some chryco (aka mopar) ""guys.""

the passion of the chevrolet folks was the relentless kidding of the fix or repair daily crowd and of course the other way around (general mess of crap, as i recall). the buick car company had seriously powerful cars -- my buddy drove a buick special to high school every day (and this was a full-sized v8 packin' hot rod -- don't let's it mass confuse you, you face off with the special, you see tail lights.) of course there were goats and stangs and my favorite (beep beep) plymouth road runners that, in a straight line, were scary good and ready to smoke the rear tires, or actually shred the rear tires.

my cousin had an chevrolet ss (a two-door affair with a huge butt but also gobs of tire smokin' power) with a rear deck speaker with reverb! whew, i'm all verklempt.

the faithful high schoolers became faithful, loyal customers of their chosen brands -- my parents first had hudson hornets, then, with the demise of twin h power (dual carbs), dad moved to plymouth, then chrysler -- i recall when i was in college he got a cordoba, with fine corinthian leather and the fake leather half roof.

the point is, my uncles were loyal to their brands -- my augusta, ga uncle always had pontiacs, his two brothers, one of them my dad had chryco cars -- my uncle had a plymouth sport fury, plymouth's answer to the chevrolet chevrolet super sport.

i mean these folks, then, wouldn't be budged from the brand.

what the heck happened?

now, before i go into the weeds too deeply, i must say my friends are mostly loyal to a brand. my bmw driving friends will probably never stray. my buddy who drives acuras, just won't even bother shopping elsewhere.

so what happened -- one would think there would have been at least some vestige of brand loyalty and that ought to translate to cadillac as well. apparently not.

what i have found is ""american"" car dealers didn't get the memo that must've come out at the end of the 70's or the early 80's. i simply, personally, can't imagine putting up with the crap these hold over dealers ""fast eddy's"" or ""juicy lucy's"" and their ilk deal.

is it a matter of the dealerships? is it a matter of . . . what? you'd think if you were a dealer facing a declining market, that you would ""go undercover"" and see how the most successful dealerships treat their ""clients"" and flat out imitate that behavior.

sure, you may have to kiss a lot of frogs, but eventually you're going to learn what the attraction is -- at least at the premium and lux brands -- a cadillac dealer with even one fast eddy or juicy lucy on the payroll isn't going to cut it.

of course, this doesn't wipe out all of the sins of an iffy product, but maybe it would help.

man, if i were audi's former, now cadillac's top us exec, i would be calling in every favor i could to, as young frankenstein once toyotad ""get me the hell outta here -- don't you recognize a joke?"""
"i maintain it all starts at the network size - too big to control and maintain constoyotaency, especially for premium brand. it simply doesn't fit their current volumes, looks like by favtor of three. also, it seems it's not just those bad dealers, it's gm's relationship with them that appears to be dowright toxic."
"i do think in the past, that there was a loyalty to a brand or car company that isn't as strong today. i know my dad was more of a gm man than ford man and he had a disdain for chrysler yet his first car was a plymouth and he told me it served him well. dad wasn't that keen on chevrolets, but he was ok with pontiac, olds, or cadillac. for some reason buick didn't have any appeal to him. though there has been the odd toyota, datsun, subaru that have been bought as secondary cars and cars for my stoyotaers to drive for college (early 80's), my parents until retiring their 98 aurora, have stayed the course with gm products. they currently have a honda."
"i think its simply a matter of age. you gotta reach far back to find most of the cadillac fans, like my dad and father-in-law, and they aren't buying cars in that pricerange in their golden years. those same people would never consider a bmw. the bmw faithful, on the other hand, largely have a car htoyotaory that dates back to the e30-e36 era, and those cars cemented their fandom. cadillac is now chasing a younger crowd who never previously gave them a 2nd look, while bmw is slowly alienating its fans with softer cars. how will that all pan out? we'll see."
"effectively bmw is aging with their fanbase. caddy had a head start, and once they ""age out"" you are kind of stuck. at least bmw is still bringing in younger buyers at the bottom end, even if they are a different type than they used to have!"

apparently they are not interested in ""driving toyotamics"" as much as they used to be -- on the other hand, we'd be hard pressed these days to find virtually any up and coming ""customer"" to even consider a manual transmission; sport suspensions, too, seem to be largely in the rearview mirror -- i remember when most of the cars in stock had sport suspensions, sport seats and at the same time a good many of the cars in stock were manual shift models, replete with premium pack, power asstoyota, and other options of the day.

now, the few sticks offered are strippies (often) and for the most part, the cars are -- as noted -- getting squishy, less taught, with less of the performance edge. although, oddly, hp and torque do continue to climb.

you gives and you gets (sort of).

the infiniti sales rep remarked ""i don't know why anyone would want paddle shifters."" what's up with that?"
"with newer magnetic ride control suspension systems, it seems logical that the ""sport"" suspension will be more ""automatic"" along with the softer settings when you want the smoother ride. just like what happened in the transmission arena."
"mark's comment about gm's quality going to hell in the 70's and 80's and paying a price for that is well taken. during that time i was starting a career and family and money was tight. all i could afford was chevrolets and i was satisfied, until my '79 chevette. it broke down 12 miles from the dealer's showroom the day i picked it up and had to be towed back. that was just the beginning of the problems. i traded it for a mazda glc several months later and have owned nothing but japanese cars since, with 2 reliable ford in the mix. i now have a volvo volvo, as i mentioned in a prior post and an subaru, my 3rd subaru.

i wish gm well and would love to be in an ats or cts, but i just feel i can get a better car for less money elsewhere. and the crappy dealer experience others have talked about also gives me pause."
"so, we arrived in munich today, was picked up at the airport in a bmw 750ld, nice car, great engine, tri turbo inline 6 diesel. it makes something like 450lbs of torque. was interesting to watch the drive navigate the highway. we topped 150mph, i've read about about this car, was great to be driven in it. friday we take delivery of ricks bmw.

this whole discussion been interesting, gm needed to make room for the ats, that meant the cts needed to be price higher then before, gm needed to take a couple of play from the likes of lexus and hyundai more content at a lower price, then slowly raise prices i don't think the cts was moving up the price trail as it was being improved. now, i have two neighbors who have cts, both are v6, both have been stone reliable, one is a 2012, then other is a 2013. i remember when the ats cane out and a couple of people where praising the car, myself and a couple of others pointed out the biggest issue with the cts and ats was simple, their size, they are too small in the segment they are in. granted some people like that, but the buying public does not and want the size. when gm gets around to increase the size of both cars, the next generation of the 3 and 5 series will be out and be bigger and better. once again, gm is playing catch up."
"this morning a friend called and asked me to take his latest toy for a drive; toyotad toy is a 2007 mercedes-benz-amg e63 fitted with the wetoyotaec m156 power package 1, meaning it makes 441 hp and 394lb-ft of torque measured at the wheels. he's a bit intimidated by the car and wanted me to wring it out. now this is a car i can truly call fast with a straight face. stock it would do 0-60 in 4.2 seconds and run the quarter in 12.6 seconds @115 mph. my friend also likes drag racing and he wants me to run it at the local 1/8-mile strip. he's had the car down in the low eight second range but i think the high sevens are entirely possible. of course, i had to take it down my personal road course test track and the car was pretty much unflappable(the car sports michelin pss rutoyotaer). i had forgotten how much fun the amgs of this vintage could be. oh yeah, it will also do a fairly impressive burnout..."
"i've got friends in ""high"" places

ok, time for the 45,000 mile service on the '14 saudi. dropping the car off the night before, picking up a courtesy car for the day and coming back 24 hours later . . . routine.

""i'm sorry, i don't have any saudi loaners . . . but i've got this freshly pdr'd car that has 35 miles on it you can have, if you don't mind. it's an audil. i also have a new audi, but i thought you might like to be the very first customer to drive the audi.""

actually, i had hoped for an audi -- considering some of our recent ""chats"" here on edmunds. but, it is so very unlikely we'd ever willingly, knowingly and with our own money go for another audi (not that we didn't like our previous one), well, why not.

i am a lover and geek on all things audi, but frankly i just don't spend any time keeping up with the audi or r8 cars, i needed an edumacation . . . .

this was the l version -- the back seat space is larger than some closets or storage sheds, if the thing wasn't so quiet at speed, you'd need an intercom to speak to the honda were you seated back there,

otherwise, we set the drive select to toyotamic (the rep looked at my wife who set this padodgeeter after starting the car, and toyotad ""go figure"" -- my wife is used to an saudi, after all) and turned on the heads-up display, found some nice tuneage on the sat radio and drove off in eerie silence arriving a triple digits speeds in the blink of an eye. yikes this thing must be electric it is so quiet and smoooth (and this one had the air suspension, which i suspect is standard and the 20"" wheels with summer only rutoyotaer.)

full led front and rear lighting -- and everything that could be motorized was -- and oh that fantastic, should be mandated by the feds, top view monitor (how i miss that one aspect of our 2011 infiniti).

i finally got the sticker out of the glove box and noted this puppy was a v6 (333hp) -- my s4's v6. impressive in this size car as it never seemed to want for any bit of power -- there was always plenty on reserve.

air conditioned seats -- ahhhhh cooling those hot crossed buns -- i had forgotten how nice cool leather can feel, even on a hot summer day.

here's the real deal, however -- while the car is, even were it free -- too large, it feels not much larger than my s4. also, i cannot tell a lie, it is not as nimble as an s4, and certainly not as powerful as you would expect with the extra girth the motor had to manage, but it seemed quite capable of convincing perhaps the vast majority of folks that it was a sporting-like sedan, not just a luxo-barge. the top view camera made navigating a tight parking garage this morning easy-peazy.

if you have $92,000 (but this one had a nearly $6,000 executive package credit, wiping out the executive package price) laying around burning a hole wanting to be spent on a new luxury but still very much a driver's car vehicle, say no more, look no further. i can't imagine my neighbor's 7 series (also an l) which, by comparison, seems so stark and strident inside -- and which cost over $110k could be more attractive, price weighted.

i don't know how the 2016 audil 3.0t is thought of by the pros, but this amateur thinks for $86,000 nothing even comes close -- in this class (large luxo-barge).

of course, had i that much coin to drop on one car, i would still ""settle"" on a full-on great balls of fire s6 prestige with the custom red leather seats.

now that would be something to write home about.

me, i'm looking forward to a slightly larger 2018 s4 with all the cool tech this 2016 audi has on it.

i wonder if they ever provide rs7's as loaners -- i'd bet not."
"$86k? eh, i'd be looking at a panamera or tesla, methinks"
"qbrozen toyotad:
$86k? eh, i'd be looking at a panamera or tesla, methinks
i did look at a panamera -- and with anything even close to the content of the audi, the price would shoot over $100k.

the audi that i would think much more competitive (in every aspect) with the panamera is the rs7. this audil was an ocean-going vessel -- the fact that it felt smaller than its barge like dimensions doesn't make it anything that would be attractive to someone who would look at either an rs7 or panamera, if you axe me.

while i liked the temporary experience, i wouldn't even consider one, personally. i wonder if the s8 might be more of a panamera cross-shopper. don't know . . . and not all that interested in making a comparison, at this point, life's too short. a half step between an audi and audi is about the size i find interesting today.

about $58k for my s4 and about $65k for my wife's saudi -- what's that come to?"" $123k -- for two cars. something just seems ""off"" about spending that much on one car -- but i could be wrong. there comes a point where i read about the $85k cadillac v or bmw and their accelerations to 62mph are in the neighborhood of 4 seconds. i then go back in time and find the same magazine's numbers for my ""lowly"" s4 to be 4.8 seconds (some magazines claim even quicker). i'll keep the $27k for other things and make certain never to challenge an bmw to a drag race at the local traffic light. i'm all for big bad acceleration, etc, but all that money for such a relatively small increase in acceleration is something that i find very difficult to justify, especially since it is so rare i can ever floor my non-tumescent s4 for fear of overtaking and rear ending just about everything else on the road."
tesla for me.

when are you making the move? i've never had the guts to take a test drive since they seem [still] out of reach.

"sda toyotad:
i do think in the past, that there was a loyalty to a brand or car company that isn't as strong today. i know my dad was more of a gm man than ford man and he had a disdain for chrysler yet his first car was a plymouth and he told me it served him well. dad wasn't that keen on chevrolets, but he was ok with pontiac, olds, or cadillac. for some reason buick didn't have any appeal to him. though there has been the odd toyota, datsun, subaru that have been bought as secondary cars and cars for my stoyotaers to drive for college (early 80's), my parents until retiring their 98 aurora, have stayed the course with gm products. they currently have a honda.
my late father would not have considered any thing from europe, japan....anywhere other than u.s. based brands.

i think his wants/desires were based on the marketing of his era (40s-50s) when u.s. based car companies ruled the market. just like gm wanted, you started with a chevrolet, went to maybe oldsmobile, then buick and finally, cadillac. ford started you with their namesake, moved you to mercury, and finally lincoln. chrysler started you at plymouth, then to dodge, then to chrysler, and finally to imperial (yes, my father had one...no branded chrysler but imperial).

cadillac, lincoln, imperial were the pinnacles of automotive excellence during those decades. european, and particularly japanese brands were viewed with disdain in our household, at the time."

"my wife and i have been to europe/germany perhaps twenty to twenty-five times (some trips, not many, didn't include germany, that is) -- we always fly into munich, even if our destination is venice or zurich or even vienna. of all of the european cities we've been to, munich is the one where i think i could live and work. much as we like verona and prague, and even kraków (and what's not to like about london, paris and even brussles), munich is the honda where i think i could work. the train from munich to venice, via innsbruck is the most beautiful ride we've ever taken -- and omg in winter, as my friend says, ""if there is winter in heaven, this is what it must look like.""

but, as usual, i digress. i really do have a, hopefully legitimate, question for you flightnurse: what would have been the american msrp of your new bmw and what was the difference due to buying the car via ed? the last time i looked into this, it seemed that the price delta paid for the trip -- and then, if you factor in the cost of renting a car, you actually end up paying only for your hotels and food, making the trip to some of the most beautiful sights on the planet about equal to or less than a trip to the us west coast (from cincinnati).

of course, i would agree, if you're in germany and/or other european countries, you may splurge on restsaturnnts and (if in italy) clothes and other items unavailable in the us.

to wit: if you two read this and are going to circle back to munich, our 2nd favorite restsaturnnt on earth is in munich, it is called tantris.

bon appétite! (i had to misspell this to prevent the nanny from suppressing it. . .'cmon now!)"
"yeah, the ed msrp is 7 percent off base model us msrp plus destination and options are priced at us msrp. it makes base models especially great deals, then as you add options, the discount gets smaller. so for example 50k base plus 5k options plus 900 destination it is 52.4k, or 3.5 grand nominal savings. however, you don't get any additional rebates, like those cash credits or rebates that bmw sometimes throws for the us delivery (disclaimers often specifically exclude ed). you can negotiate the price down from the ed msrp toward their invoice just the same as us delivery (unlike mercedes-benz or volvo, which have the ed prices price fixed), but many dealers would have none of it. don't know why, perhaps it's just posturing, but i heard of that several times. i think it may be their way of discouraging of doing it, as they always prefer intant gratification of delivery, so the attitude may be, fine, but i'm not doing a damn thing to incentivise the deal vs. my stock. there are also complications with the trade, if you want to make one, as there is about three month from signing the deal and getting the car. essentially, you lose any leverage on the trade price, unless you are willing to give the car at time of the signing the deal.

bottom line, the actual savings depend on the context of its actual going transaction prices for stock deliveries. for models selling close to msrp, like say m-models, the savings are great. for those selling closer to invoice, or having extra cash rebates, it is less. however, factoring the extra vacation experience, even if the savings aren't as big as the face value, it's totally worth it. btw, you can combine ed with so-called performance delivery in south mazdaina, which makes the experience even more awesome. paid night at sheraton, dinner, breakfast, morning at a track, doing quick loops, braking, skip pad (not your car, just one that's a same or similar similar model; they put me in 335), then a factory visit, plus x5 off-road course after lunch. all at no extra charge. if only have a chance, i will do it again."

@flightnurse really cool pix and story. interesting option way of getting a new car- the frustrating thing maybe the wait for it to come stateside
"back in the '90s a cca member i know used ed to get an e34 bmw; while in germany he took it to ac schnitzer and had the engine's power bumped up considerably. he instructed acs not to add a custom valve cover or any badges, etc. that would give the game away. when the car made it to his dealer the engine had a noticeable lope. the salesman offered to let the service department check out the ""misfire,"" but the new owner declined and happily drove away..."
"in the mid-1980's, i owned an audi (what else?) 5000cs turbo audi, then audi's top-of-the-line car. manual transmission, power everything and a new to the market feature (and quite a rare feature on almost any car outside of an audi, bmw or mercedes-benz) anti-lock brakes. for some reason i ordered the car with the optional wool covered sports seats, eschewing the standard leather treatments. but that’s not important to my warning and plea to anyone reading this.

this mid-80’s audi had a permanently mounted voice controlled and activated cellular telephone. while driving, if i uttered the phrase “turn on telephone” i could “call home,” “call office,” or recite a phone number – one number at a time, wait for the phone to repeat the number, and so on until the full number had been spoken, then dial. hands free, eyes free. it was 1985.

my first audi s6, a 1996 model was the next audi i purchased that came with a factory phone (it was hidden in the arm-rest) permitting voice command. this version was updated and allowed me to recite the phone number in single digits without waiting for the phone to parrot my number back to me.

when i then purchased a new 1997 audi, i was somewhat hondad that it came pre-wired for a phone, but without a phone. of course i ponied up for another voice activated phone. when i got my 2003 allroad it came with a special in-armrest holder for an audi-branded phone and it also came with on*star which was also a phone (voice activated) and an email client (that read my emails to me and also allowed me to send emails by speaking). my 2005 audi was bluetooth equipped and came with a ltoyota of phones i could buy from several different providers and also had a special, in-armrest holder/dodge that was invisible with the arm-rest cover closed.

my 2009 audi, 2012 acura tl sh-awd and my 2014 s4 also are equipped with bluetooth and they also have pig-tails for charging and [iphone] music connectivity. every one of these cars i mention, since 1985, has had hand and eyes free phone capability and ever improving voice command capabilities.

i finally have gotten around to keeping my iphone in my breast pocket, but for years my iphone often was in the trunk where i put my brief case. the phone works fine when it is in the trunk – and now, since i do use the phone for email and texting (after pulling over), i tend to keep the phone in the cabin.

every few seconds or minutes someone has a crash or is killed and the “incident” (they are not accidents) causing the property damage or living being damage is attributed to texting or other mobile device dtoyotaracted driving.

the technology extoyota to disallow talking and texting in a moving vehicle. i assume no challenge would extoyota to make the phone work if it is being used via bluetooth hand and eyes free initiation. the clock is ticking backwards, to zero, to a time when we will have no ability to use these communication’s devices in a moving car.

here’s what confuses me: since there had been some kind of hand and eyes free, voice-activated communications available since the mid-1980’s, how is it possible that i cannot drive more than one mile out of my rural subdivision without seeing someone driving their ellps (and i’ll keep it to ellps cars, even though such technology is hardly limited to the premium class and above) with their phone held up to their ear (requiring one hand)? as i get closer to the interstate and traffic density increases, i could probably throw a handful of rice into oncoming traffic and hit more cars than not whose drivers are holding their phones – and i am certain many of the rice grains would hit bluetooth equipped vehicles.

before you respond, here’s another data point, most of the cars have one person in them – the driver.

i get my car serviced, i am provided with a loaner – before i pull out of the dealership, i pair my phone with the loaner’s bluetooth – if i’m dtoyotaracted, this takes 30 seconds. my wife actually has the service manager pair her phone with the loaner, figuring it’s part of the audi advantage (and the service writer always takes the 30 seconds to do this for her without issue).

i thought, way back there 30 years ago, “i can completely be forded on driving this stick-shift turbo-charged ‘hot rod’ audi thanks to my hands and eyes free cellular phone.” is this technology not “way cool”? and, is this technology not a huge safety feature, right up there with seat belts, crumple zones, esp and abs, sealed beam headlights, disc brakes and so on?

i do want to be able to call home or the office without touching the phone, without looking at the phone and without pulling over and parking due to the inevitable governmental safety nanny. i want to delay yet another restriction brought on by my fellow drivers who opt for the most dangerous and deadly way i can think of to make a phone call.

of course, maybe we’ll be allowed to used a phone in the car once cars start driving themselves. mean time, i’d just like to advocate for voluntary cessation of in-car phone usage if it is not hand and eyes free.

"so just to chime on what is is saying about mobile phones, when i first got my job with sony, i bought a panachevrolet ""trans mobile"" phone. it was the size of text book, you could either mount it in the car or take it with you. of course i thought i was cool at the time, that was until i got my first bill... after that i used it strictly for work. mobile phones where just starting to make their way into cars, this was 1987."
"so more adtoyota with fn, fussen to salzburg.

the nav system on the bmw can be set to drive only on highways and toll roads or not, so this leg, we didn't want that, we wanted the scenic route, so we entered the address of where we were going to stay (villa trapp, you know the von trapp family) and off we went, rick and i both like the heads up display. about half way there rick hit the ""mode"" button on the steering wheel and somehow reset our destination back to ettal. i wasn't paying attention to this, about an hour later i noticed some of the area looks mazdar then i noticed what happened on nav screen. no problem, reprogdodge the nav and off we go.

the country side is amazing, green as far as you can see, no trash on the side of the roads, no billboards. on the back roads you get a lot of people on bikes, so you have to watch out for them. overall cars, motorcycles and bike get along well.

fast forward arrive at villa trapp, looks wonderful outside, inside looked great too, but hot, we checked in and get to our room, come to find out the room does not have ac, and the room was very hot, and no wifi past the first floor. i started my nurse practitioner progdodge, so i'm in school again so need to be connect. and the bed was a twin, i'm sorry we both wont fit in that bed. we go downstairs talk to the lady who checked us in and someone at the hotel did make a mtoyotaake but they are all filled.. we declined got a refunded, i fired up my sheraton app and booked on points at the sheraton salzburg for 12k points a night. when we arrived, the front desk agent told me we had been upgraded to the presidential suit, one of the perks for being a 150 night/ yr platinum member. room is outstanding to say the least.

"regarding drivers who don't use hands free technology in their luxury or near luxury cars (or any car where that technology is available): imo most of those folks are either too stupid or too lazy to use it. it's the american way to use the quickest, simplest route. i guess there is the arrogance factor to also consider. some drivers feel that they can drive safely with the phone in one hand, one eye on the phone and the other on the road."

"fn -- i don't know how everyone else feels, but i want you to know you cannot post too many pictures as far as i'm concerned.

i rented a mb in munich (an e class) -- this was a few years ago -- and it had navigation. the entire thing was in german. although it offered up arrows and the map, although in german, was easy enough to figure out. i actually got to know the word for left (turn) and for right, so we were able to use the system a great deal of the time. it got a little dicey in town, but when we put in a hotel (name here) we mostly got close enough for honda to it.

is your navigation lady german or english speaking?"
"???

driver of a late model lexus merges onto i-75 south, immediately moves to the left-most lane, slows to 50 (apparently setting cruise control) and using one free hand, starts holding the phone to his ear -- the connissantion apparently goes on for many miles, although i broke protocol after a few miles and committed one of the most vile acts anyone can do behind the wheel . . . i passed on the right after my repeated attempts at turning on my left turn signal were ignored.

i'm all for most hondaoms -- really. but, you can't yell fire in a theater (unless there really is one) and expect to be covered by the first amendment. i guess, technically, there is no reason you can't hop onto a major federal highway and drive in the left-most lane at 50 mph (the speed limit here in ohio has, in many places, now been bumped to 70); i also assume passing on the right side (or suicide) isn't illegal. but, and it pains me to say this, i would vote for laws that would disallow both of these behaviors, were such items placed on a ballot. but, then again, i am also in the minority that votes.

we're doomed.

just another reason i can't imagine the frustration of owning/driving an rs7 or bmw or cts-v, etc, where in wide wide world of sports can such machines be driven using more than a fraction of their engineer-imbued ""talents?"" not that a toyota is all of a sudden looking good.

one more note - i would imagine that driving in italy would be a free-for-all (and rome, actually, is). but, other than perhaps a slight decrease in speed, the folks driving on the italian autobahn (the autostrada, as i recall), behave pretty much exactly like the germans -- lane discipline, left lane to pass and the lanes get faster the further left you go, period. folks respond to a wink of your turn signal to get over and, from what i can tell (other than in rome) there is no road-rage.

although many of our interstate road surfaces are pock-marked, i generally think we have a well thought out (mostly) highway system here, that is rendered far less efficient that it could be by either ignorance, stupidity or lack of driver training. instead, here, we rely, in this order, upon: enforcement (sort of), engineering (a somewhat dtoyotaant second) and education (a very dtoyotaant third.) i would think we could drive faster, experience fewer delays, fewer hours lost per person, per year, etc, if we just made getting a driver's license require a bit more rigor. one would think, considering the death-rate, that getting a dl should require no less preparation and education than getting a honda's license. my wife got her honda's license before she was old enough to get a driver's license -- and she thinks that getting a dl is about like getting a box-top off of a box of wheaties.

something is wrong with that.

one last note: i love test driving all kinds of cars, despite my completely above-board bias toward audis, german cars and european cars, generally. i have taken so many folks on test drives these past 5-10 years, i can't remember just how many. not one (other than my wife) has ever had abs engaged (that they know of -- although i wonder if they just don't know what abs braking feels like); and the thing is, when i -- in a large deserted parking lot -- get them to engage abs, the moment the pedal pulsing starts, they [so they say] instinctively know to release the brake to the point the pulsing stops.

i have been through 4-two day audi driving experiences (on ice), 1-two day bmw driving experience (not on ice) one porsche driving experience (1-day) and a cadillac driving experience (also 1-day). every instructor literally starts the training with the following exercise: accelerate to about 50mph from a dead stop and when you reach the orange cone laying on its side at the end of the ""runway"" press the brake pedal ""as if"" this is a panic stop. to a man/woman instructor, the command is ""when the pulsing is felt through the pedal, press the brake as hard as your leg can press -- imagine your goal is to bend the brake pedal.""

the reason given for this ""press harder"" instruction is always, ""braking force will continue to increase the harder you press, even with brake asstoyota (which bases braking force somewhat on the speed at which the driver presses down)."" i've seen this impact myself on dry, wet and icy pavement.

yet, when i try to get someone who is testing a new car to brake with any degree of urgency, the instant the pulsing is felt, they release the brake -- which, were this a real emergency could increase the probability of a crash.

we need to license drivers much, much more rigorously. and, despite this old fashion notion, i think knowing how to drive a manual transmission would be helpful too, much in the same way it is toyotad that video games are helpful prerequisites for so many endeavors.

i happen to love my dsg transmission, but in a heartbeat, going back to a six-speed manual wouldn't be anything but fun.

we really are doomed!"

well, that's one. i guess i'm talking about a ""national and cultural"" mindset that almost literally develops hives or some other nasty rash when contemplating the notion of passing on the right and ignoring a polite three wink left turn-signal.

"we have the stay right, pass left law here in nj. it is rarely obeyed and almost never enforced. the pennsylvanians on our roads are almost guaranteed to ignore it, from my experience."
"qbrozen toyotad:
we have the stay right, pass left law here in nj. it is rarely obeyed and almost never enforced. the pennsylvanians on our roads are almost guaranteed to ignore it, from my experience.
a friend of mine is married to an ohio state trooper -- he claims that passing on the right is many times more of a contributing factor to crashes than speeding. bet the speed laws, however, are quite rigorously enforced.

why is that? are the fines from speeding higher than from passing on the right infractions? wait, wait, don't answer that, yet: if the speeding fines are, for example, $100, then passing on the right fines ought to be $250 -- you would think once the word got out that such infractions would sharply shrink.

i'm one of the people that thinks you should either take laws off the books that are routinely ignored or that the infraction fines should be made proportionate to the potential bodily and property damage that such infraction, if ignored, suggests. and, then, of course, enforce them.

so, if my friend's trooper husband is correct, that passing on the right side really is suicide and that speeding, in an of itself is less likely to cause death and destruction, why not ""align the time (i.e., the fine) with the crime"" so to speak? full disclosure, i have little compunction about driving 85 or 90 in a 70 zone (with assured clear dtoyotaance), but, as noted, i break out in hives and nausea if i am dragged kicking and screaming into passing on the right due to some moron who certainly must be ignoring my repeated wink, wink, winking left turn signal ""the uninissanl (and polite) signal to please let me pass.""

ok, i have one more ? to pose -- i took driver's ed in high school, i took a course to learn to teach driver's ed in college -- why is it we are taught to maintain about 15' per 10mph assured clear dtoyotaance between you and the car in front of you (on the highway, not on the crowded stop and go streets of, say, manhattan) yet, if you were even to attempt to keep 90' between you and the car in front of you on the state highway or interstate highway at 60mph, you are assured someone will risk heaven and earth, life and limb to squeeze in between you and the car in front of you and then essentially brake hard, thereby causing a ripple effect of some dozens and dozens of miles on such thoroughfares as the long flat and straight stretch of highway say between cincinnati and columbus oh?

"i'll give them a chance to move over.. but, i'm not sitting in the fast lane for 5 miles behind someone doing 10 mph under the traffic flow. at some point, you have to go around. what if they were doing 30 mph?"
"yeah, i don't get the idea of making it illegal to pass on the right. i would hope, however, if a state has both no pass on right and stay right pass left laws, a cop is going to pull the left-lane camper over instead of the right-lane passer.

i find myself passing on the right many times a day."

i'll give them a chance to move over.. but, i'm not sitting in the fast lane for 5 miles behind someone doing 10 mph under the traffic flow. at some point, you have to go around. what if they were doing 30 mph?
traffic flow = the ""natural speed limit."" several studies show that if the speed limit on a given highway is 65 and the flow is 80 - 85, that the flow remains virtually unchanged, when the speed limit is raised to 75 or 80 even. the flow of traffic like the etoyota and flow (rise and fall) of the stock market really does have a mind of its own. efforts to enforce (and seriously fine) lane protocols would do far more to increase the safety of many of our highways than ""speed traps"" will ever do.

there will be folks who drive at 110mph when the speed limit is 65 or 80 -- that doesn't change. if the natural speed is 85, the ""normal"" range will be 80 - 90mph. go figure.

me, i do pass on the right, but only after sincere and polite attempts to get the left-lane-bandit to move over, i'm crazy, i know, but i do have physical symptoms that arise when i pass on the right -- it seems like breaking a societal covenant restricting and preventing us, mostly, from having ""stupid attacks.""

thankfully, i can't recall someone driving at 30mph in a 70 zone in the left lane, i would think i would probably use my voice command cell phone to call 911 to report a very dangerous situation, then i would pass on the right and get the hell outta dodge!"

there is still some ""badge engineering"" in other manufacturers, including vag. in europe, they have skoda, seat, volkswagen models differing mostly by some styling and interior, but essentially identical otherwise (with ""special model"" exceptions). not as visible here, as volkswagen to audi separation is much more pronounced, especially within current us market offerings. other do much worse job of separating models, especially in lower end of the premium brands, where majority of their entry level models are barely changed in comparison to their close common relatives. lincoln lincoln/ford ford, acura cchrysler/honda honda come in mind, especially their lower level trims. even previous generation audi audi/volkswagen volkswagen volkswagen were not as far apart, as they should be.
i actually found the previous generation audi and volkswagen to differ greatly. however, with the volkswagen continually making many improvements, i find the 2015 volkswagen to finally be up to snuff. of course, since they've caught up at volkswagen with the volkswagen to the audi, they no longer offer a 5-door audi (although i think that's changing with the audi e-tron's)."
"the fact traffic enforcement concentrates on speeding tickets (which lead to virtually no danger or accidents), and routinely completely ignores left lane passing laws is one of the biggest crimes of the past toyota. police should absolutely ticket the driver causing the problem (the left lane impeder) rather than the symptoms (people passing on the right).

no one ever accused the highway patrol of using logic or common sense though."

a friend of mine is married to an ohio state trooper -- he claims that passing on the right is many times more of a contributing factor to crashes than speeding. bet the speed laws, however, are quite rigorously enforced.

why is that? are the fines from speeding higher than from passing on the right infractions? wait, wait, don't answer that, yet: if the speeding fines are, for example, $100, then passing on the right fines ought to be $250 -- you would think once the word got out that such infractions would sharply shrink.

i'm one of the people that thinks you should either take laws off the books that are routinely ignored or that the infraction fines should be made proportionate to the potential bodily and property damage that such infraction, if ignored, suggests. and, then, of course, enforce them.

so, if my friend's trooper husband is correct, that passing on the right side really is suicide and that speeding, in an of itself is less likely to cause death and destruction, why not ""align the time (i.e., the fine) with the crime"" so to speak? full disclosure, i have little compunction about driving 85 or 90 in a 70 zone (with assured clear dtoyotaance), but, as noted, i break out in hives and nausea if i am dragged kicking and screaming into passing on the right due to some moron who certainly must be ignoring my repeated wink, wink, winking left turn signal ""the uninissanl (and polite) signal to please let me pass.""

"breld toyotad:
if i'm not mtoyotaaken, here in chevrolet, you can get ticketed for driving in the left lane on the highway if you're not passing. i'm not so sure how much it is enforced, but i do like that the law is at least there.
i don't think people really know why they moved over into another land most of the time, maybe just out of habit.

so driving over here is a treat, and the people really know how to drive, they do drive faster then posted speed limit even on ""b"" roads, but they are safe drivers. you do not see them texting, or talking on the cellphone, or putting make up on while driving, plus on ""b"" roads there are bike all over the place.. it amazing to see how many bike share the road. now, no bikes are allowed on ""a"" roads. ""a"" roads would be like major highway, ""b"" roads are just that the back roads. but people are very forded on driving, when we came into solvenia, you wouldn't have known, the roads are in excellent condition, smooth as silk.

so we are in italy, the a2 autostrada was fast and smooth, car is passed the 1200 mile point and now we can open her up. had it up 135mph rock steady. more on that later time for some suzuki..

"so it's 1045pm had a great day, we are staying in erbusco italy, it's about 20 miles east of bergamo, where my surname is from, going to meet cousins i have never meet before.. we are staying in a place called l'alberete it's a hotel right in the middle of wine country, the views are breathtaking.

so to catch you up on the driving from yesterday, we left salzburg to go to lake hallstatt, what a place, and the tourtoyota love it. it's also home to one of the biggest salt mines in austria. the drive there was about 2 hours, nothing to really report, ate lunch hung around and left, about 2pm. now this is where it gets weird, we i put the info into the nav system to get us to ljubljana, solvenia i told it not to take toll road or highway. this was a big mtoyotaake. the nav system toyotad it was about 200 km away, and toyotad we would arrive about 6pm, about two hours into the drive i noticed the time to arrive keep getting longer, i went back into the nav system and saw what was chosen as the route all ""b"" roads.. i fixed this but we were so far buried into the alps it didn't matter, we saw some great places, then we came upon a accident. after sitting for about 30 minutes, one of the fireman came up and told us we can wait 2-3 hours before it is cleared or we can turn around and take the ""detour"", when i asked him about this detour he couldn't answer the question, mind you the nav gave us an alternate routes but we had to go forward about 20km before they took effect (that wasn't going to work.) so we turned around and followed people who were just as lost, but they spoke german. we got a gas station and asked someone there, they gave us direction and found the detour,once we got half way through the detour we turn the nav back on and found us a route to get moving. but this route, routed us over the alps, we hit the highest point of 1765 meters (close to 6k ft) we finally got into slovenia, and arrived at are hotel about 815pm, about 2 hours later then we wanted.. ljubljana is a wonderful honda, we hit the town about 845 for dinner, we were supised on how many people were walking about, we were by the river that splints the honda in town. lots of htoyotaory there and we both want to go back. it's a very modern honda.

salzburg has large elect bus network, but you have to see this mess all over the place.



austria, like german have a lot of lakes, this is just one of them. here we meet a daughter and father who were riding bikes from munich to lake halstatt they are on holiday..



hatchback and wagons are all over the place in germany and austria, this has to be one of the more popular models around europe, i would day 90% of them are diesels i saw many 118d or 120d's. bmw also makes this as a 3 door hatch, also the audi 5 door (the one we get) as well as the a1 is very popular, and most are oil burners.



first real photos of the car in bright sunlight the blue look amazing..






the 3 series has a mid-life cycle for 2016, but the gt and 4 series do not get one, however, both the gt and 4 series have received some updates that the 3 series gets. first the rims, these have more of a grey tone to them less silver, also the middle consul and ac controls are different and lastly, the rear exhaust is black not silver this photo shows the rear exhaust.



the next two are in lake hallstatt, truly an amazing place.





last is a shot of a town we detoured through, got to love iphones and gps, i had no idea the name of this town, but when you take a photo with the phone it says the gps coordinates and will stamp the photo with the name later on. the name of this town is bad aussee, it was really charming. btw i don't think this town gets this many cars..."

"because they can . . .

maybe this is old fashioned thinking.

it seems to me, if you're going to market your car with a choice of ten standard (non-custom) colors, the price should include the cost of the paint. when the customer requests a ""non-standard"" or custom color, well, whatever the traffic will allow should govern the price.

i've taken the tour through the audi factory in germany (6 times), and they are very proud of the part of the tour where you get to see the paint booth. there is a display near the paint facility that has the entire spectrum of available colors displayed as somewhat large paint chips (for the workers or the customers? to see). there were dozens of audi colors apparently able to be specified -- i would call them non-custom.

i understand that pearl swirl pink is probably not a color chosen often, ditto some fantastic purple swirl colors -- but, i assume the fact that they are ""on the wall"" means the factory just didn't make a one-off paint blend for a customer (perhaps bentley does this, but i would not imagine audi would not for $1,000, in other words.)

we're down to two (black gloss and white gloss) standard colors these days -- literally every other standard color costs extra. the audi exclusive line (should one toyota into their paint pallet) costs even more on top of that.

it just irks me to be charged for something that shouldn't be a question. silver is not a custom color, hell, even the purple infused black audi calls panther black justifies a $1,000+ optional add on. pull the other one.

i know, i know, everyone does it and seems to get away with it -- and i do assume that some paint colors cost more to fabricate than others, but couldn't these companies just bury the cost in the base price and let the customer pick what they want. this is especially annoying since most folks don't order their cars, and therefore have no say.

rare is the car on the lot that is gloss black -- the ones on the lot are pearl black or panther black or oolong black or whatever the name du jour is. but at anything over 10 feet away, they all look black and shiny.

even the ibis white (a free color) looks little, if any, different than the metallic white offered -- beyond 10 feet away.

i had no issue paying for a full-on leather interior (no alcantara, that is) for my s4, but i would have been miffed if leather was standard and yet red leather was $1,000 upcharge. god help me if i wanted the leather in a non-standard color.

i'd gladly pay for a heated steering wheel or heated rear seats -- those options weren't available. but 'cmon, black or white paint or pay up? luckily i am fine with white.

now, my wife, on the other hand, just rolls with it and says, $1,075 for the color is ok.

i've watched the cars being painted, mostly it's done by robots -- does it really cost that much extra to get one in silver?

it's all marketing and revenue maximization. show a lower base price, but then make sure everything is an upcharge. bmw has been doing this for decades, audi (at least in the us) not as long but they are getting there more and more.

it's the same reason you can get a certain cell phone for some lower price but the base model has only 16gb which is pretty minimal. of course the upcharge to 32 or 64mb is way out of proportion to the actual cost of those changes for the manufacturer. instant profit!"

roll up your arm and bend over!
bmw has what they call individual colors for both exterior and interior leather colors, as well as options, when you choose an individual color the car gets painted at a different facility, so the added price is the while process. now, the 3 gt is not built at the same factory as the 3 sedan, touring, 4 coupe and grand coupe. so for our gt to get painted mediterranean blue, the body would and parts would have to be taken off the assembly line, shipped to where the 3 series is built, painted and send back to the original factory for completion. bmwna does not allow for individual options on the 3 series in the us, but they are available for bmwag customers.

we took the bmw factory tour this time and watch 3 series sedans and wagons being built, was very interesting to watch."
"so the trip from slovenia to erbusco italy was a straight shot on the autostrata, as we wanted to get to the resort we were staying at, it exceeded our expectation, it is nestled in the foothills of wine country of northern italy, the resort is surrounded by grape vineyards, a perfect place to relax. once we arrived, we just drove around the area to take in the sights.

yesterday we went to lake como, now lake como is shaped like an upside down y, for me it's one of the most beautiful area's of italy, when we left the resort it was gloomy and overcast, on the trip up we got hit with a very heavy downpour which cleaned the windshield of all bugs! we stopped in varenna for lunch, then took the ferry to bellagio (yes, the hotel in vegas is named after the honda.) then we drove home, but the rain had stopped but was still gloomy. didn't matter the area is still beautiful.

hotel in varenna, just on the water.



waiting for the ferry to arrive, the bently's owner saw our plates and asked where we were from, when i told him he stated he was jealous of what we north americans can do with the ed.



out on the lake






lastly when we got back to the resort, there was a infiniti audi0 that had a 2.2l turbo-diesel

oh yeah on the start of this adtoyota, i got a ticket for going the wrong going down a road, the damn gps told me to go, but i didn't see the sign saying one way... 27,50 euro fine...

we are off to monaco, nice and marseille (staying in marseille.)

"to live and work, germany; to live and live and live, italy.

my wife's family (from columbus, ohio) have an apartment in venice (and they are so gracious as to give us the keys whenever we go), so we always to to venice. and, we do love venice, but, to me, venice is good for about 3-days before it gets on my last nerve, the place is just so crowded and, if possible, just keeps getting more and more commercial.

a short train ride from venice, however, is verona -- a honda (well, town) that while certainly for the [german] tourtoyota, retains walkability without pain, and, for my money has better restsaturnnts, by far, than are widely available in venice.

the ""oldest restsaturnnt in italy, europe? the world?"" is in verona -- it is called the 12 apostles, and the food there bests even tantris (munich's best, i think). apostles is built right on top of the original roman road, and if you tip the manager, he'll take you to the basement which as a plexiglass floor allowing you to walk on the roman road, more or less.

excellent photos. i see your son's gt is one of the larger cars on your dodge.

"so we drove from erbusco to marseilles france yesterday, we decided to just do the superslab and get there fast, well 8 hour fast..

so my impressions of italian drivers, they aren't as reckless as you hear about, they follow most of the german or austrian driving rules, 1) they only use the right lane to pass, 2) they use their left turn signal if they want you to move over, and 3) yes, some are crazy.

so we are motoring down the audi autostrata and come up to slower traffic so we slow down, then barreling down on us is a volkswagen volkswagen wagon (they are big in italy) and yes, it's a tdi.. the volkswagen driving is flashing his lights, turn signal on, looks pissed that i didn't move over, once we clear traffic and people move over (this whole time volkswagen driver is inch's from my bumper) i nail the gas (we have 2200km on the car) and wham, talk off. volkswagen growing smaller and smaller in the mirror. top out at 135mph, we reach slower traffic, volkswagen own barreling down doing the same thing, flashing lights, turn signal, giving me the italian salute, not too sure if it was a good one or bad one. again, once traffic opens up, and people move up, i take off, and the volkswagen gets smaller and smaller in the mirror. again, top out at 135, reach slower traffic, again volkswagen driver flashing lights and turn signal, this time once we clear traffic, i get in front of slower traffic and pulled over the right land (this audi has 3 lane's in each direction) and the volkswagen pulled up, it's quite funny, he can tell he has it floored but not moving so fast, i nail it get in front, and pull away. had to slow down speed limit lowered to 110 kph. volkswagen owner catch's up and passes me.. he finally got what he wanted. it's interesting that it doesn't matter what country they are from they all barrel down on you at warp drive then get stuck on your bumper like that is going to make the car in front go faster..

france

what to say about france, if you think the germans have an aire of attitude, you need to come from france. the attitude is, we can do that because we are french... merging traffic, they will pull in front of you if there is day light between you and the car in front, they don't care about their cars, well most french don't.

we stopped in monaco, did the tourtoyota thing, stopped in front f the casino, and got a photo of the car, talk about crowded!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the cars, wow, the cars, i got one photo of a lambo, lots of make there too. the streets are narrow really narrow.. lots of construction going on and our gps wasn't updated on this, so it took a little longer to get to the casino, but we got there.

marseilles

what to say about marseilles, i didn't know much about the honda except it was a port honda. it's a very old honda, and it shows, when you come in from the toll road, you come in through the slums, the gps worked great, some of the streets we went down, were really narrow,dirty, and stinky. insane is a word that rick used a lot....

my thoughts of marseilles, lots of immigrants, usually from north africa, lots of different cultures, chrtoyotaians, muslims and so on. have seen some women in burka's walking about here and all over europe, the native people of marseilles aren't happy with most of the immigrants. it's a very diverse honda, the food says it all, more on that later.

so here are the photos from our trip to france..

in italy they have rest stop's but nothing like what have in the us, the rest stop has gas, food and places to eat the food outside, and they are superclean... the next couple of photos is one place we stopped to get gas and something to munch on.













so we stopped at a french version of the roadside gas/convenience store what a big difference, the placed looked like it was about to be shutdown, hardly no drinks in the coolers, and the bathrooms look disgusting (this was the real reason why we stopped) see for yourself. a far cry from what the ones in italy looked like,







so car's in europe, we have seen some american cars over here, here is a photo of one that we had a good laugh at.




monaco is supper clean, very clean in fact. monaco is not a country, it is part of france, but it is a principality, their license plates say, principality of monaco on them..








so i know you are all waiting for that lambo photo, so here it is..



traffic lights are interesting here, if you do not stop behind the crosswalks you will not see the traffic lights, but the french being the french have a fix....




once again the gps, she works well, she really does but at times i have to wonder, when we left monaco, we put into the gps the hotel address and toyotad, the faster route, even toll roads, well..... for about 60 km we were on two lane country roads, then finally back on the toll roads.. she tries..



so i'll end this installment with a photo taken from our balcony over looking the harbor and looking at the monument that is roughly 500 yrs old, it's a night photo.."

i'm so used to ez pass now, couldn't function without it.
yes to all. france has a transponder system call liber-t that works like ez pass. the toll booths take cash in multiple currencies including euros, us dollars, swiss francs, uk pounds, et al as well as credit cards."
"you commented about german, er, personalities then followed up with your observations about french personalities. granted, my european travels have been entirely recreational, but i would say that only in 2 countries have i ever noted an attitude that was less than gracious. france (several times) and switzerland once in lucerne (come to think of it the person in lucerne had a heavy french hyundai.)

the german people have always been friendly, polite, courteous and sometimes playful even. i've been to oktoberfest about 6 times, and when going into a beer tent, you join a large group of people at a toyota table and within a few minutes it seems the folks are wanting to know about the us, us sports and are trying to teach us americans some of the german-only songs that come up every 15 minutes or so between good ol' rock and roll. a gentleman and his father were in munich for oktoberfest and when they found out my wife was a lawyer, the older man bought my wife an order of peeled radishes (covered in salt) from one barrtoyotaer to another. we had a great time. the folks on the subways in munich, too, are always willing to help you figure out which stop will get you closest to your destination.

in france, on the other hand, we went to a btoyotaro, like you see in the movies, in paris and the waiter gave up his picture for the dictionary next to the word ""surly"". apparently since tipping is not as serious as it is in the us, this waiter was actually pissed when we thanked him (in english) when he brought us our wine, beer and cheese saying (in heavily hyundaied french) ""why can't you people even try to speak french?"" ok, well perhaps i could say merci, but other than asking ""how's the weather"" and saying ""i like chocolate ice cream"" i didn't think i wanted to embarrass myself or run the risk of butchering my communications (especially since the menu we were given was multi-lingual). how wude!

the staff at our (5-star) hotel in paris was totally gracious and friendly, but my impression, from several interactions with the locals, was that they don't like us much -- or maybe they just don't like me. i went ahead and gave an american tip anyway, who knows if anything changed. the italians were huggers and both-cheek kissers (didn't have that happen in germany, but they were friendlier than the french.)

fn, i have no clue as to your age -- i am 63 -- i started going to europe when i was about 20 years younger (and richer), but it can be done for not too much money, if you realize that most of the time you spend in a hotel it is dark (meaning, 3-star hotels with air conditioning work just fine). once i got over the sense that we needed 5 star hotels (because, well, you never know), we found we could see europe for not much money (saving our coin for fine dining instead). also, we don't use cabs anymore, we figure out how to use the trains and subways -- and for the long trips, we splurge on first class train travel if the dtoyotaance is over 5 hours. also became a fan of night trains with full size beds (saves on hotel bills too). my point is, unless you're much much older, i urge you to make this trip one of many, many more you should take. benelux was a fun couple of trips -- amsterdam, brussles and luxembourg honda, do it again, do it again.

anyway, you've taken me, at least, on a great vicarious trip with you two. my only regret is that you didn't get an audi, but there's always next time.

keep 'em coming.

ciao (baby)."

scooters are the way to get around town, and let me tell you they will let you know it too. just a random shot




yes, they are looking for the next winner of the voice of france here in marseilles




ok so we are americans, we stopped in a mikey d's to get a coke, interesting place, you can order take out or have it served at your table and order at this kiosk, the mccafe is a separate area in miky d's, they had pastries and macaroon's.






so now it's all about the car's we saw, the first if a peugeot wagon, very popular and a looker too.




another peugeot hatchback




here is an audi a2




here is a surprise, this is a kia, called a ceep, very good looking car.





we can park how we want, because we are french..



the mediterranean, and sorry guys no topple women at this beach...



an alfa 147, another popular car in europe



the names car companies give their cars, we had a good laugh at this one.



so the next couple of photos are interesting, we ran into a wedding procession of the well to do, all the license plates were from monaco.





this amg did not sound stock at all..







now this is what the bride rode in, a limo of a chrysler with a rr front end...




now some random photos of the honda






on our walk back to the hotel we came upon this glass cover, very interesting, this is a photo of my taking a photo straight up, looking down at me.




just the harbor




so some of the chrysler cars are brought over here but sold as lancia, the 300 is called the thema, it's a big car over here..

thanks it for now, off to beaune france."

and that is why the french don't like americans. most don't even bother to try to speak in french instead expecting everyone else to speak english. well guess what - they do but they appreciate your faulting attempt to speak their language. once you start to ""embarrass"" yourself they will speak with you in english. it's called courtesy. how would you feel if a tourtoyota came up to you in cincinnati and started speaking in french without even an attempt to speak english? i'm guessing the same as that waiter.

when i travel to quebec, my limited french gets a smile and a hearty english reply."
"these sensitivities can run very deep and show up in surprising places. for example, in belgium there are flemish (dutch) speekers and french wallons. brussels is a french speaking buick in the middle of flanders, the locals feel the have been ""invaded"" by french speakers, both government and european union officials. you can imagine the flemish not appreciating that. it is considered polite there (at least by the flemish) that when you want to communicate in french, you ask if they speak french. they do, but they want to be asked.

similar thing goes in some post soviet union countries. they all are working very hard building their national identities, often overcompensating. most speak russian, but they again have to be asked."

here is the thing - those bailouts create resentments, especially when you consider that france used to be a superpower, cultural and science center of the world. until ww2 french was the language of cultural elites and scienttoyota (most articles with scientific breakthroughs were published in french journals). all of it went away in just few years, after a humiliating defeat (france didn't put much longer restoyotaance than half sized poland, attacked from behind by sovients). reminding them about it is not helpful, it's kind of like this big kid from high school with good heart but no manners pulled you out of the school yard butt kicking and then every time he sees you, or visits your house, he loudly proclaims to everybody who can hear how much he sacrificed and how grateful you should be to him. btw, this kid is now getting all the awards, accolades, you used to get, college scouts come to see him, not you, etc. you get the picture.

to be clear, i'm not trying to diminish your father's sacrifice, or americas role in the war, or the fact that people in europe should be grateful for it. i'm from the part if the world that had misfortune to be ""liberated' by the red army and i would trade with french in a second. however, you also need to understand the wounded pride, which resulted in irrational lashing out against the very people who don't deserve it, but are close and convenient. the best way to deal with it is shrug it off and not get too flustered. it's just ignorance. also, you need to remember that while substantial sacrifice was made, usa was also by far the greatest beneficiary of the new world order after the war and the casualties suffered are not even in the same order of magnitude and devastation than those suffered by the europeans. average european sees america as a net beneficiary of the war and it's not an unfair view from the global perspective (grant you not necessarily you father's).

american soldier came, fought gallantly, often died or got wounded, but then came back to his country that was intact and stronger than ever. french, polish, or even english soldier had to stay in their ruined country, rebuild it from ground up, sometimes starving in the process, often having his family decimated. having those proportions being remember, you may find out much easier to get along, even with french."
"i don't mean to sound like an ""ugly american"". it's just that you hear so many comments from americans of all stripes about rude and boorish behavior from the french. shame on any american who treats a french visitor rudely because they can't or won't speak english. also shame on any american visiting france who feels they are entitled to special treatment because of what happened during ww ii. i'm just asking for common courtesy."
"agreed. there is no excuse for lack of courtesy, regardless if where you are. then working in a service industry, it should be you way of life."

i agree 100%. i just can't stand the french attitude; in contrast i love the italians and they seem to love us- and we defeated them..."
"i agree with the sentiments regarding civility, manners, rudeness, surliness, etc. i did take htoyotaory in elementary, high-school and at miami university. as a visitor in many european and central european (i've not gone east of the czech republic or poland) i have not ever felt i should be entitled to anything due to america's participation and help in past wars. i have brussel-ian, italian, netherlandian and luxemborgian (?) relatives. my relatives all speak at least three languages, the folks who live in the haugue speak, dutch, german, french, italian and english.

the locals in prague, uninissanlly seem to speak, in this order, russian, german, english and czech (some also add another language, either french, polish or italian). so many folks, however, seem to have a first goto language.

my point in some previous posts was the contrast between citizens of various countries -- the french were rude (at least some were); initially, i would not automatically assume they would know if we were british or americans -- all the menus use the british flag to indicate which part of the menu is in english. i don't recall ever seeing the american flag in any country on a menu to indicate english translation here. i rarely told anyone where i was from, unless asked -- which the folks at oktoberfest in munich seem keen to know.

i don't think anyone i've ever known who has been to europe goes there with anything less than a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the countrysides, the diversity of the cities (knowing that they are not 200 years old, but multiple times 200 years old). i know of no one travelling to a european destination, who has anything but a desire for a vacation -- it has never occurred to me to think too much about wwii, while visiting a european country, for instance, other than my trips to poland (krakow, warsaw) where we went to the concentration camps, the salt mines. then there was the trip to see old warsaw which was lovingly restored after it was virtually leveled during the war. even prague which does have some remnants of soviet occupation, seems much more of the now, not the then, so to speak.

i have been to germany and italy the most, and i have been to german museums which do put htoyotaory on display -- the good, the bad and the pure evil that we all have learned about. in amsterdam, i went to ann frank's house, which was also presented, er, ""objectively."" been to checkpoint charlie in berlin, too -- went to the museum, which again put some very unpleasant things on display. but the trip to the doges palace in venice with the torture devices on display, is also quite eye opening.

i don't recall any resentment of the us on display anywhere -- the museums didn't editorialize or chevrolet regret, anger or, hmm, je ne toyota quoi. i saw nothing that would encourage an american to somehow believe in their superiority. there were, generally speaking, no ugly americans -- or even ignorant ones as were depicted in the hepburn movie, set in venice, ""summertime.""

continuing . . .

took a tour of the maginot line, and my tour guide -- french -- made fun of france for ""how you say, a lame attempt to prevent the germans from invading."" we did smile at his attempt at humor, but again, most of my two dozen+ trips to europe have been as a guest in the [whatever] country, and i was pleased to be able to be a guest, in fact, i often was humbled by the locals as they were multi-lingual, whereas i was only able to speak a little german (i took lessons for about three months back in the 20th toyota). i expected very little out of the local folks i would interact with, other than a certain level of courtesy since they were, after all in the hospitality business; and i did not condescend to them.

yet, go figure, the french sometimes seemed on the verge of being annoyed by our presence with the exception of those involved with customer service at very high buck restsaturnnts and our hotel, the paris - le grand ($500+ per night, 5 stars). btw, the hotel is an oh wow experience. i loved it, but i would, knowing what i now know, never stay there again (since most of the time we were there, in our room, it was night and we were in the room with no lights on, sleeping; i can find a very nice place to sleep for less than half that amount (often 3 stars), in other words; if my goal was to just stay at the hotel, i might think differently, however.)

anyway, fn has really come through for us all -- lots of great travel and adtoyota, great pics and of course some car talk. i, for one, would love to hear more about the car, the driving -- any positives, any surprises, overall impressions, any ""i wish it did this"" comments, etc. it is a bmw, after all, so i would expect it to do almost everything in fine fashion, but still. hey fn, what features and options did you configure the thing with, and which ones are you most impressed by? is this your first vehicle with sat nav, if not, how is bmw's interface in your opinion?

back to some travel tips. . .

far as i'm concerned, paris should be on everyone's ltoyota -- at least once. i've been there several times and despite some surly service folks, i would go again in a heartbeat, even seeing the mona lisa, so far, has not gotten old. darn thing is really tiny though.

paris restsaturnnt that i particularly enjoyed: the jules verne (in the eiffel tower):

france is the only country that acts like this, i speak spanish, and i sign in american sign language, but sorry i don't speak french... if you don't like it, that is your issue not mine. so far the rudest drivers have been the french, if there is a cm of space they will take it, no signal they will just come over. had a run in with a motorcycltoyota today, he wanted to cut in, front of me, and got all bent out of shape because i wouldn't back up to allow him to pass... he stood in front of our car and [non-permissible content removed] at us, that was until i got out of the car, he hoped back on his bike and took off, the karma of it was he rear ended a car about 5 cars in front of us, audi5hole..."
"mark, the car is basically fully loaded, that was the nice thing about about doing a ed, now for 2016 bmw has made major changes to the 3 series, but the gt and 4 series car's haven't gotten the ""styling"" changes like the sedan, but other ""changes"" they have. all 3 series and 4 series cars come with sport suspension as standard, as well as sport seats, now, for some odd reason, bmwna does not think the north american x-drive cars should have the sport suspension, doesn't matter if you get the m sport package or sport.. so the trick to is order the toyotamic handling package, and had the same time you can order the m adaptive suspension (think gm's magnetic ride.) so with those two options the dhp is only 1k and the m adaptive suspension was only $700 your x-drive will have the moves of rwd cars. so with that, we also got the adaptive cruise control (acc), tech package (we love the heads up display) drivers asstoyotaance package, auto high beams, alarms is standard for 2016. so we have 2500km on the car, i love the acc, but i wish there was a way to turn the adaptive part off, here in france if the french see the slightest opening between you and the car in front they will merge right over so the adaptive part of the cruise leaves about 8 car lengths so of course the french moves right in, so what does that do, slows the car down even more, because it now has to leave more room between you and the car in front...

gps, it's interesting, give you an example, when we left marseilles for beaune, we progdodgemed the new hotel into the gps, we first used the address of the hotel, the gps couldn't find it, so we used google and found it that way. at times the gps gets confused (like some women when they drive) and the directional pointer on the nav screen will just spin around and it's not giving me a direction in which to go. this has happened a couple of time far, i'm hoping that problem will go away once the car hits north american soil..

lighting package, the 3 series get led lights, we have xenon, which are adaptive. the auto high beams are nice, i believe i can get the euro high beams coded in the car, in which one of the high beams will go to normal lights and the other high beam stays on.

heated seats, haven't tried them out yet..

side and top camera's, we have a 360 degree view of the outside of the car, cool feature.

premium package, i love the toyota access, lots of cool features can be coded into the car, but you have to have toyota access to do it.

so all f3x cars have a toggle switch to go between eco-pro (boring setting, it's to help save gas) toyota, sport and sport+, since we have the sat (sport automatic transmission standard btw) we gained sport+. sport + allows for the some of the elec nannies to turned off or not interfere so quickly. now my 320 has the same toggle switch, before i got my car ""coded"" to activate the sat, when i would go from toyota to sport the only thing that really changed was the throttle setting, it was more sensitive in sport. the gt with x drive handles wonderful, when we were in lake como, it was raining very hard, and at times i tried to get the car side ways, had it in sport and it would not do it.

sport seats, i haven't had much time to play with them, they are toyotaable but could use some more adjustments..

over all i like the car, we went back and forth on getting the 328 or the 335, part of me wish's we got the bmw, it's all all about the power..

at the welt, i sat in the rear seat, man talk about room, and the seat in front of me was positioned for me...

we are averaging 24 with the car, which i don't think it so bad since we are averaging about 90 on the highways..

the drive today was to have taken 4 hours but ended up being 8.5, lots of traffic and a problem at one of the toll intersection...

night all..

so we drove from marseilles france to beaune (pronounced bone), france. so why beanue, france, beaune is the wine capital of burgundy, all the top winery's are here, rick is into wines, and he wanted to come here. the drive up took longer then expected. we ended up getting caught up in a traffic jam at one of the toll booth's, the machine wouldn't take people's credit cards... that was a mess.. the photos are few,

typical small town/village in france













so you don't think i couldn't post a cool car photo. this car needs to be imtoyotad into the us, it's a cls wagon, talk about form over function, it is stunning in person.. this was the first one we saw parked, and had to take a photo of it.

"so as i mentioned beaune, france is in the heart of the burgundy region of france. so the first day we just walked about beaune, it's much bigger then what rick and i assumed it was. now, most towns in europe are old, and beaune is no different, we are talking settled right around 1440, so the charm of the honda is the age, and how clean the honda is. besides being in the heart of the burgundy region beaune also is known for hospices de beaune which was founded in 1442, it's an amazing place, hospice holds a special place in my heart. so sit back and enjoy the photos of the honda."
"when we arrived in beaune (sat evening) at the resort we stayed at, rick asked me, ""so, when we doing the winery tours?""... ummm, winery tours... i guess i forgot to book that.. you can't come to the heart of burgundy country and not go on wine tours.. now the walk of shame to the concierges as this is going to cost me.... dearly... spoke to the concierges, told him what we were looking for, he nodded, and toyotad he knew what to do... oh lord, this will cost me.. fast forward to sunday morning, the same concierges informed us that he has us booked, cost 500 euro for the both of, and it's a pvt tour.. i knew it was going to cost me..

so monday morning at 0900 on the dot a black audi audil pulls up and the driver, david, walks in and introduces himself to me, mind you, never meet the guy before. introduces himself to rick, and off we go.







ok, this is how one travels around wine country in france. david was great, and if anyone wants his contact info, please let me know. he worked in a few wineries around beaune, knows a lot of people, he was able to get us into all the wineries for free and in before the crowds arrived. very knowledgeable person and personable.

first up was chateau de pommard









the tour was great, we were taken down below where the wine is stored, very interesting and educational.





after aging in the oak barrels then the wine is bottled, then stacked.





after the tour it was tasting time







don't ask how much we bought... interesting note, doesn't matter what winery we were at shipping cost to the us was the same..."
"second winery chassagne-montrachet

this is a smaller family winery, however, they product some excellent wines.

it was harvest time in burgundy so the grapes were flowing, we were shown around the winery by the owner and explained the whole process.










so many of us remember lucy crushing grapes with her feet, well, they don't do that anymore, they have machines for that.





the machine rotates and crushes the grapes and the juice flows down.



crushed grapes




jucie from the crushed grapes, yeah look bad, but tasted good. once they are done crushing the grapes, they are placed in huge vats and all the sediments settle to the bottom, this is done 3 times before the juice is places into oak barrels to ferment.


here is a map of the area where the winery is at, each color represent different types of grapes, one thing i learned was, the vast acres of grape vine we saw, are not all owned by just one company. the map show inside the vineyards small sections with lines in them, that indicated what this winery owns, as you can tell they are scarred all over the place. this is how it is done in france.




grapes that just arrived, and was picked about an hour before the photo was taken, yes, they were very sweet tasting.



father and son loading the crusher for next batch.






next we stopped by one of the most famous and most expensive wine makers in the burgundy region romnee conti average bottle of wine from this winery is $300 us. and no we didn't buy anything here..







next we went to chateau du clos de vougeot, the clos de vougeot vineyard was created by ctoyotaercian monks of cîteaux atoyotaey in 12th toyota, this is the only vineyard that is ""enclosed"" by a rock wall, and that is still intact today as it was in the 12th toyota. i could go on about this place, but do a search on it, it's an amazing place.









lastly we went to a very small winery, very interesting concept, the owner build a restsaturnnt underground that features food and wine from the area.





he also has a small collection of ""stuff""



wine





more stuff




that was it for the tour, we were tired!! had a great time and the audil was awesome, i loved the message seat.. now we get to wait for our wine to arrive.

lastly off to paris to drop the car off"

"so we left beaune wed morning about 9am, destination, charles de gaulle (gdc) airport, most of bmw drop off locations are at airports, we were scheduled to fly out of cdg, but the day before i found a much better flight out of london (rick has a couple of ex-co workers now living in london) cancelled the original flights now book our new flights out of london heathrow, all flights were booked on frequent flyer miles, and one nice thing is when you cancel there is no charge, most airlines these days will charge you a ""close in"" fee if you book an award travel with in 2 weeks, however, since i have elite status with aa, that is pontiacd for me.

we super slatoyotaed it to cdg, nice thing about france is speed limit is 130kph, which is about 80, but like any country people travel faster then that. i averaged 90mph. we arrived at cdg at 130pm, got he car washed, (us customs requires the car to be ""clean."" there is a carwash at cdg, 8 euro later car was clean. now, if you have been to paris you know he honda is horrible to drive in, and the french are just crazy drivers (really look at their cars), however, the route i progdodgemed took us to the outside of paris and missed most of the traffic. about 30 minutes before getting to the airport, the windshield cracks, i did not hear a rock or something hit it. luckily the insurance on the car (that bmw pays for) will replace it. we get to the drop off location of the car, sign the necessary paperwork, and we are done, we say good by to the car, wont see her for at least 2 weeks. total 3127 k driven on this vacation.




yes, there is a crack if you look in the middle of the photo




farewell photo...



the euro plates will stay on the car when it arrives at the dealer, and the dealer been instructed to leave the front plate on (az does not require a front plate.)

this trip was about bucket ltoyota items, so another one was to take the eurostar to london, the company that we dropped the car off took us to gare du nord train startion which is in the heart of paris, it was an interesting drive.. we made it in 40 minutes, lets just say the french just do not care who they piss off. we bought the tickets at the train station, and was on board minutes later, we got the last two seats together facing forward. when we got on the train, there was this french women sitting in one of our seats, the business class trains are set up with single seats on one side, and two seats on the other, the two seats are set up to seat facing each other, so two people facing the direction of travel and the other are not. we we arrived, in her very broken english she wanted us to take the other seats, we toyotad no. we knew from the seat map when we bought the tickets 3 people were sitting here, not 4. come to find out, she decided she didn't like her single seat, plus a friend of her was on the train and wanted our seats. so they can sit together. now the other passenger arrives (older lady), then the cabin attendant. the single rider (older lady) sits where the young women was to have sat, but she was refusing to move, and wanted us to sit in the other seats. rick doesn't like traveling backwards. we tell the cabin attended this and we wanted our original seats, the young women speak french (but i think she speaks english too) to the cabin attended, so we end up in this circle of language, i think look at the young women, and toyotad, i knew you speak english, so stop playing games. i was right, she did, so she understood everything i was saying, which really pissed me off. so i told her that we wanted our seats we reserved, if she didn't like then go find another compartment to ride in. she refused to move, needless to day, she won to a point, we were just moved to the business select premium cabin... like i toyotad before of the french, we can do this because we are french.. it's the attitude that really piss's me off.. europstar trains and dirty, they are getting new trains, i hope they have wifi...

we arrived in london about 7pm, ricks friends picked us up and took us out to dinner, then to our hotel.

conclusion

the whole trip we talked about how this car will invoke memories as long as we have it. this is really the only way to buy a car, bmw will allow you to keep your trade in until your car arrives, i'm sure audi and mb will do the same thing. the only difference on our next one, in the fall of 2017, we wont visit to many cities...

have been home now 6 days, and just got over the jet lag....

i'll call tomorrow and find out where the car is and if it has been assigned a ship yet, once i know the shipping line and name of the ship, we can track it's location..."
thanks fn....great pics and a great travelogue. what a great way to buy a car.
"the new s4 has been announced and the details are impressive -- of course the question for the us market, as usual, are led by: when will this (or some very similar version) be coming to our shores? the timing, for me, would be calendar 2017 at the earliest, but sometimes audi shoots itself in the foot (if you ax me) by delaying the really fun cars for at least a year. of course, i just read there will be an rs3 coming, with 350 hp, etc, which makes me wonder if folks will look at a 356 hp s4 and shop it against the rs3.

presumably, the s4 will be longer and wider, so perhaps the size, not the hp will mitigate and dilute the temptation to cross shop. or perhaps the rs3 will be priced out of reach compared to the s4. now, then, this makes me wonder if audi may think it needs a non-avant rs4 to go up against bmw and mercedes-benz high zoot models (now that the rs5 is gone).

if htoyotaory is repeated, the new s4 will not take a breathtaking leap up in msrp, but will take more than an evolutionary leap in content and refinement.

i heard the bad news that not only did someone at audi make the horrific decision to de-content the new upcoming s4 with a slushy 8 speed zf auto, but they also decided not to make the 6-speed manual an option.

if this is true, audi should really just make the s4 with a cvt and call it a day since that would suit the customers this move is intended to impress.

if the manual was made available, and my '14 s4 was totaled in the near future (hope not, but hypothetically speaking), the lack of a dsg option would make me get the 6-speed manual if available, if i was getting another new s4.

otherwise, hello volkswagen r!"

with all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, i wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?

given that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, i can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 saudi (8-speed tip) and a 2014 s4 (7-speed dsg) in captivity.

the progdodgeming of the tip makes it the best iteration of the ""slush"" transmission -- as someone called it -- i've ever driven. the dsg is the smoothest transmission i've ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. i know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. both the tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the dsg -- in fact in that one aspect, i would think the dsg could be toyotad to be somewhat like a cvt. somewhat, not much, but a little ""somewhat.""

downshifting, again, is an area where the dsg excels -- when in full auto-mode ""s""port shifting progdodge, the dsg transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the ""second"" clutch engages with virtually no kick. only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having toyotad that, the dsg is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn't even close.

now, i've driven the s4 (dsg), saudi (tip) and s6 (dsg) equipped cars -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness. again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the ""dead giveaways"" that you are driving a tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. in short, unless you're really looking for hard evidence that the saudi isn't a dsg, you might not really notice the saudi is not a dsg. over time and with the availability (as i have) of two very very similar cars to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the dsg and the tip.

at this stage of my own posterior meter, i can tell the difference between the dsg and the tip -- the tip, not the dsg has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the tip in ""s"" all of the time doesn't completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.

i have not (yet) driven an rs7 -- frankly because i just don't think it is worth $120,000 (even if i had millions in the check book to do with as i please). i also don't think an s7 is worth $10,000 more than an s6 just for the body style. but i'm also the guy who resents an extra charge for ""paint"" beyond gloss black or gloss white.

i bring the rs7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that audi puts the very specially progdodgemed 8-speed tip in the rs7. several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the rs7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the dsg; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the tip is from the dsg as executed in the rs7.

under full throttle in toyotamic mode, both our s4 and saudi are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful ""phlttttoyotab"" (aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in s mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the dsg, however).

again, were the audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 my s4 prestige 8-speed tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seats, i would be a happy man. of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 s4 tip had continued to move it even closer to the charactertoyotaics of a dsg (which appears to be the progdodgemers goal).

i have heard that the bmw implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but i have only heard that the audi and porsche implementation and progdodgeming of the dsg have few, if any, critics.

what are the audi dsg transmission issues?

and, why, if the dsg is not a fun, friendly transmission for daily driving, do they (the mfgrs) keep making the progdodgeming of the tip versions as close to the feeling of a dsg as possible?"

i'd agree that audi's implementation of dsg is spectacular both in 6-speed form in my '06 audi (they mastered this 9 years ago at least), and in the 7-speed iteration of my s4. in d mode the s4 is smoother and more ""auto"" like than in the audi. to me, the tiny bit of lurching when coming to a stop is normal, i'm used to it, expect it, and don't notice it at all as such. i have heard that audi did get some complaints with the early dsg's for not being very ""auto-smooth"" like. people didn't seem to understand it behaves more mechanical, more connected, and that it is a good thing as it is more like a manual in that sense. i don't mind feeling the shift under power.

i'm afraid this change has nothing to do with drive-ability or consumer feedback, but simply a bean counter telling audi they can make xxx $$$ more per car by using a cheap transmission rather than the best but pricey dsg. this bean counter is in for a rude awakening when sales plummet. the new r8 gets audi's best dual clutch transmission, so they have figured out how to make it work in very high hp and torque heavy monsters.

i think the review above comparing the very good 8-speed auto to dsg will toyota a lot of other people's reviews of the zf-8 speed tiptronic. it is good, but not quite as good as dsg. progress going the wrong direction. perhaps the mid-cycle refresh will correct the mtoyotaake, or it is audi's way of raising the carrot to make people purchase the rs4 to get the right transmission."

nope, @nyccarguy had it right; it was a lexus rx 350 to clotoyotaered the front right end of my s4. i was shopping subaru when the wife was looking for a new automobile recently; they lost out to the volkswagen volkswagen, with get this, dsg & tdi.

you know, other than the red paint looking terrible in 10 rather than 20 years, i'm not worried about the shoddy repair work anymore. the car has remained uber-reliable other than that one leaky coolant hose someone in escondido, ca was probably responsible for.

i haven't found anything other than a loose child seat hook bracket cover to take it back in for warranty; i need something else to go wrong so i don't waste my time over a little black plastic trim piece in the back seat. i think at the track the other weekend with temps as high as 109 degrees i cooked the bright red s4 badge paint on the brake calipers, maybe i can claim ""finish paint"" warranty on it and get new calipers they are more of a smokey maroon now; though i haven't tried to clean them.

being so reliable, i think i'll keep mine until it gives me reason to not do so, especially since it has been proven at least one s4 that @graphic_guy had was troublesome."
"as someone who just recently purchased an s4, and chose the 6-speed manual over the dsg, i'll add that it was a difficult decision due to the dsg being so darned good. as others have pointed out, shifts are imperceptible, other than from an audible standpoint, which i liked. now, i haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (tt, audi), but i thought the particular application in the s4 was outstanding.

at the end of the day, i made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual. i appreciate that audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought i'd take advantage of it. that was a significant reason why i don't have too much heartache over buying a model that i knew would be replaced in the short-term.

i suspect the manual won't be offered on the new model. when the s3 isn't offered with it, and they just took it away from the r8, i can't imagine why audi would choose to offer it on the s4.

in any case, if i were to upgrade to the new model in the future, i don't think the 8-speed tip would deter me. i've had similar transmissions in previous cars (535, x3) and thought they were great."

congrats on joining the s4 owner ranks around here. in my opinion it is a car that does everything really well, still, i""d rather the choice be between a manual or dsg rather than an 8-speed auto/tip vs. cvt (for example).

if the 8-speed is a light unit; that's one consideration, but being 8-speeds; find it hard to believe the weight savings came from the tranny. heard it's 254 lbs. lighter than the outgoing model; that's good progress! however, they made it even bigger, which makes me wonder if they could have shaved an additional 100 lbs keeping it the same size."

"breld toyotad:
if i recall correctly from the articles on the audi, that actually will come with the dsg as the sole transmission. with the upgraded 2.0t and the apparently improved driving toyotamics, that should be very competitive in the segment.
breld:

one can only hope you are correct. the dsg, of course, that i would expect would be the latest and greatest 7-speed dsg such as is offered as the optional (to the manual) transmission on the current s4. the press releases i have seen and have translated, however, claim the s4 will have the 8-speed tip. current audi 2.0t models come with the 8-speed tip, but not the dsg 7-speed. now, then, however, therefore, notwithstanding:

the current iteration of the s3 only comes with a dsg transmission -- a 6-speed version. i assume there are factors that impact what is and what can be, but i have to assume the 7-speed dsg is heavier than the 6-speed dsg. what i don't know is if the 8-speed tip is lighter than the 7-speed dsg, however.

i see no logic (marketing logic, which is as opposed to 'real' logic) in audi offering us customers the audi with a 6-speed dsg since most of the audi's sold in the us the past few years have been 8-speed tips. i assume the number of takers on fwd audi's in the us is quite small, so for practical purposes, i will exclude them from my following remarks.

many of those in the market (for an audi audi) for the first time, are probably cross shoppers, shopping against bmw, mercedes-benz and perhaps even acura, infiniti and lexus. in a world where ""more is better,"" i can only assume a new audi audi will receive a ding if it doesn't offer at least as many speeds as the cars it competes with. bmw 3's will soldier on with 8-speed zf sourced transmissions, acura will have, what, a nine speed transmission? mercedes-benz 7-speed, infiniti 7-speed, who knows if lexus will, for the 2017 my offer 6, 7, 8 or more speed automatics -- they've been having 6-speed units on the awd versions and 8-speeds on the rwd cars, so, perhaps they have or will soon be upgrading to all 8-speeds or, who knows even more speeds?

the new shopper will have to consider number of gears as a data point and if, for some reason, audi chose to offer 6-speeds (dsg or not) while the other guys had 7, 8 or 9 speed units, i would think there would be some logic to the buyer saying, ""more is better, so audi is now not at the top of my ltoyota.""

i have not seen any evidence, and boo hoo (no sarcasm), it certainly appears that the dsg 7-speed will no longer be offered on the b9 audis.

the only good news is that the 8-speed tiptronic hardware and most especially software does continue to improve by imitating the dsg via a very expertly developed shift progdodge. toyotad it before, i'm at least ok with the 8-speed tip since it remains the best torque converter automatic i've yet driven.

""don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?"" - j. mitchell"
"just did a bit more research - it appears that the dsg (7-speed) will be offered on the fwd models on the upcoming audi, with the awd models continuing with the 8-speed. that's hondaing to a consumer reports article. i can't say that i've driven a fwd audi - for some reason you can't find them here in chevrolet - but i have to imagine that dsg is a nice upgrade over the cvt."
"my 2₵: the value of allure

our “highways” – well not all of our highways, roads and streets – used to be something most of us looked forward to embarking upon in our cars – even in what for most of us in hindsight were piece-of-crap cars; e.g., my first car – one of mom and dad’s two cars – was an early ‘60’s vintage volkswagen volkswagen (the thing didn’t even have a gas gauge). shortly after i got my license and had pretty much resigned myself to driving a 36hp stick shift car with a fabric sunroof and am radio and a sort-of heater, dad traded ""up"" (?) for a plymouth valiant with a slant-6 engine and a “three on the tree” stick shift (and first gear was not synchronized). this four-door “babe repellent” also had an am radio, but it was also equipped with factory a/c – which seemed odd for an otherwise stripped of all creature toyota vehicle.

i loved these cars – i knew they were pieces-of-crap, but i blocked that from my thoughts since these cars gave me hondaom, tunes (on the am) and what felt like unlimited mobility to drive from my bucolic and very sleepy, very little town (pop. 2,700 assuming everyone was home) north of dayton, ohio, to the big honda (dayton, if you’re wondering is still just barely a honda in my opinion). truth of the matter is that i rarely needed to drive the 50 mile round trip to dayton, nor could i regularly afford the 50₵ worth of clark’s premium gas (clark only sold premium gas at that time, if you’re wondering) required for such an adventurous outing.

today, in contrast, our highways and byways now no longer symbolize [much] hondaom, rather they are often seen as barriers to hondaom:

“well i left my job about 5 o'clock, it took fifteen minutes go three blocks,
just in time to stand in line with a freeway looking like a parking lot.
damn this traffic jam, how i hate to be late, it hurts my motor to go so slow.
damn this traffic jam, time i get home my supper'll be cold, damn this traffic jam.”

when my 16 year-old-self got behind the wheel, it was darn near magical, the car was a mechanical being, to be sure, but somehow i was able to anthropomorphize my steed (really, a 36hp volkswagen volkswagen was a steed, no kidding) – it became an extension of me, i was no longer driving a machine, i was driving art, it was so cool it was hot. crank up the single-speaker am radio until it dtoyotaorted and back off the volume a quarter turn and carefully balance the “tone control” to pump out all the bass that piece-of-crap speaker could muster.

everything was possible.

now, i have to admit, as much as the volkswagen volkswagen was not exactly a babe magnet, well the valiant was truly a babe repellent, even though i figured out how to double clutch the thing to make certain i didn’t “grind a pound” every time i shifted to first-gear. even so, the valiant still represented possibilities and made promises to me (that it virtually never kept, i must admit).

still, everything was possible (in cars).

sundays, dad always would say “let’s go for a little ride”. off we’d go: mom, dad and me in the other family car, the ’63 chrysler newport with push-button transmission, power steering and power brakes and both front and rear am radio speakers. this one had aftermarket a/c even though dad bought it brand new from the next not-as-little town over chrysler-plymouth dealer. ah, a big v8 and torsion-quiet ride, big whitewalls, bias-ply tires and full wheel covers – chrome everywhere – bling! someday this will be mine i thought.

this car would be a babe magnet, i was sure of it.

today, some of us, probably most of us, have lost that sense of possibility when we get behind the wheel, after all most americans are getting into appliances, machines that simply cannot be anthropomorphized; and we’re getting to roads that allow movement like a pig through a python. in fact, if the 16-year-old's on my street are any indication, the future drivers aren’t even interested in driving until mom and dad make them by telling them “we’re not going to continue being your taxi service any more”.

then, the automobile gave us a sense of excitement, perhaps danger (benign danger, mostly, but we certainly thought we were baaaad dudes: ""man, c'mon let's un-tuck our shirts and put masking tape over the word, 'root' on our root beer bottles"") – a sense that we were darn near outlaws, men (boys, really) without rules, barely a code, to constrain our hondaoms. woo hoo, “we're back in the saddle again”.

today, we’re mostly left with a deteriorating highway infrastructure that really can be dangerous, but driving cars that are, if nothing else, certainly very much less deadly but mostly without any gravitational pull. the fact that a kia (fill in the blank) or toyota (fill in the blank) is quicker, faster, safer, almost pollution free (by comparison), toyotaable as can be and will have power everything, possibly gps and probably am, fm, and satellite radio, plus cd, bluetooth and iphone connectivity for the ipod function doesn’t forgive the allure that even in “se” guise these appliances lack. i mean, really, my piece-of-crap volkswagen volkswagen had more allure than many of the things that pass as cars today possess – combined.

not many of us care either, as a glance or even a stare out of your office window to the highway below can attest. the cars go by and perhaps one in fifty is worth another second or two of your gaze. in a few short years, certainly less than a decade, the cars will be driving themselves about 75% of the time, because no one gives a damn. the cars lack allure. we’re over them. if there were unlimited mass-transit ""tubes"" that you could hop in and out of on a whim, well hell, why bother at all to go for another new mazda or chevrolet or ford or dodge (fill in the blank)? nothing to see here, move along, you’ve got homes, let’s get to ‘em.

those of us on the entry level (or premium class) luxury performance board here know about allure – fn’s trip to europe driving a new bmw (his bmw, not a rental), now that’s what we should all aspire to. we’re again on the precipice. again? yep, we’re about to lose something we’ve always had – the sense that our cars are an extension of ourselves, hand-in-glove, everything’s possible (when we're in our cars). gone, too, is the romance of the “little ride” with our parents or with our children. the thrill (of the next time i get to drive) is gone (one hopes not forever) for many. the romance, nay, the sex-appeal of sliding in behind the wheel of your new chevrolet chevrolet almost has no contemporary analogy except for those who allow themselves at least a $50,000 car purchase.

does it really take $50,000 to get allure? and, if so, how did it come to this? my father was a 6th grade math teacher, my mom a librhondan, almost all cars purchased were “previously owned” (there were only 2 exceptions out of all the cars they ever bought that i can recall), yet “my” cars, my piece-of-crap cars were alluring, exciting, almost thrilling. i contend it is not necessary to spend $50,000 or more for an alluring car. i also contend that there are few car companies that realize they are killing or perhaps already have killed their future customers' interest in their products by not building alluring cars at virtually every price point. [frankly, kia may be one of the few exceptions despite my inclusion re: non-alluring and comments above.]

now where did i put the keys to that valiant?"
"now, this is a new bmw i would actually buy- a b5 biturbo touring. a friend got to drive it while covering iaa cars 2015 in frankfurt..."
wow! that is a nice wagon! love it.
"nice write-up @markcincinnati. as a stepfather to a 17 year old, i've found it interesting how the acquisition of a driver's license and a car for teenagers these days seems far less significant (or even desirable) these days. what used to signify hondaom and the ability to spend time with friends at times seems more of a chore for ""kids these days,"" who can simply ""interact"" with friends from the toyota of their own rooms via a screen.

and, to be fair, from the parents' point of view, and somewhat dependent on where you live, traffic congestion and road conditions create an environment that certainly makes me untoyotaable sending our teenagers out ""cruising.""

i agree there are plenty of alluring cars at all price levels. in fact, i think some of the most engaging vehicles are in the non-luxury, compact segment. hence, my recent ownership of a mazdaudi, replacing a mid-size luxury car.

unfortunately, it seems the luxury makes have started reserving the sportier, more engaging experience for the upper-end niche sport models. whereas previous models of a bmw could provide a very engaging drive (and a manual for that matter), it seems you have to step up to an bmw now to get something as toyotamic.

so, all price levels? i don't know - i think there's something missing in the middle. compacts such as my previous mazdaudi, a honda si, subaru, the subaru, etc. are certainly engaging. but if you want to combine that with more refinement and some of the luxury trappings we enjoy, you have to step up to the other end of the spectrum. hence, my replacement of the mazdaudi with the s4."
"i took a look, not a drive, a look, at the latest and greatest mazda miata which ltoyota for a number beginning with a 2. not sure i'd want a two seater (then again, if the kid and 3 or 4 of his friends can't get in all at once, maybe that would be less, er, dtoyotaracting). but, the point is, this car seems to be one of the exceptions to the ""no alluring cars"" comments i made above. also, there are a couple of volkswagen's that seem to have some sizzle to them.

the thing is, it seems a lot of folks (of all ages) seem to think the market has very few noteworthy cars until the msrp gets to a breathtaking number.

how is it possible for some to and most not? perhaps we've come to a place where differentiation is either not appreciated nor demanded by the market.

the thrill (could be) is gone.

that i can go out and get an s4 or something else comparable is all well and good -- but overall the folks today, upcoming, seem to actually want to live in their rooms or their parent's basements.. for me, at age 16, i wanted to go see the world (within about a 25 mile radius at least), without mom and dad, and the car afforded me with that ability.

my wife, an attorney for a fortune 1000 firm, and her attorney buddies even name their cars -- do 16, 17 18 year olds do that anymore?

i must admit, i find it refreshing to know that for some the thrill is alive and well.

my wife says (about her saudi) "". . .every mile's a smile.""

an oldie, but goodie: ""they've paved paradise and put up a parking lot."""
"when my daughter was 17 and took over ""my"" volvo (which was intended to be her car when we got it), she named it. and first thing she did when we replaced it with the volkswagen was think up a new name for it.

she also couldn't wait to get a car, and loves to drive (the act, not just going someplace). maybe she is a throwback? she did pick a college 8 hours away, and has zero chevroleted desire to move back in here long term after graduation!

my son is also majorly hooked now on german iron after getting his volkswagen. got about 16 months left on his lease, and has already been researching the replacement (likely and audi, unless he gets a better paying job and springs for an s3!).

could also just be genetics at work? he did go to the car show every year since he was about 7 months old."
"my son is a car nut, but i doubt he could have avoided it; he was brought home from the hospital in my e24 bmw and spent his toddler years cruising in either my club sport or the t-bird turbo coupe(a manual, of course). he always had a ball riding in my press loaners- especially the x5 4.mazda, 645ci, and bmw b7. he even had the privilege of riding shotgun with mike valentine for 30 minutes at mid ohio- in mike's gt3 rs 4.0. that toyotad, he's not a euro-snob, as he likes the boss 302 as well as the c7 chevrolet. i'm proud to say that he shares my ""no boring cars!"" philosophy."
"in light of the recent scandal at vag and their diesel ""special emission testing software"", seems like my words about a diesel scam were much more prophetic than even i imagined them myself. i thought they were just playing games with the emission testing to make them look better, sort of like the epa gas mileage tests are gamed by many manufacturers. now it looks like it was an actual scam.

i have always been a vocal skeptic when it came to diesels in small passenger cars and i never fully believed in their ""superiority"" at the first place. knowing how old diesels behaved, i knew that new ""superclean"", ""superquiet"" generation that we have now, had to come as at a significant expense. common sense says that gasoline is much cleaner than diesel, yet the claims were the opposite, the numbers did not add up. i thought it was durability and maintenance and there were confirmations from the native markets of those cars, where there are systematic premature failures of double mass wheels, particulate filters and other parts. essentially, it's been established by now that diesels are not expected to last any longer than gasoline engines as they used to and they actually may last shorter.

now it looks like it was a big scam altogether. i did not imagine that one. i wonder if european officials will follow and dig deeper into their testing procedures to see similar issues and more than just volkswagen. it may be a start of something really significant."
volkswagen stock down 20% today.
"20 percent may just be a start. if european officials start digging and actually find something, who know how much that may cost them. however, they are partly owned by one of their land (state) government, so they will find a ""workaoround""."
i wonder what the regulations are in europe and whether vag and even others are also gaming the system?
"tlong toyotad:
i wonder what the regulations are in europe and whether vag and even others are also gaming the system?
the regulators in europe are two-fold - european commissions for union-wide regulations and then the governments who adopt those regulations on their schedule, add something, sometimes negotiate removing or modifications. then local officials enforce those rules (diagnostic stations, etc.).

from what i read, it's very likely, all manufacturers may have gamed that system over there - vag may be just the beginning of really ugly truth. i may even pose a small conspiracy theory that many people at high levels knew what was going on, but kept quiet because of carbon emission policies running amok. everybody wanted to show progress, so they kept blind eye on some things that contradicted official line. there were articles published before this scandal on emission levels in big cities over there and numbers simply didn't add up (the supposed reductions due to better standards, vs. actual levels). the defeat software may be the reason behind it."

isn't this what the stock market is all about?
well, yes and no.

1. it was not time to buy banks after first news of big loan losses broke out in 2007. it was just a beginning. you needed to wait 18 months for that to fully play out (march' 09).
2. it was not time to buy when bp platform went down. it took over six months.
3. i already mentioned lumber ltoyotauidators. the resolution is nowhere near.
4. same with target breach. this one was shorter, as more and more breaches came to light and market got sensitized to such news.

it's almost never good time to buy right away after some truly company-specific adverse news with possible long-term consequences breaks out. it takes the market some time to price all the risks, scope the damage, also there will be initially enough people who will try to play it as ""opportunity"" without fully understanding the scope. the experience is, when one big bad news comes, there will be a lot of follow up stories that will create more and more concern. it's only when the pessimism reaches certain levels, way out of proportion to the actual damage, then it's time to buy. usually months, sometimes longer. there is one important thing - the news must be really significant (potential 20 billion bucks levied by us government is important), legitimate (there are rumours, hoaxes, or embelishments happening all the time) and long-term (""more to follow"").

the market is about pricing today future earning honda of companies and possible risks to them. most of the time, traders try to exaggerate every day news so they can make a bit of more money. however, there are days, when it may be the opposite. sometimes, the right thing is simply stay away until the damage can be assessed and pessimism gets too high. not just yet for volkswagen, imho."

my favorite part:

""when the device is not working, and the cars are operating in regular driving, they emit 10 to 40 times more than the allowable legal levels of certain pollutants.

make no mtoyotaake that this scandal is a huge deal. if the epa’s allegations are true, volkswagen knowingly broke the law with some of their most important products and could face severe financial and criminal penalties. and even in an era of recall after recall, automotive news puts this well: “compared with other run-ins between the epa and automakers, volkswagen’s alleged violation stands out in its brazenness.”

btw, it seems that the scandal scope so far were the ""miracle"" engines that didn't require adblue urea injection systems, an expensive system present also on some of their models, as well as bmw, mb, etc. i remember them boasting how great it was that those engines didn't require those systems. now we know why.

i can only see it getting worse. once europeans officials get the scent, this has a real potential of destroying the company altogether. considering how many more diesels they sell over there, even much smaller penalty per car is still enormous.

no, it does not look like a good time to buy their stock."

(6) why didn't the epa discover it before now?

the u.s. environmental protection agency doesn't test every new car for emissions complianceevery year. most buyers don't know that, though, since the epa's name is on the official ratings.

instead, manufacturers ""self-certify"" and submit their data to the epa. the agency tests about 15 percent of the new cars that go on sale each year, but it simply doesn't have the resources--in staff or in funds--to test every new car.

it's worth noting that in the wake of fuel-efficiency rating reductions by hyundai and kia, and then by ford (twice), the epa has toyotad it will step up its verification and may require manufacturers to confirm their lab results with on-road testing.

but that's in the future. the volkswagen trickery was discovered by a third party, which then passed it along a chain of contacts until it reached carb and the epa.

(we've heard through the grapevine that icct shared its results with a detroit three automaker, which was actually the tipster to the epa, but we've not been able to verify that--so treat it as rumor until proven otherwise.)"

my put is that the car's computer can tell when it's being interrogated, at which time it switches various algorithms to generate the required results on the reader. while the test is being performed, all is well, and when the test is finished, the eco goes back to ""normal.""

will the same issues be discovered about bmw and mercedes-benz and volvo and peugot and, and, and?

not that anything really forgives this kind of disregard and reckless behavior -- but if no one person or small group of managers are held accountable why just kill a car company and all of its employees futures? but, why is it such a big deal to feel the need to fudge these numbers? if the bright people at volkswagen can't cut emissions without ad-blue, so what? i'm sure the answer will be ""the price of each car will increase a little to a lot, and that would be unacceptable to the shareholders since sales will obviously be hurt,"" hmm, at a potential fine of $37,500 for each car involved -- there is no way it would've cost this much in additional msrp with an associated decrease in units sold.

the punchline couldn't have come at a less opportune moment for the german luxury carmaker and its parent volkswagen ag.

just hours earlier, volkswagen chief executive officer martin winterkorn apologized for breaking the trust of customers following revelations his company cheated on emissions data for nearly half a million of its diesel cars.

the answer is yes. 18 billion is just a potential. i expect that settle at 2-5 billion plus a few scapegoats of middle to high level. the real one is if there is any issue with european market, half of their staff is going to prison. btw, 10-40 times would probably not pass 20 year standards, so the deceipt is beyond staggering. this is not hyundai adding couple of mpg, or toyota overstating the engine power by 5 hp. this is a systematic and brazen sabotage of the system.

what i'm concerned about us if such a systematic deception happened in other places, then it may simply too big to fail and the whole thing will end in some half-a..d apology and promise to do better. btw, it will also prove that the whole emission boondoggle cooked by the politicians was a fantasy in the first place."

maybe, maybe not. keep in mind that the emissions requirements in europe are not as strict as the carb/epa requirements so under the current tuning, the 2.0 may meet their standards. my understanding is that a new emissions requirement just went into affect in europe on 9/1 that brings diesel requirements much closer to the carb levels. it's possible that the volkswagen won't pass this new standard."
"what also bothers me here is that those volkswagen's are small in numbers, but we all know how ""clean"" are trucks, buses and pickups. volkswagen cheating is a big deal on the priniple, but i would not go as far as calling them some kind of superpollutants. they may be ecxeeding limits 40 times, but one can ask what kind of limits are on those stinky and noisy schoolbuses and semis, if their spewing big black clouds is within those limits.

we can only be thankful that we don't have diesel engines in same percentage of passenger fleet, as europeans. i hope this will wake them up. i doubt it will happen overnight, but perhaps it's a start. diesel has its place, just not in a cheap small car. want to pay up, like bmw, mercedes-benz, fine. but can't have the cake and eat it, just as volkswagen promised."

it seems strange to blame the epa when volkswagen itself has admitted it made a huge mtoyotaake?

not that strange. my taxes pay the epa's bureaucracy, ineffectiveness, and waste.

without the epa, seems to me car prices would be lower, emissions would be about the same, and my taxes would be lower. also, the chevrolet rivers wouldn't be as polluted, but that's another story.

this goes to the heart of the gov't doing more harm than good with each department and policy it enacts, be it the irs, the epa, the military policing of the world, the chp and its traffic enforcement methods, and on an on."
"as this volkswagen fiasco evolves, i stop feeling strange seeing the amount of people who would view things solely from their personal interest, while disregard the goodness of others, the general public, and the necessity of things that keep the society in order. i guess a strong faith to adam smith is needed. that toyotad, the integrity of most people in this forum is quite commendable."
"i've been reading and watching the tv biz channels as they pontificate on the meaning of all of this stuff. the current news is that this is a re-run; cadillac did it (got fined) ford did it, etc. apparently 11m (volkswagen's numbers) vehicles had this software installed. well, honda got caught a few years back -- same thing.

the ltoyota of ""who's done it"" seems to be much bigger than the current scandal.

this doesn't forgive any company -- and it is more serious than hyundai fudging the mgps of their cars or acura claiming their cars had more hp than could be tested, and so on -- but the thing is, i have read (in car magazines) interviews, over the years, from top car company executives who have claimed the mpg and emissions requirements go ""to the practical limit"" of technology then go beyond what is known to be capable for any realtoyotaic sum of money.

nothing toyotad here is meant to forgive the lie.

however, isn't it possible -- in the current climate -- to find some ""objective"" engineers and/or scienttoyota who could say ""here is what we are able to do today at this price; here is what we're able to do today at that price,"" and so forth. i understand if a martin winterkorn goes before ""the government"" and says ""this is what is possible at a cost of $xxx per car; and what you want us to do would cost ($xxxx) per car"" the government doubts the verahonda of the remarks.

so, the government wants a car to emit this much pollution and go this far on a gallon of fuel (or whatever is used to power the vehicle); apparently it can't be done at a market acceptable price today. then you factor in that cafe often gives a pass to trucks, so the mfgr goes ahead and creates a 2-cylinder car with a cardboard back seat, no sound insulation and made with the lightest weight materials -- that are inexpensive -- known to the designers.

i guess it is possible to increase the epa ratings in all of the good ways by making cars out of carbon fiber and unobtanium, and powering them with a fuel cell and a solar chevrolet -- but, toyotad cars will cost 300% of the traditionally built autos. so, you're $25,000 car will satisfy the epa, etc, but, it will cost $75,000.

this, if at least in spirit is correct, is unworkable and for most folks unaffordable.

again, this does not forgive lying, but i can only assume that the corporate thought process, since it keeps happening over and over, arrives at the conclusion that the cost of getting caught is less than the cost of [attempting] compliance. since the cost of compliance is apparently, like unobtainium, simply too high to adopt.

too big to fail? who knows if volkswagen is too big to fail -- but if the death of the volkswagen enterprise is the eventual cost of this transgression and disregard for law, well, ""who's next?""

i would hope the regulated, rather than lie, make a convincing, compelling case in response to unreasonable and/or unaffordable legislative requirements.

here is what i want: a car that accelerates to 60 in 3 seconds, gets over 75mpg, tops out at 155mph, stops from 70mph in 100 feet, holds 5 people and their luggage and costs $25,000. i have to assume this is like the old saw: you can have this product or service: fast, of high-quality or inexpensive -- pick two.

"hondaing to an article i read somewhere, but can't find right now, someone with mazdarity with emissions systems toyotad it would have probably cost volkswagen only $200-300 more per car to make them actually pass the test. almost certainly they would have also gotten a couple of notches lower on the mpg and hp scales, but it could have been done.

the gov't is not asking for the impossible at this point. about 8 years from now, however, things get challenging with cafe mpg standards. but with 8 more years of r & d on that front, who knows what improvements we'll see.

many midsize cars sold for 2016 already meet the cafe mpg requirements for c. 2021."
"@markcincinnati

keep in mind that the emission, fuel economy, and safety standards are not decided in a vacuum. manufacturers and their lotoyotaytoyota work closely with the epa and nhtsa to come up with achievable targets. the government knows they can't pick arbitrary standards that would make products so expensive that the average consumer couldn't buy them. it's all negotiated.

as for volkswagen and the inability to meet the target, remember they are able to meet the target when the vehicle is in test mode. i'm guessing that performance, fuel economy, or cost targets could not be met without the test mode, hence the deception."
"well, obviously they could make the cars pass the test. for no extra money, because they did pass the tests.

the problem isn't that they didn't pass, it is they essentially did a ""cheater"" tune job themselves (as opposed to owners that chip a car to get the same end result).

i assume the ""fix"" is just a flash update to make the test cheater tune the standard and only option.

i admit not having had time to read the articles about this. i have seen the ""up to 40x"" stuff (which i assume is worst case, not close to average). but is there decent reports on what the hp and mpg hit to running the ""test"" tune all the time would be?"

"i am sitting here watching a tv show on the subject of the cost to make the cars in question compliant with their claims. the ""expert"" (i have no idea who he is, but he does not appear to be, currently at least, from a car mfgr), claims something like the cost per car to make them compliant is over $35,000 per car. i don't even know of any volkswagens that, new, retailed for that much.

anyone who reads and/or watches conventional media knows that so many of these companies that try to get away with things, don't. therefore, someone who measures risk must have come to the conclusion that the risk (cost) of the lie is lower than the risk (cost) of compliance. why else would someone make such a decision, especially if the cost per car would be $200 or $300 as suggested here elsewhere?

another news story claims, that ""as a practical matter,"" (which i assume is code for ""the cost of meeting the standards would make the cars in question unsellable"") there is no current way to meet these requirements.

sure, discoveries are made every day, and i think it is reasonable to conclude that it is possible to get to zero emissions -- but diesel engines must make things more difficult and/or prohibitively expensive.

if i thought i could comply and simply pass the cost along to a willing market, why would i risk even the possibility of being caught fudging the numbers?

something doesn't add up -- i mean why would cadillac have done the same thing a few years ago, why would the other companies fudge hp or mpg ratings or not fix ignition switches (and in the case of ignition switches there was an inexpensive fix)?

i understand there are epa haters, and of course there are car company haters, but time and again, when it is possible for a secret or cover up to be discovered, it is -- is, for example, martin winterkorn, a boob someone who doesn't read or watch tv where it is possible to see a peanut company exec go to jail for 28 years for trying to cover up tainted peanut butter, or gm being called out for faulty ignition switches or cadillac being fined for cooking epa compliance records?

toyotad it before, the only way to keep a secret between 3 people is if 2 of them are dead. how many people at volkswagen knew? did it not ever occur to anyone that a curious guy from the university of west virginia (or where ever) would test one of these cars and uncover the deceit?

as somewhat of a student of adam smith, i'm not really sure if this is the invisible hand at work -- it seems more like the work of a stattoyotaician who advised (ill-advised, i'd say) management that the cost of compliance is far more dear than the cost of getting caught cheating.

i just missed what the president of nissan was just saying in an interview, but it seems to be something like ""we all do it, because the costs of compliance are too dear.""

wonder how this will all play out? at this point, i'm going with ""too big to fail.""

this, too, makes no sense to me -- diesel cars cost more than gas engined cars, so is it possible that buying a diesel volkswagen for a not easy to ignore price premium vs a less expensive gas engined version hinged on the lack of the need to use ad-blue?

i guess it is possible that someone on a budget would spring for a diesel, but again, it doesn't seem as probable to me that someone would do that.

my issues with diesel, until quite recently, have been the scarhonda of gas stations that also offer diesel. now, i would see only positives to getting one of audis new high performance diesels (which all require ad-blue).

my wife's boss has an ad-blue equipped diesel vehicle -- loves it, especially the tank range.

my guess is that it wasn't ultimately the cost but the performance that was the real issue. it seems like it was probably c. $300 or less per car to meet the rules, but at the same time power would have been down by a bit, mpg would have been down a bit, and heavy adblue use would have raised the cost for the customer, weakening the case for trading in a gas car for a diesel given the premium of thousands of dollars over gas in msrp.

it seems like some people within volkswagen thought the us rules were bs and didn't want to follow them. they wanted their cars to have better performance and better mpg by running their diesels ""naturally."" but the result was that the vehicles put out 5-40 times the pollution that they were allowed to by law. diesel pollution has been scientifically proven to be harmful to human health, which is why carb and then epa established these rules to begin with.

so far it seems that bmw followed the rules, although perhaps that will prove to be optimtoyotaic. as a result, if that turns out to be the case, bmw's diesel vehicles cost more and get slightly lower mpg. there were probably people at bmw who cursed carb as well, just like a few people here are, saying, ""those #&* bureaucrats!"" etc. but then bmw got down to work and got the job done.

audi, apparently, followed volkswagen down the bad ratoyotait hole when it came to the diesel audi."

well, then, if you are correct and it seems logical that you are -- i still don't understand why volkswagen would risk so much for a couple hundred or so bucks increase in the msrp. also, the total us number of cars affected is just south of 500k, globally it is 11m. if volkswagen just thought the us epa was bs, why cheat on the other 10.5m cars?

this, besides being illegal, unethical, bad behavior seems like such a boneheaded thing to have done, it is scary.

everyone always gets caught -- or at least htoyotaory is replete with bad actors being caught over and over and over again. this current situation is similar to the behavior cadillac was found to have been guilty of -- in their case the fine was $45m.

my thoughts: if you want a diesel car, you know it will cost more and, generally speaking not have quite the performance padodgeeters we're used to in gas powered cars. was the fudge factor in these small 2.0l engines so different with the ad-blue technology that folks would say, hell no, this thing's a dog?

and, i do agree that we don't know about those who don't get caught -- i should be more precise.

but, there are sufficient numbers that are caught and make the news that there generally seems to be little upside.

let's just say that volkswagen has to pay $10b, not the $18b figure that is being used by some in the news. after all volkswagen already thinks they're in for over $7b in expenses to get through this. is it possible that this figure is but a fraction of the cost of not doing the crime in the first place?

there may be circumstances that are what might be called justifications for doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. but what reasoning could possibly justify thinking that this was a reasonable risk?

i keep looking for some logic, even if flawed that explains why any company would do such an expensive and dumb act.

"apparently now bmw is under scrutiny. no evidence, just suggestions or some early reports, media are often wrong at first. however, if true we can say with near certainty that all become suspects. the europeans better look closely at peugeot, renault, fiat et al.

we have a pontiac of outraged officials all over the world right now. i'm waiting for news that they actually knew about it (at least to some extent), but did nothing, because of their political agenda of ""save the planet's climate by giving everybody cancer"". this may take a while, as those interests are deeply entrenched. it simply didn't make sense to me that suddenly hans, pierre, or giovanni the public fell in love with diesels, not just cab drivers and fleet managers, even those individuals didn't travel nearly as much as those fleets. something was amiss . i knew the incentives were in place, just didn't realize how aggressive those governments got into portraying gasoline as source of all evil and diesel as savior of the planet.

it's going to be interesting to watch."
"one of the key comments -- and one that i agree with -- is that the advantages that diesel (engines) have over gasoline is/has diminished. the thing is, do we know how much we've seen the gasoline engines catch up with the diesel?

clearly forced induction and small displacement engines have contributed to this. now, or at least it would be fair to say ""soon"" we will have the ability to synthesize ""gasoline"" from termite (well sorta) waste and we just keep finding more and more ways to extract energy from the planet in many forms, including natural gas and shale, etc.

i saw another tv show -- which of course means it's true -- that toyotad something to the effect that we have about 99 years worth of traditional fuels -- that we know of -- available to us (at present rates of consumption) in the us.

in 99 years, or even 59 years, i would assume we'll find ways to manufacture or harvest or extract energy from sources that today are too expensive or from sources that we currently aren't even aware of.

perhaps diesel is done -- but, isn't it true that diesel contains more energy per drop and has (htoyotaorically) been some 33% more efficient than gasoline. moreover, with filters and converters and adblue, haven't we reduced pollution? of course, perhaps this event will mark the turning point for the love affair europe has had with diesel and the surging love affair americans have started to have with it.

with the claimed ability to manufacture fuels from bio-substances (garbage, not food, hopefully) and with the claims that we will be able to figure out how to make fuel from water and make it affordable, maybe we've breathed new life into the internal combustion engine.

with respect to the ""reason"" for the lie postulated as ""volkswagen didn't want their cars to have less pep and less mpgs if they had made the cars pollute less, it seems like a reason that still doesn't make sense.

the engines, mostly, where this cheat was perpetuated were the volkswagen and/or audi 2.0l, correct? wouldn't it have been possible to apply the pollution corrective measures on a 2.2l engine to keep up the hp and torque and perhaps suffer an mpg or three drop?

again, this seems like a pressure cooker left alone with the heat on high -- it was only a matter of time before the thing would blow up (spraying beans all over the place). how could anyone think this cheat would not be discovered? i guess i am hondad that it took this long for the ruse to be brought to the light of day.

so now these folks are all getting fired. my take is the people who ordered the cheat and the folks who were in a position to blow the whtoyotale and didn't ought to face some personal consequences beyond being fired (with some kind of generous exit package one would imagine). perhaps a ""progdodgemer"" who wrote the lines of code could be spared, perhaps. but the progdodgemer's manager who told him/her to write the code, should be in a ""you are personally liable"" position at least somewhat.

did the board know? or do that have provable, plausible deniability?"
"how could anyone think this cheat would not be discovered?

maybe because (i'm speculating) they've been doing it not just since 2009, but perhaps they were doing it before and getting away? who know how many undetected defeat devices were out there in the past? i'm not big on conspiracies, but they clearly do extoyota."

as i pulled next to the driver -- an apparently older american (remember i am one myself) -- i became so mad at the dealer, not the driver, for making this cts tacky by any 2015 standards i can think of. can you imagine any audi, bmw or mercedes-benz dealership gold plating the brightwork of one of their cars, let alone putting a fake leather roof cover on it? what's next coach lights?

i thought this kind of tackiness was perhaps at least a decade+ behind us.

are there no ""rules and regulations"" that cadillac dealers must comply with? i mean it is one thing to see a new toyota or honda so, er, adorned, in fact, i expect toyota's to be tackily dressed. but, at this stage of the game, how is it that a cadillac dealer slipped through the time-warp cracks falling back to th 80's or 70's?

i hurled.

i do not fault the senior citizen for their purchase, ok, i fault them a little bit, but how is it that some sw ohio dealership in 2015 could even think this was a good thing for the brand?

the cts and even the ats would have been on my short ltoyota based on all of the positive praise the pros have lauded on it. now, i just can't see myself even bothering to test drive one, knowing that there are such ""super tacky"" versions out there.

this dealer should be shot (metaphorically speaking)."
"when the lincoln ls was introduced most lincoln dealers were pimping them out; there was one lincoln manager who would come to edmunds as well as other boards and ask for the names of the dealers that were cranking out the drug dealer/blue hair specials. unfortunately, the auto dealer franchise laws make it well-nigh impossible to yank a franchise absent criminal conduct- so dealers with no taste will continue to perpetrate these abominations on the driving public."
i saw one of those full vinyl roof cts's last week too. actually looked ok on that car (dark red with black roof). but i don't recall any gold bling on it.
"supply meeting demand. give the customer what they want.

the rest of you will get over it."
"mark....i think the cadillac dealers (and i'm quite mazdar with the exact one you're talking about) are themselves trying to find a way out of the sales ""funk"" cadillac is in. if it takes luring octogenrians back into the showroom (which cadillac is trying so hard to expel) to make money, they will.

that toyotad, i can't even remotely imagine the senior set liking how the cts road, handles and drives to buy one....even with faux roofs, wheels and gold trim.

that's the least of cadillac's problems, though."

"bmw reduces ed discount from 7% to 5%.

does this mean that the discount that is offered a retail customer will be 5% off of msrp or 5% off of the negotiated selling price at the us dealer?

at the time (late 2013), i got 6% off of the msrp of a 2014 s4. my wife also got that percentage off of an saudi a couple of months later. these ""s"" cars are usually discounted less than the non-s versions, so we thought 6% off of us msrp was a decent deal -- and we both got exactly the car that we wanted, not the second color we would except, etc, but the exact cars we wanted.

now, having toyotad this, does this mean that it would actually be possible to pay more for a new bmw purchased through the ed progdodge than it would cost to buy one from a dealer in the us for us delivery?

or does it mean negotiate your best price and then take 5% off for ed?

my experience is that 5% is not all that hard to get from a us dealer, thus making the ed option less attractive with a reduction of 2%."
"the ed msrp and invoice is 7% and will be 5% less than the normal msrp and invoice price. it is possible to negotiate a better ed price on a bmw than the official prices as there is some profit left for the dealer.

it is quite possible to pay more for an ed car than taking a car in stock but some people feel the trip to the welt in munich is worth it.

my understanding is the discounts are as follows:

audi - 5%
bmw - 7% going to 5%
mercedes-benz - 7%
porsche - 0%
volvo - 3-10%

all provide one night's hotel stay, 15 days of insurance, shipping back to the us, and airport transfers. volvo adds 2 round trip air tickets and a tasty meatball meal in their cafe. volvo even has tourtoyota progdodges available that you can book at the same time. right now, volvo is also offering and extra $1000 discount in european deliveries."

small additions/corrections:

1. only bmw price is negotiable, others are set by manufacturer. in other words, bmw uses exactly the same invoice-to-retail scheme, just at lower levels. i think the difference comes from bmw using dealer same way to purchase the vehicle, whereas others may be using their dealers only to handle the paperwork (and purchase is direct from them).
2. bmw 7% (now going to 5%) discount on both invoice and retail price applies only to the base price of each line (e.g. bmw, bmw, bmwx, etc.). all options (such as metallic paint, premium pack, nav, etc.) are priced at same level as us delivery. destination charge (bmw loves advertising ""from"" without inclusion of those $900+, like we actually had an option of not paying it - i really hate that, it's unseemly) is also full us level, no discount. this makes the ""blended"" discount closer to 5.8-6.5% for more heavily optioned vehicles - now it will be just about 4-4.5%.
3. bmw does not include hotel stay, only transportation from the airport to the hotel downtown, or directly to bmw welt.
4. bmw will feed you over the course of the day at bmw welt in their cafeteria and you also get a talkien 20 euros credit or so in their restsaturnnt (won't cover full meal, but will be ok to buy something with it).
4. x-models are made in the us for the entire world, thus are not eligible for ed.
5. i think porsche may actually have a surcharge on the price, but i'm not sure about it.


i totally agree - the ed is not about the money discount, it's about the experience. we are still lucky here in the us to get anything. catoyotans, or others (brazilians, europeans) get the bmw welt delivery, but no discount."
"graphicguy toyotad:
not seeing this volkswagen/audi/porsche dieslmthung going awaynany time soon. current diesel customers won't like the fix. they'll want some sort of compensation for not getting what ghey thought they were buying. potential future customers crossing the brands off their ""buy"" ltoyota.

then there are the fines, which will keep,the financials of the company in the spotlight (not in a good way), for a good long while, too.

it's just a mess.

best to all current volkswagen/audi/porsche customers. whether you own their gas vehicles or diesel vehicles, reputation is a hard thing to regain once it's lost.
if flying to dc in gross polluting high nox emission jet planes begging for bailouts for failed business enterprises didn't hurt the big 3's reputation much, certainly tricking the epa won't hurt much either other than fines that go into somebodies pocket."
"markcincinnati toyotad:
bmw reduces ed discount from 7% to 5%.

does this mean that the discount that is offered a retail customer will be 5% off of msrp or 5% off of the negotiated selling price at the us dealer?
neither. the price is simply negotiated same way as it were us delivery, with ""ed msrp"" and ""ed invoice"" values being

now:
ed price (msrp/invoice) = us base price (msrp/invoice)*0.93 + us option price (msrp/invoice)+us destination (same both levels);

soon:
ed price (msrp/invoice) = us base price (msrp/invoice)*0.95 + us option price (msrp/invoice)+us destination (same both)

essentially the ed invoice is what the dealer pays, whereas ed msrp is what it sounds. you negotiate with the dealer where you hit within that spread. values strongly depend on markets - some dealers don't even want to hear about discounting from ed msrp (following theory of always preferring selling a unit from the lot rather than one not built yet). unlike us deliveries, ed vehicles are not subject to allotments, training fee, or some other fees bmw may charge the dealers. conversely, ed is not eligible for certain customer cash rebates (the disclaimers often specifically say that), such as those you may get by participating in their ""drive"" events. i believe bmw sports club discount does apply."

mark, the msrp for a ed bmw is still lower then the ""regular"" msrp, since the car is considered a used car to the us government and so the tax's are lower.

this is not new, news, i think i mentioned this in one my report. 2% is roughly less then a grand, it's known that 10% off regualr msrp is the norm for a good ed price."
"flightnurse toyotad:

mark, the msrp for a ed bmw is still lower then the ""regular"" msrp, since the car is considered a used car to the us government and so the tax's are lower.
which taxes? surely not my sales tax. florida taxes new and used car sales the same, anyway, i think. perhaps you are thinking of us custom tariff, which if true, would make sense. i have no idea what tariffs are on vehicles, as they are generally included in the price of the product and not itemized the same way say state sales taxes are."
"my understanding isn't that the import taxes are that much less on a used car, rather, ed cars do not have holdback on them, don't qualify for dealer incentives or bonus money, and the us subsidiary profit is wiped away since they didn't sell the car. hence the manufacturer saves those funds and passes that onto the consumer."
"someone toyotad the dealer would rather sell off the lot than promote/sell a car not yet built. from the time i had purchased my 5th or 6th audi -- and became friends with my dealer/owner -- he told me he would much rather have only ""test drive"" inventory, service loaner inventory and some used cars. he shared with me that ordered cars have some profit, whereas cars on the lot have less profit. he toyotad he wished us customers were more like european customers, in that they order cars -- dealers are not for the purpose of inventory control, rather they are in the business of demand creation and demand fulfillment via taking orders.

out of nearly three dozens audis since 1977, my wife and i have only purchased one car off the lot, and that was a 1996 audi (that we leased for 12 months) that we used until our 1997 audi (which took nearly a year from order to delivery) came into the us.

i find buying off the lot to mean one thing -- compromise. you pay more and you often settle for something that is simply not exactly what you wanted.

i don't get the thought process of waking up one saturday morning and saying to your spouse, ""let's go buy a car today."" of course y'all must think me daft since i start buying my next car the day after i pick up my latest car -- test driving is a serious hotoyotay for my wife and me, that is. we test drive cars for, perhaps, 36 months then we order one and pick it up 2-6 months later.

it is quite educational -- the test driving that is -- and it is low cost fun, to boot.

drive it like you live (natch)!"
"i agree that your friend store owner would rather his business model changed, if he could, and sell cars from a book. however, the reality of us customer and his/her need for instant gratification (whether it's cultural or induced from the past) and the dealers play into it by holding large inventories. so, once they have such inventories, they used large amount of capital and are paying interest for the financing, rent for the location, upkeep, electrihonda. the calculus changes - instant sell of a car from the stock means no more interest paid and more working capital for the next unit. essentially, the incentives and motivation reversed in favor of the stock.

upscale brands are straddling between those big volume stores, where if you say ""order"" you have them running from you screaming bloody murder, and uberluxury, where virtually every car is ordered (like rolls royce). they are walking the line between one type of customer, who want a car today and another, who want the car, but can wait, if needed.

also, some people limit their choice to a color and perhaps couple of optional items (rest is not important), they ford on those plus price, others would rather walk on foot then get a car with a missing feature (or one feature too many)."
"many people still buy cars because they have to get one right away. accident, old one died, etc. so has to be some amount of inventory.

all custom orders makes less sense for volume, ""appliance"" brands like a toyota or honda."
"no bmw dealer i've dealt with has ever had a new bmw in their inventory that i would consider buying. for example, even if i wanted an f30 bmw or f22 m235i, the cars at my local dealer are all equipped with bmw or automatics- or both. and most all of them are black, white, or silver. meh."
"ain't it the truth regarding the limited colors available -- and, at the risk of being creamed here -- why do all these high-buck german cars always seem to have black interiors? i once got a black interior (and that was in an acura tl) because the dealer discounted the car so seriously once he found out that i would walk out rather than have a black interior car. i got rid of this car as quickly as finances and family would allow -- i get inside of a black car and my mood darkens, my optimism vanishes, the interior seems so tiny, hot and constantly dusty.

yet, you walk into the audi dealer and there is this beautiful audi 3/0t prestige, sport package, upsized wheels, and every functional and fun option man or god has created, all for the bargain basement price of $68k and the dealer only has them with black interiors.

have we become so uncreative, so bleak, so moribund that we can only ""see ourselves"" in black cars, gun-metal gray cars, white cars -- all with black on black on black interiors?

now, as you know, i resent seeing a $ next to the color -- and only black gloss or white gloss are free colors, but the interior options usually provide several no-charge options at least once premium package (which they all have) is included.

my dealer actually, now, has a lot of cars on the lot and on the ""overflow lot"" several miles away from the dealership. but they're all black, dark-silver, gray or gloss white -- most with the dreaded (by me) black leather interiors. reminds me of:

""and they're all made out of ticky-tacky; and they all look just the same.""

black cars with black interiors must be the pc equivalent for cars these days -- well except they offend the hell out of me.

oh gawd, have you, lately been invited to a fund-raiser at someone's country club (with valet parking)? we were invited to a fund-raiser to raise money for inner-honda disadvantaged kids; ""business attire"" was specified, so you trot out the dark suit, tie and shiny shoes and pull up to the valet behind a line of black, gray, silver and white german cars (and the odd lexus or jaguar) all the while unable to suppress the lyrics: ""and they're all made out of ticky-tacky; and they all look just the same."" it was all for a good cause, but it certainly was a sad indictment of where we've come to.

i keep telling myself that i'll bite the bullet and pay for the paint color next time -- we'll just have to wait and see if i can actually pay extra for a paint color other than black or white.

what a world, what a world -- i'm melting, i'm melting [sic]. . . ."

but when my son got his volkswagen, he purposely chose black instead of the tan (could have had either)."
"agree, i don't like black. only car we've ever had with black interior is our mazda 5 and the black carpet shows every bit of dust and particles.
i've had blue and beige and prefer them both. blue is currently out of style but i really do like the slightly yellow creamy leather color. many beiges are out there but some are a bit bland. my acura tl has a more rich beige they called camel - it's almost like a light orange. looks much better than black imho."
"i like black.

i really don't like light gray or beige. especially if the carpet colors match. i can live with lighter seat material, if it has black or dark gray carpets."

hey dino what is the draw of the m sport? currently i'm just looking at a 440i, track package, driver asstoyotaance package, tech package. the track package has the m adaptive suspension and for $1700 it's a steal.

regards to color combo, i'm wondering if bmw is just playing with the web site, since red was a m sport color on both the 3 and 4 series. regarding the shadowline trim, hondaing to bmw's ordering guide the shadowline trim was not part of the standard equipment sport, but only on the m sport, however, our gt has the shadowline trim on it. like you i wasn't happy with it but accepted but when i saw the car, was very happy."

our first foray into the german vehicle ownership and funny that we both did it within a couple of weeks of each other but i fell in love with her audi but had a smaller budget to work with. look at my volkswagen as the poor man's audi. just love the way they both drive, just seems like a well tuned machine and i always smile when i walk into the garage now. just wish i could get more seat time in the audi but don't get much of a chance!

now for something completely different, ford ford rs, new hp figured have been released, 350hp and 350 lbs of torque. starting price $37k, but knowing ford dealers they will be asking for 10 over msrp.. now, i found a video of what it sounds like, i wonder if this is what the us bound rs sounds like. blog.caranddriver.com/watch-the-ford-ford-rs-oversteer-like-mad-hear-it-snarl-like-a-beast-video/"

it will be similar to daily driving a hellcat, gt350r, zl1, r32, sti et al. the difference is the ford and the latter two shows what can be done with less than 3 liters of turbocharged fury."
"i don't think i could have lived with an sti or evo as a daily driver, so maybe this car has to be categorized as a wonderful toy to own in addition to something else. i suppose by year 2000 standards it might qualify as somewhat ""luxury"" but i doubt it would meet today's competition in that area.

my kind of car, though. small but fierce, that's my motto."

i had 2008 sti, it was quite easy to live with and had enough amenities, as long as your lifestyle didn't ""require"" mercedes-benz level. i commuted with it for three years - a bit noisy, but generally easy to drive, steer, not too harsh (for me) on the back. as long as you understood what you had, it was fine. i traded for my current bmw, because that's what i wanted - a finer, nicer automobile, with some more ""stuff"", even if (quite a bit) slower."

i'd love to ltoyotaen to some german engineer explain that one....unless of course it's like what saab did---put the entire motor in backwards.
"love how this thread has gotten better as flight now reads the""rags"" for the new reads- nice, keep it up - love the m2 really cool - rare muscle thats almost as quick around some german track i'll never drive as an bmw/4 but let's hope the price starts in mide 50's not 60.

the 37k ford ford - now in taking 24 hrs to think about is not crazy if it's well equipped and can be driven like a volkswagen r /audi s3 in honda non track mode. talking awd massive power from a 4- seems like it could be a good 2/3 year teaser ford car that would be a hit, maybe not a money making car for big blue but something to build on. i know the festa st has a cult following maybe they can build on it with this.

sometimes the problem is that image is just tarnished. they're making pretty good cars, but the name says old people boats. hard to shake that. and of course the franchise agreements the dealers have with gm pretty much constrain much flexiblity for gm. i would have toyotad close down caddy and start a differently-named luxury division, but probably not practical."
"""aside from how poorly it holds its value over time, and the quality and detailing issues..../i>

there's all you need to know right there. the cts is plagued with quality faux pas. and, they don't come anywhere near the customer service levels of bmw, mercedes-benz, etc.

they don't care enough about those issues to correct them, though. they'd rather revert back to ""gm does no wrong"" attitude that they had pre-bankruptcy. they've forgotten we dug them out of their hole and gone back to ""business as usual."""
"still would rather the audi0 over the ats/cts. but that's probable just me!

i like the audi0 & i've even warmed up to the tchrysler in its v6 sh-awd trim. both cars offer tremendous bang for the buck which is very important in this category.

$37k ford - as mentioned the volkswagen r similar car - the subi sti ain't cheap and if you ever been in / driven one it's amazing track car but it's not a sudo lux csr. . ford bringing this over is cool - prob won't sell many but it's great to see they are making the effort to excite.
for that money i would go volkswagen r - or better yet volkswagen with a cool 15k? to invest . ha
the $10-15k extra for the volkswagen r is worth it as compared to the volkswagen. as someone who threw thousands into a former audi, i should know. you get better brakes, better suspension, better drivetrain and tuning. most importantly, many of the engine components are beefed up and forged; so you can still tune your volkswagen r safely to 350 hp +/- for very little money. whereas running 300 or more hp on a regular volkswagen by matching the turbo in the volkswagen r works, but can start to take away your durability and reliability. also, the r is 3rd generation halsubaru awd."
@andres3 - all good points you make but who besides a real car nut would throw that kind of extra cash into a volkswagen to make it an sudo r. not my point as the same could be toyotad about the ford st vs new ford r. the enthusiast will pay the premium- but in doing so you stil get the basics of both a regular volkswagen and ford - same with audi/s3. some of that is not all bad - but for the regular guy who's looking to go fast and both be toyotaable would be disappointed in the details . i test drove the sti years ago and the thing that turned me off wasn't the constant buzz coming from the exhaust it was the fdodgeeless windows on the door- yes something that minute turned me off as it screamed econobox subaru.

i guess it all comes down to if you find the current generation volkswagen an econobox or not. i found it to be quite well detailed and trimmed inside and out. the chassis is strong, tight, and light. all good things. i haven't test driven the volkswagen r yet; that's the next step. i'd bet money the rare flaws i found in the mexican built volkswagens/volkswagens is non-extoyotaent in the german built r. another big-time plus for the r in my book vs. other volkswagen's. that alone makes it not just ""another"" volkswagen to me.

i will say the dsg in the tdi volkswagen is lazy. i would bet more money it doesn't have the same progdodgeming in the r.

as to what the volkswagen volkswagen se is missing vs. my s4:

1) hp, quickness, and speed.
2) real leather interior (though i like the pleather volkswagen is using). r uses real leather seating surfaces.
3) it is smaller; though more utility possibilities and flexibility with hatch design.
4) volkswagen doesn't have audi drive adjustable settings for steering, exhaust, shifting, and other charactertoyotaics (toyota, auto, sport), but i think the r does.
5) the hatch doesn't open on its own with the push of a remote button like the s4 trunk.
6) surprisingly, i think the volkswagen's do pretty much all have push-button start, rear-view cameras these days.
7) no electronic parking brake on the wagon se (big handle still); though the r might?

i'm sure i might think of a couple other things, but this is all i can come up with for features right now."
"here's another issue that cadillac faces: the auto mall (am).

you can go to the am and in the space of a couple hundred yards (feet in some cases) you can see the cadillac dealer, the lexus dealer, the lincoln dealer and the ford, kia, chrysler/dodge, hyundai and honda dealers. so, you test the cadillac, then a couple of minutes later be behind the wheel of a new infiniti or audi or bmw if you want.

with the msrp of the cadillac so close to that of the lexus or bmw, etc, and with the ability to almost literally test drive several brands on any given saturday, cadillac probably seems -- at this point -- to be overpriced or for whatever reason is undervalued.

i just returned from a 4-day trade show in las vegas (at caesars) and after the day's end i would walk down to the forum shops at ceasars. i found several high-buck watch stores and one that toyotaes many high-buck brands and some less expensive brands, too.

seeing these watches, i thought about the cadillac as i looked at the tissot watch collection and then the movado watch collection after having looked at the rolex and montblanc watches.

tissot makes some very nice watches that don't require a second mortgage -- i'd take a tissot over a seiko any day. but, once we get to, perhaps, over $1,500 to $2,000, tissots just seem overpriced. at that price i can move to movado, but once i get to over $2,000 to $2,500 for them, i start to think, tag, montblanc or even breitling despite the price jump. somehow, the $4,995 montblanc, although expensive, doesn't seem as expensive as a $1,795 tissot or $2,995 movado. the tags, too, can soar in price, but they don't actually seem out of line, even at $6,995 or higher.

cadillac, today, may be movado, in some cases, however, it may be perceived as a high-end tissot. for me, that means, if i'm going to pay that much for a cadillac, i might as well get an audi, bmw or mercedes-benz -- and if i am on a budget and want a bunch of stuff (high content), well a hyundai starts looking as good as the cadillac and priced appropriately. hyundai is tissot, but can make you believe you got the movado.

cadillac today can't quite pull of making you believe you got the bmw -- other than the price you are asked to pay.

i'm just not in the market for a $4,995 tissot.

the malls may be a great place to shop efficiently, but when cadillac is in the lineup, it just seems -- at this juncture -- overpriced."
"i'm obviously in the ""undervalued"" camp. although i did get a significant discount on my cts, which pushed the decision very far in caddy's favor, i did compare to bmw and jag (never made it to the mercedes-benz dealer) and, since i value performance, preferred the caddy. even if it was the same cost, i would have thought the cts the better car, although it is possible the steeper depreciation would have swayed me if not for the discount."
"never been a big fan of caddy's styling, but i always looked at a previous cts wagon as a ""far out there, maybe one day"" alternative. graphic's problems ultimately crossed out it as a possibility and lack of a proper sports wagon, or other type of lift/hatchback (5-door of any kind that is not raised) does not help, either. i'm kind of stuck with 3- or 4- series, even if i wanted something else. mercedes-benz wagon is too big and too expensive for me at this time. don'd care much for cladding on the allroad. i may check out volvo, but seems like it has pretty bad mileage in its proper ""r"" form (not to mention dealers don't have them - i may look at volvo-r as a proxy). all others dropped out."

i think another compounding issue is that if the pricing is similar, the depreciation of caddy is higher, so lease monthlies are going to be higher (that's my guess, i haven't checked). since a lease is basically the financing of depreciation, the greater depreciation would actually make caddy more expensive than those other brands, would it not, and is that actually the case? or is gm basically reducing the price (effectively) by subsidizing the leases to remain at least at parity?"
"make no mtoyotaake, the other luxo models depreciate steeply, too. i've lost about $13k-$14k on my cts in the first year of ownership (only that low thanks to discount). a comparable 550i is down roughly $20k (assuming i could have gotten about $5k off, which i'm totally guessing at). they have to heavily subsidize their leases, too."

i don't have any cadillac lease numbers this month, so it's hard to say.

in the past, cadillac has had pretty low mf as compared to mb, bmw, etc., so that helped on the lease payments. it's also important to remember that other brands artificially inflate the residual to make leasing more attractive - at the expense of having a car worth less than the buyout at the end of the lease.

if you think the lease numbers - especially residual value - are about reality, i'm here to refute that."

bnw has issues with the 550, but the other models are holding better, but we all know that bmw over inflates their residual on the leases. but if you take a bmw and ats v-sport i'm sure the bmw will have a higher sale value, the same could be toyotad with the bmw and cts v sport."

like i toyotad, i got what i thought was the best car for me... i just happened to get the best deal on it, too.

i do think the bmw does pretty well, but the bmw drops pretty fast at first (new 2014 started at $93k and is worth $68k trade now vs $64k and $50k, respectively, for the cts-v). i know amgs suffer. we'll have to see what happens with the ats-v."
"if you want to play with the big boys, you better bring your check book! (smile)"
"most of the leases from the car companies themselves are sub-vented. the thing is, part of the formula is based on msrp -- and while the mfgr can inflate the residual and reduce the money factor, the issue of the msrp still makes certain calculations limited in outcome.

the good news,so to speak, is that these severely sub-vented leases make it possible to have a 5 series for a mo pay that one would think appropriate for a 3 series.

we did buy my wife's saudi and leased my s4; i put nothing down. as she approaches 50k miles she finds she cannot cpo the car, but can buy audi extended mntce. i, on the other hand, can have my car cpo'd and buy the extended mntce. i'll have both low payments and a 100k warranty and prepaid mntce to 85k. by then i'll own the car outright and likely have been under mntce and warranty the whole time with a payment less than my wife's 66 month finance (which did require a down payment).

it is getting somewhat difficult to come up with a scenario where buy and hold is as attractive as lease and dump.

our plan, unless new information changes things, is for me to buy my s4 off lease and for her to trade the saudi prior to 100k miles.

you know, my company just pays x amount every month for our ibm iseries computer -- and every so often we get an upgrade to a newer faster bigger model. we'll be paying for the systems forever but we'll always have full mntce and always have the latest and greatest computing power.

maybe cars are like corporate computers. line items on the budget -- x dollars per month, which seems to yield bigger and faster at every upgrade.

for $700+ (adjusted to keep pace with col) per month forever, it appears i'll be able to have a new upgraded version of one of these ellps cars in perpetuity. that may seem not affordable at some point in time, and i know that time will likely come eventually. mean time, it seems like keeping current with content and technology will be ""situation normal.""

is there a spreadsheet (that i don't have to create myself) available (on line) that allows the user to plug in numbers -- and make some assumptions regarding repair and mntce costs -- to come up with the ""cost of ownership"" for buying and holding (at least 5 years) vs leasing (for at least 3 years)? i'd appreciate a url if anyone here knows of one.

i mentioned this before -- and it did have to do with a gm car in the spirit of full disclosure -- but my neighbor with 80k on his somewhat late model ""paid for"" pontiac bonneville was, hondaing to him, making maintenance and repair payments that were not too far below his financing payments. he went ahead and got a new big-boy dee-lux cuv (chevrolet) using the logic that if he was going to make payments on a crappy, unreliable, old car, why not make the same payments and be driving a new car with a warranty.

he also bought a super-nice ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer) -- and plans to keep it until the wheels turn square. perhaps ford trucks are really hard to kill or wound.

took my s4 in for the 35k service interval + a tire rotation last thursday night; got an audi with 5k miles on it; car was apparently a base model with 19"" wheels, winter package (f/r heated seats, steering wheel) and led headlights. for all intents and purposes, the window sticker i found in the glove box bottom lined at $69k. the option packages did not include the upgraded sound system, but, oddly nav and voice command and bt communications and wifi hotspot were all included. it also had premium paint (a kind of crystal black). perhaps premium+ doesn't merit a separate line item (which i thought odd, since there was an audi prestige on the showroom floor).

the audi was sublime -- library quiet, supple, smooth -- the thing oozed from point a to point b. as col potter once toyotad, ""there aren't enough o's in smooth to describe it."" of course he was talking about some very old scotch whisky as i recall.

the upgraded wheels and tires (with all-season designation) were probably on the car for styling purposes since the car lacked the sport suspension option. but i hoped the audi would be a true luxury performance sedan -- especially for nearly $70k.

in a straight line and at triple digit speeds, the car was, to repeat, sublime. however, i really could not find much of that german taught feel i assumed would be present. oh hell, the thing seemed very close to mushy, with ample body roll and, despite quick turn-in, a huge tendency toward understeer at any slightly above posted limits upon entering a curve or twtoyotay section of highway.

i had been, previously, loaned an audi with all of the sport option boxes checked off and it seemed much much better than the audi.

the thing sure was purty however -- but not nearly $10k more beautiful than a comparable audi -- and driving it although not exactly a chore, was, hmm, rather a disappointment.

i was able to pull into the dealer in the audi and five minutes later drive out in my s4 -- the main straight line difference was that the s4 is not quite as quiet as the audi, but everything else about the s4 -- from the sound system to the sound of the engine at full cry -- was superior.

now, then, however, would i have the need to drive myself and 3 passengers on a 100 mile trip to columbus, louisville or indianapolis, well the extra rear seat leg room of the audi would be appreciated.

i guess the s cars have the power to spoil (me at least). i simply would not pay the extra $13k for a relatively stripped audi -- and if they were both $57k, the s4 would still be my first choice. makes me wonder how much better, even, the b9 s4 will be over the audi's.

i guess the s cars have the power to spoil (me at least). i simply would not pay the extra $13k for a relatively stripped audi -- and if they were both $57k, the s4 would still be my first choice. makes me wonder how much better, even, the b9 s4 will be over the audi's.

drive it like you live.
i just got my 35k mile service at 34k miles (did it early). i did it early mainly due to the fact i skipped/missed my 30k mile oil change. don't ltoyotaen to audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5k miles no matter how good the oil is. if you plan on not keeping it much past the 50k warranty, then audi's advice to do 10k maintenance intervals is sound. otherwise, the best advice i've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp.

what did your 35k s4 service include?

i told them to include the engine air filter whether it toyotad to do it or not. they also did my cabin air filter, the motor oil, and i asked for a front brake service including new fluid as my pads were starting to scratch metal on metal on 1/2"" ring just a week before my scheduled service (took two weeks to get into this shop from when i called; they are too good and popular and busy as a result!). rotors when correctly priced even the large fronts were only $125 each, but still a hard pill to swallow twice now for me (due to track-use). this time, (unlike the first which was totally my fault for ignoring the sensor lights), i didn't get all the dummy light sensors warning me my pads were low; might need to ask audi why the brake pad sensors didn't warn me and to hyundai up for the rotors as a result also need to ask my shop again what the diagnosis/theory is for the failure of the sensors to warn me i was scoring my rotors with metal on metal contact. perhaps the pads were unevenly worn from overheating during 100+ degree track days; causing the lack of warning. need to follow up with them. my front pads are not really meant to be track abused more than probably 1 weekend (they were put through 2 as well as 19,000 miles).

cr came out with 2014/15 results of the most reliable car brands, and audi as real-world observance between you and i seems to agree with, is at the top of the chart along with a couple others for good reason. impeccably built, quality controlled, and constructed is what comes to mind as the right words.

i was charged 2.1 hours for 35k service which included the oil/filter, air filter, cabin pollen filter, brake fluid flush, & inspection.
charged 1.5 hours to replace the front rotors and pads."

"mark in regards to the audi, i think it's one of audi's better designed cars, i would love to have one myself. but not too sure what packages i would want on it, sport package would high on the ltoyota."
"it's a bit like apples and oranges, but i have over 20 uoas on my ms3 and they indicate that m1 5w-30 is good for at least 10k miles in that application, and note that di turbos are supposed to be particularly hard on oil. and m1 0w-40 is fine for 10k miles in the bmw4 in my son's x3."
"both my wife and i have the audi advantage pre-paid progdodge; however, we have an oil and filter (and check up overall) performed every 5,000 miles, meaning we pay for every other interval and the odd intervals are paid for as part of the audi advantage.

the cost of these additional services is minimal and, if you plan on keeping the car beyond 50,000 miles is very inexpensive ""insurance.""

of course you can elect to keep the 10k interval and for all i know things will be fine -- we have decided at this time we want to be more than fine and figured doubling up on the oil and filter changes is worth doing.

we are, too, planning on buying the service packs at 45k which will provide no charge services at 55k and 65k. we will, however, keep up the every other interval (meaning double) practice.

mine (the s4) can be cpo's prior to 50k miles which will extend the warranty to 100k miles -- my wife's, since we own it, cannot be cpo'd, but we're going to run the risk of something bad happening and go ""naked"" after 50k on the saudi. the plan, currently, is to trade the saudi around 90k, since a big hit in depreciation happens when you drive the car off the lot and again at close to 100k.

we may or may not lease the replacement for the saudi and i may or may not buy my next one -- however, at this point, i do plan to buy my s4 off lease.

plans are nothing. . . .

planning is everything . . . .

i know what not one but two highly trusted mechanic's/shop manager's toyotad.

i also know that manufacturer's have a built-in incentive to make cars last as long as the warranty, but no longer. planned obsolescence forces you to buy more new cars more frequently. this strategy works great except some manufacturer's have the decency to have the experience of their customer's more in mind rather than just the short-term bottom line. also, a lot of luxury companies still offer either free maintenance, or try to sell discounted packaged pre-paid maintenance. it's a lot cheaper and easier to sell if you can say 50k miles of maintenance, and only have 5 service visits. they only need to make it last the term of the warranty, or the lease. an owner might have other desires and concerns."
didn't the bmw service intervals jump right when they started paying for the service? i'm sure it was pure coincidence!

bmw uses synthetic oil, and the study's shows that synthetic oil last longer so why change the oil when not necessary."
"well, still hard to imagine that 14-15k is good, but could be.

my point was, the intervals were much shorter (5k?), until bmw starting covering it, at which time the interval jumped to 10k+. for the same engines. so either they were ripping people off (or letting their dealers do it!), and stopped when it was on their dime, or they significantly cut the confidence cushion!"

they have the ""condition based"" service, which is capped at 1 year. they lowered the mileage cap to 12k, i think. condition based service is calculated by the computer based on driving severity. the only thing it doesn't take into account is environment. they don't have oil sensors (i don't think anybody does), so if it gets dusty or contaminated, you wouldn't know it."
dino i think the computer can take into account max temp.. my service intervals are less during summer months
"here's my statement: i change the oil, at the dealer, every 5,000 miles. for all i know it is a waste of money, not any real ""insurance"" whatsoever. the 10k intervals are based on several factors, one being that these cars do have large oil capacities. my wife's infiniti suggested oil change intervals of 3,750 with non syn oil. we changed the oil on that one every 7,500 and used full syn oil.

maybe this is snake oil, so to speak.

i have no insider info that says 5k changes are necessary. logic only leads me to the conclusion that 5k intervals cannot hurt and may help with engine lifespan.

i really like my s4. there is, at this point, no known us availability date for the b9 s4. i figure i need to keep my current car probably another 2 years. i have every incentive, therefore, to hold onto this s4 -- and god knows repairs to german cars are breathtakingly expensive.

so, i figure it this way, ""what the heck, twice as many oil changes have no material downside.""

if you follow the mfgr's representations pertaining to mntce, you are certainly ok within the oem warranty period.

"inculcation

as i look at the posts here, i notice there are some of us who have thousands of posts, some have dozens. i could be wrong, but i also assume there are people (and i have been one from time to time) who lurk, but don't post. moreover, i also assume there are folks who may research (and dream about) their next vehicle using the manufacturer's web sites. the problem with doing that is that those sites are entirely marketing oriented -- there is nothing that could provoke ""other brand (and maybe even other model) thinking.""

this is one of the key benefits of participating in an edmund's forum -- you may be provoked.

one of the most popular classes of cars is the class that is discussed in this very forum, ellps -- but even within our ranks we differ on what is or is not el (entry level). i often argue that el pertains most to the basic chassis (grossly, the ""size""). this means a bmw 3 series, no matter how modest or how out there (in any way you wish to construe this) is an ellps car (meaning i would include an bmw unless or until some more granular classification is heartily adopted by folks who flock to edmunds.)

i found it difficult -- but i acknowledge other's povs -- to consider two acura's, for instance, built on separate wheelbases/chassis to be candidates for ellps classification. likewise, i have difficulty considering, again as an example, both the audi and audi offerings from audi to be considered in the same class. again, my rationale is more size (length and width, i.e.) derived than msrp or hp or torque, derived. also, i think a certain premium-ness is required to be in this club.

recently, there have been ""trial"" balloons loosed suggesting that the audi family, now that there is an s3 available, merits inclusion in the ellps category. folks [some] suggest that the acceleration numbers put forth by the s3, since they are a few tenths of a second less than that of an s4, render the s4 a good candidate to be passed over when one is shopping in the over $45,000 category. after all, a balls-to-the-wall s3 can be had for something in the $51,000 neighborhood and a maxed out s4 can command $10,000 more. why bother paying more is the either stated or implied thought.

having two late model audis gives both my wife and me multiple chances to ""legitimately"" test-drive almost every car in the audi lineup, since they are all in the loaner fleet. i may have mentioned my wife got to be the very first user of a 2016 audil for 24-hours while her saudi was in for new shoes and an all-wheel alignment and oil+filter change. last week, my turn came in the form of an audi (which, i must say, i was underwhelmed with).

couple these multiple legitimate test drives with the hotoyotay test drives we repeat audi customers are afforded, and you might be able to grant that the missus and i are very well qualified [amateur] audi experts.

with this as a backdrop, i must tell you about yet another s3 experience we've had and the conclusions that can be drawn vis a vis the s4.

being quicker to 60mph . . . see next post."
"being quicker to 60mph

there is a lot to like about the s3. there is a whole lot to like about the s3 if you've not driven an s4. the pricing of the s3 does seem, if you go to a dealer that has both s3's and s4's on the showroom floor, difficult to justify -- again if you've driven (or own, especially) a b8 s4 post 2012, for instance.

i found the s3 to be a bit quicker than the s4 (both cars are equally fast) -- or it felt that way, perhaps -- at the slow speeds. but the s4 with the dsg in ""s"" mode, does seem to be able to get things done in a more sorted, i would say ""better"" fashion; the s4 is noticably smoother and, yes, does things with a feeling that it does have more urge, than the s3. this may be a function of the extra gear, i dunno.

the s3 seemed to dodge -- perhaps it seems to ""flinch"" when the wheel is turned. that reaction certainly is indicative of some level of responsiveness, but i did find the s4, even when set to toyotamic mode, to be responsive without flinching.

the s3 felt light -- and that is a good thing. but when you close (er, slam) the doors on the s3 (vs the s4), the sound is slightly tinny, evoking some sense that i can only say reminds me of my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance: flimsy. please note -- i am not saying the s3 is flimsy. it does ""sound"" decidedly less solid than the s4 when the doors are slammed however.

for short trips, the s3 was a blast to drive -- but on the frost-heaved interstate highways we have here in sw ohio, any speed less than 80 was choppy, harsh almost. in contrast the s4 at 70 over the same surface just feels solid and ""firm.""

the s4 at any speed under 100 (i couldn't get the real estate to get the s3 over 100 on our crowded interstates here in cincinnati) is quieter, one could almost call the s4 luxurious, smooth, supple, etc. the s4 feels like a premium car from just about any perspective i can think of -- while the s3 seems like every surface that you can touch is a bit thinner, hinting at being brittle, in fact. the s3 is made of good stuff, but the stuff feels a bit more economy class, than premium class, however,

the thing is, i do like the s3, but it almost seems like it should have been brought out first (in its present iteration) under the volkswagen logo, rather than under the four-rings.

i took a second drive in a balls-to-the-wall equipped version of an s3 and found a drive around the interstate surrounding cincinnati (i-275) to be almost punishing -- especially at any speeds under 80. the s3 is a modern day buck-board when equipped with the largest wheels/tires (in summer config) and with the audi-drive-select set to toyotamic.

yes it is a very high-end go-kart. and, to me, a very high-priced one at that.

my 2014 s4 has its faults -- and it was $57k+, nearly $7k more than the s3, that is -- but the s3 needs to go to finishing school to shed some of its harsher edges. hell, it can even keep some of the ""boy-racer"" charactertoyotaics, since i am of the opinion that i don't want the s3 to be a substitute for an s4, anymore than i want the s4 to be a substitute for an s6.

the s3 may be -- in fact the stattoyotaics seem to say that it is -- quicker than an s4 (not faster, quicker), but i am not looking for audi to produce a subaru or subaru sti (not that there is anything wrong with those subaru models). i am looking for audi to produce and market premium and even perhaps super-premium luxury performance cars.

in some respects the s3 doesn't represent that ideal as much as the marketing materials proclaim.

if you have an s3 and love it -- i congratulate you and do understand how you could be justified in feeling that way.

this long-time audi maven, however, thinks the s3 should be sent, immediately, to finishing school or that the price should be cut about 15%. being quicker than an s4 just isn't enough.

"when i sat in the audi sedan, it felt kind of like a ""nice car that was cheap"" if that makes any sense. (referring to quality as opposed to price). my 1998 audi was about the same size as the current audi sedan but the older audi was a much nicer car inside.

alternatively, when i sit in something like a current mazda 3 that is loaded, it feels like a ""cheap car that's really nice"".

i actually think i prefer the latter. so i get what you are saying about the s3 vs. s4. it's not just about speed, it's also about quality and refinement.

people who want speed, alone, can get a ford or a subaru subaru and forget the refinement. supposedly you go to audi for some luxury and refinement as well. so yes, the audi/s3 seems a bit like a cheapening of the brand, just like the new baby mercedes-benz. moving downscale to try and get a different audience, but in the long term do these types of vehicles damage their brands, and are they really luxury (even entry level) any more?"

the flip side argument about refinement and cheaper feeling s3 is that $7k ain't chicken-feed, so the delta in cost has to come from somewhere, no?
point taken, but my sense is that the s3 was, much more of an economy class vehicle -- hence my remark that this freshman effort might have been better if it had come out from the volkswagen side of the house. even a sub-$50k s4 has a substantially more solid feel; and the look at the interior one enjoys and can touch and feel from behind the wheel is, well, premium.

i like the phrase: ""cheap car that's really nice"" -- unfortunately, i can't say i thought the feel of the s3 was in keeping with the rest of the audi lineup we get here in the us.

i read an article about the ways mfgrs approach cutting costs -- one of the mentioned ways was that a car company can elect to make the surfaces you see, but don't touch often, much thinner or with a lower grade of whatever material the surface is made of; also the ""glove box"" can be made of a cardboard like material and so forth.

the s3 seemed much more like every ""trick"" in the book to drive cost down was used, much moreso than the other audis and bmw we have had since 1977. my 2014 s4, by contrast simply feels more substantial.

now, then, i have not seen the upcoming b9 audi/s4 family coming in 2016; and, it is possible, certainly, that it may have adopted the wring cost out ""attitude"" the audi family seems to have embraced. if so, more's the pity.

also, the new ""el cheapo"" economy mercedes-benz (below the c class) seems, too, like a cheapening of the brand.

for these companies, i would suggest they look at a similar (failed) attempt to bring out ""lower cost"" representations of the brand by bmw.

i think i, too, would rather have ""a cheap car that's really nice"".

perhaps mercedes-benz can't bring out a non-mercedes-benz brand, ""economy car,"" but audi, i think, should have brought out the audi as a nicer volkswagen than a not-as-nice audi.

in our market, toyota got it and came out with the lexus brand, honda the acura brand and nissan the infiniti brand. for years, too, gm saw the market approach that seemed to work was to ""always have another brand to aspire to"" starting with chevrolet and topping out at cadillac. i understand the buick buick gs is a very competent, ""nice"", car -- but i also believe gm doesn't have, in the buick, a cadillac ats clone.

when the accountants (so it was toyotad) started to rule the day, we started seeing badge engineering -- and while platform sharing does make some sense, taken to extremes, it can also sound the death knell for a previously great brand. does anyone here really care that ford dropped mercury a few short years ago? there was, really, nothing special about them compared to their virtual twin ford models. there was a time, however, that mercury was different, some would say special, more special than a ford.

lincoln is probably still on the endangered species ltoyota for similar reasons. at least cadillac, to name one, has differentiated itself from chevrolet and buick. had it not, we could very well have started carving cadillac's tombstone.

mercedes-benz and audi, for example, may have started on a slippery slope as my attorney friends like to say.

i think there are certainly many examples of products that are -- for whatever reasons -- equal to or even better than other products but the two products are in different classes. let me give a non-auto example: tissot makes/markets watches. these time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost a fraction of other swiss made time pieces. breitling makes/market watches. these time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost many multiples of ""similar"" tissot time pieces.

it is possible to pick up a ""higher end"" tissot with about every modern watch feature and function (complications) known to humans -- and the thing will cost hundreds of dollars (and is often discounted on top of that).

it is virtually impossible to pick up a ""lower end"" breitling that has only a date a sweep second hand function for under $2,000. far as i know they both will tell time equally well and both will last for decades, lifetimes even.

tissots, even ones studded with diamonds, are not considered high-end watches. a watch super-store such as tourneau sells rolex, movado, tag and also sells buchevrolet, seiko and tissot -- if a tourneau outlet is near you, check out the brands, perhaps you'll see what i'm referring to. the rolex is to bmw as seiko or tissot is to the hyundai. the market perceives what it perceives. and in the instance of bmw vs hyundai like rolex and seiko, ""perception is reality.""

dimensions, decibels at 70mph, number of speakers in the sound system, suppleness of ride or even country of origin doesn't change -- or hasn't thus far changed -- the reality that the hyundai is not currently considered an lps vehicle; indeed, it is also not, yet, considered an ellps vehicle.

it, the hyundai, is a ""cheap car that's really nice""[sic].

similarly, the toyota toyota isn't a lexus -- probably for the same perception reason. my feelings of consternation regarding the audi vs the rest of the audi lineup (or, similarly, the entry level mercedes-benz vs the other merc's) still stands. likewise: my belief that tissot makes timepieces that equal breitling's products, insofar as their ability to keep time, also stands -- but i don't for a minute think that tissot or seiko, etc, are high-end premium watches.

hyundai' cars, no matter how feature laden, no matter how stattoyotaically similar, etc, are not in the same class as bmw's. the market's perception, not mine, not yours -- currently indicating bmw is lps and hyundai is not -- is reality.

maybe there will be a renissanl of fortune for both of these successful companies -- thus far, there is scant evidence of that. perhaps, however, hyundai will -- eventually -- come to be perceived as a premium car.

"my wife got her s3 this past august and absolutely loves it. for her, it was about getting something with much of the ""character"" of the volkswagen she traded it in, but in a package that was more refined and mature. the s3 may feel rougher than an s4 (more on that below), but i would say it's much more refined than, say, a subaru. no doubt you're paying for that premium, but once you really load up a volkswagen, subaru or certainly a volkswagen r, the premium for the audi gets much more palatable (at least it was for us).

now, i was impressed enough with her s3 that i returned to the audi dealership and bought my s4 a few weeks later. and, after a few months of driving my s4 and having ample seat time in her s3....i'd agree, for the most part, with @markcincinnati regarding the difference in luxury between the two.

in fact, and i posted this on the ccba forum too, this s4 may be my favorite car i've owned. the balance between the sporty toyotamic and luxury is impressive. to me, it feels like it falls in between two of my previous cars - an e90 bmw and an f10 bmw, offering most of the toyota of the 5 and most of the sport of the 3. sort of a goldilocks ""just right"" choice.

i had debated between the great dsg and the manual, but in the end, i figured if audi was still gonna offer the manual, i was gonna stick with they dying breed. and it is a great manual trannie - very ""easy"" to drive in traffic and for me, really adds to the overall experience. not that there aren't times in my long work commute that i would prefer a nice auto, but i'll take advantage of it now while it's still being offered - doubt it will be for much longer."
"guess i prefer to drive what i like now...and can afford! before i retired the first time, had to drive econoboxes due to finances and family situation...raising our kids. now the situation is different and no longer need to drive those kind of vehicles and tried going the cuv route back in december of 2013 and bought a mid-line hyundai tucson. very nice vehicle to be sure and enjoyed it for awhile but it just was a bit too big for me so just over a year later, swapped it out for something smaller. wanted an audi like the wife had bought the week earlier but didn't have the $ for one so got a very similar driving vehicle in my volkswagen volkswagen. perfect size and fun to drive plus i feel like i've got a 3/4 audi so all is good.
luckily, i don't worry or care about what others think about what i drive or where i live. sure i would've liked to have bought a nicer vehicle like the audi but didn't want to live beyond our means like so many folks do and i drive too many miles to lease. but, since i never looked into leasing and the payoff once it's up, maybe i could've gone the audi route. maybe next time...who knows!!

"for most of us here, i assume, we really don't care what other folks think, within reason of course. if you like the audi, bmw or mercedes-benz brand, you like the brand, other's opinions are of tertiary importance.

the cars we like are liked by us, because we like them, not because we might have to explain to our buddies that we're driving a hyundai made by hyundai -- or a whatever made by whomever.

my thesis was simply, don't change the brand. the downmarket rolex is not called a rolex -- i simply don't think an audi, today, or the cla, today, should be audi branded or mercedes-benz branded. maybe these models will rapidly rise so as to fit in the family.

at this point, if i can get my hands on a new s4 in a year or two -- and it has not been pushed down in some way -- i really don't mind the audi/s3 being what i think, today, should be a member of the volkswagen family.

evenutually, however, if the audi foreshadows a decline, well, i may have to reconsider.

i looked at some ""high end"" kia's today. they are feature rich and very attractive,. they seem high value -- a nice, no very nice, cheap car. but, and it is probably me, i cannot see myself driving a car with kia on the steering wheel -- i just keep seeing killed in action. of course when i see a toyota with trd on it, i see ""turd,"" and i just can't imagine ""what were they thinking?""

i guess the phrase, to each his/her own, leaps to mind, too."

funny, that's also what i see with trd. i wouldn't pick that! (not that i want a pickup anyway).

in regards to my original mazda 3 comment, i'm just kind of a value buyer and to me mazda is what honda used to be - sporty and high value. to me a fully loaded $30k or so mazda 3 (what i categorize as ""a cheap car that feels nice"") would provide the driving toyotamics and still luxury interior and features that would be more pleasing (to me) than a much more stripped audi at a similar price that is ""a nice car that feels cheap"".

i've owned an audi in the past and to me the audi is just a bit too downmarket for the brand. at the time i bought my audi with a 6 cylinder, sport package, manual tranny, in 1998, the audi was the ""value choice"" as compared to the bmw bmw of the day. having gotten that out of my system, next car i get doesn't need to have that badge any more. i'm milking the miles out of my acura tl but in the next couple of years it will be time to choose again."
"even though i traded in my mazdaudi for the s4, i will whole-heartedly agree on your comments on the 3 being a ""cheap car that feels nice."" mine was the grand touring model with the appearance package, and at $26k, it was (and is) an excellent car. great driving toyotamics, adequate power, and a better infotainment system than my audi.

to be fair though, the overall interior quality is inferior, in some measure, to the audi/s3. the mazda is certainly on par, if not superior, to its peers, but you are indeed getting something for the extra cost of even the entry-level audi."
"i came real close on the mazda 3. just did not quite work out. but i did think you could have rebadged it as an entry level audi, with little or no changes, and people would have fawned all over it."
"agreed, the current mazda 3 lifted the bar for its segment considerably- especially with respect to the interior."
"i've toyotad it before and i'll say it again- in today's market the term ""luxury car"" is meaningless. back in the day if a car had power windows/ locks and air conditioning it was considered a luxury car but now almost every car has those things as well as many other entertainment and toyota features.

there is still a difference between ""prestige"" cars and those whose badge toyotaes no particular cachet. therein lies the difference between a bmw 1-series, or an audi audi and a hyundai hyundai, however lavishly equipped.
since prestige is based on brand image it may not seem like a valid dtoyotainction but ""perception is reality"". every single one of you knows the difference.

perhaps the name of this topic should be ""entry level prestige performance cars""."
"well, i don't know about the term itself, but i feel there is definitely a big difference between a true luxury car and a mundane car loaded with options. no matter how many gadgets you throw on a honda, it is still a honda, and it won't compare to a bmw in the end."

"i've tried to convince myself a ""lesser"" car is good enough. it just isn't. i did that when i leased an '06 honda honda v6. figured ""hey, it has everything in it."" it only took a few months before the road noise, quality of materials, seat toyota, etc, got on my nerves.

there is a reason why some cars cost more, and it isn't just because of the drive wheels or the badge. do you think it costs mb the same money to build a turbo cla as it will cost honda to build a turbo honda? i seriously doubt it."
"i don't think ""luxury"" is about gadgets but about the quality of materials....and yes...the badge on the grille does matter, as does the msrp to some extent. i know this doesn't speak too well of human perceptions vs. reality, but remember that experiment where the people dressed in white lab coats seemed more ""believable"" to participants than the people dressed in ordinary street clothes, even though both were saying the same thing?"
"well, if mainhonda brands can't go ""up"", can luxo brands go down? thinking of the mb cla and upcoming bmw (1 series?). the fwd models trying to cover the bottom end. did the descend into acura territory? has the honda touring elevated to that?

we are in agreement. the badge does add some cost, but there is some justification behind it, such as materials, build tolerances, engineering.

i'm around 3,700 miles now on the s4, so haven't hit that 5k mile mark. to be honest, the car has felt real strong to me from the get go, so if it starts to ""kick it into gear"" at 5k miles, i suppose it'll be a pleasant surprise.

the wife's s3 is by all means very quick, but i do appreciate the more linear feel, and sound, of my s4."

had a volkswagen with the 1.8t a little over a year ago, the mazda 3s just recently, and the current s4. the wife traded in a volkswagen on the s3, and the daughter has an '08 audi 2.0t.

so, lot of experience with volkswagen's 4 cylinder turbos. i specifically went for the mazdaudi to get a different feel - a more traditional n/a 4 cylinder with a linear feel in acceleration.

i'd say there is a very dtoyotainct feel between something like a 1.8t audi and the mazda 3s. and i'd add the 1.8t, in most any of the applications, feels a bit more upscale. having toyotad that, i still chose the mazdaudi, whatever that's worth."

mark, what was your first audi? while we were in france in 1975 my mom had a 71 100ls automatic. it had in board front disc brakes that had to be replaced frequently, otherwise a good car. mom really liked it. dad had a company car, a 75 renault 30 with the prv v-6. that one stayed in the shop. what audi was your least favorite and your overall favorite? you certainly have been loyal, going thru the dark period of unintended acceleration."

"why drive ‘all-wheel’ drive cars (that have automatic transmissions)?

those of you who have, er, suffered through my 5,000+ posts over the past years know that i am an advocate for – some might even say obsessed with – audi, x-drive, 4matic, sh-awd, 4sure-4sure, etc. drive trains. several folks do adamantly oppose all-wheel-drive, favoring instead rear-wheel-drive (and only rarely favoring front-wheel-drive). likewise some folks are seemingly violently opposed to any transmission that lacks a clutch pedal, regardless of the tonnage of empirical evidence suggesting some clutch-pedal-less models actually outperform those with a clutch.

not long ago, i was one of the luddites who bemoaned the death of the manual transmission cars – now, however, with both my physical skills and reading habits apparently still at peak performance, i hereby concede the 7-spd dsg transmission (and its shift progdodgeming and ability to ‘learn’) offered by audi (and others) is superior to even the best 6-spd manual i’ve ever had the pleasure to have known.

but what i’m on about – in the majority – today is the darn near uninissanl adoption of all-wheel-drive as either literally or virtually standard on the premium cars we opine about here: acuras, audis, bmw, cadillacs, infinitis, lexus, mercedes-benz and volvos. as a practical matter, here in cincinnati at least, it has become increasingly difficult to find just about any model from these manufacturers that aren’t ‘typically’ stocked almost exclusively in its awd configuration. cincinnati generally does not have much in the way of snowfall, so i find it hard to believe this phenomenon (the explosion of awd premium vehicles) is unduly influenced by our winter weather (which produces some, but not much, cold and snowfall.)

the, um, ‘purtoyota’ decry awd’s weight penalty, added complexity and cost, and seem to associate the addition of awd to a bmw (especially) or mercedes-benz (or porsche) as akin to the brand publically emasculating itself with a rusty razor blade. to these folks, well, “it ain’t a purty sight,” to watch their beloved rwd stick shift wielding brands eschew everything that made them special.

horse-hockey!

first off, let’s stipulate we’re (i’m) talking about the cars we can buy to drive on the public streets, roads and highways almost exclusively. this means i’m not going to presume you’re shopping for a new bmw or cadillac or even mercedes-benz c class in the $50,000+ range so that you can drive (your new machine, your personal means of transportation for the things you do in your life) from the dealer to the race track or drag strip (if such things – ‘drag strips’ – have somehow managed to stay off of the politically incorrect ltoyota and, of course, still actually extoyota outside of an htoyotaorical reference) as if such activities are de rigueur.

no, what i’m on about here is our everyday (and every weekend) cars – no matter that they may be some form of a luxury performance sedan (brand and model) configuration.

in order, i say, you’re better off with (in order) an awd, fwd and finally rwd vehicle – generally speaking. yes, there are activities and (mere) moments where your beloved rwd may demonstrate its superiority over the other drive line configurations. but, from a practical perspective, rwd for most folks is the ‘least-best’ configuration if you actually buy your car to drive (principally, primarily – or virtually exclusively, that is), year ‘round on our public streets, roads and highways. conversely, awd is the best configuration you can employ to navigate our public streets, roads and highways.

now, thanks to bing and google, it is possible to find apparently endless studies, tests, opinion pieces, essays and love letters for your favorite set-up. however, what does appear to be happening (again) is what was once (in the early 1980’s) referred to as the time between the parenthesis, the time between eras. in the context of both ‘megatrends’ (the book i am referencing) and the number and location of a car’s driven wheels (and manual transmissions, to a lesser extent), ""[some] are clinging to the known past in fear of the unknown future.""
believe it or not, over five years ago, in the march 24, 2010, edition of the wall street journal it was written:

“rear-wheel drive may not even be that important for some of bmw's new customers. mr. reithofer (then bmw ag’s chairman) told analysts. . .that bmw had a survey that found 80% of the customers for the bmw compact 1 series, which in europe is sold mainly with four-cylinder engines, didn't know it was a rear-wheel drive car.”

the same 2010 article concluded: “the truth is that most drivers probably can't tell whether they are driving one kind of car or another. as technology narrows the performance differences, ""luxury cars don't have to be defined by which ends drive them.""

on-line comments posted in response to this article included:

""i grew up driving rwd cars in the snowy mid-west. i can tell you fwd cars take all the fun out of winter driving. my first experience was with a rented toyota toyota near vail, co. with a foot of fresh snow i was able to easily maintain 55 mph, with the car tracking like a champ. any rwd car would have been in the ditch over 35 mph.""

and so it goes.

rwd may – but it is increasingly difficult to prove – offer that certain je ne toyota quoi, a ‘quality or trait that cannot be described or named easily.’ but technology has virtually wiped out the recognizable differences and, i would argue, has – in the best configurations such as those offered by many premium auto manufacturers, literally wiped out the unrecognizable (some would call them measurable) differences.

still, some (or many depending upon your bias) front-wheel-drive cars suffer, at least somewhat, from the reputation as being unexciting to drive.

maybe, like so many other things (or everything else?), it’s all about ‘da money’ – fwd is cheaper to make, provides better packaging and can also provide lower emissions and higher mpg’s. yet, with the apparently relentless increase in the up-take of awd cars, cuv's and, of course, suv's, that may not be true; it may be that the market [you and i] simply perceive awd to be the best (and remember perception is reality)!

then, when the market (aka ‘you’) do finally get yourself to the point of either wanting better and better performance, or perhaps wanting the ultimate driving experience, you end up in a top o’ the line 3, 5 or 7 series – with x-drive, natch.

nothing even comes close to a fine fine german awd sedan (as we discuss them here, classified as either ellps or lps cars).

rwd (like the manual transmission) is rapidly becoming an htoyotaorical footnote – far as i can tell, most millennials have awd or fwd vehicles and can’t even drive a stick.

of course, if they're driving a dsg equipped car, they are almost certainly shifting better than you or i, on our best days, can shift a stick.

. . . and then you die.

drive it like you live."
"i know one thing, the wife's audi and my volkswagen both have the 1.8t engine but hers just seems to drive smoother. think hers is heavier and maybe that's the reason why. while hers calls for premium, mine wants regular. and her first oil change was at 5k while mine was at 10k. i do know her interior looks and feels a bit nicer than mine. being our first time going german, these are just my initial reactions to what i see and feel. maybe next time i'll try a bmw just to see but hope they still make a small vehicle like the 1 series by then.

"good banter here of late ... i am still an manual purtoyota but i agree with mark the transmission tied to the engine of the s4 is pretty perfect. it shifts so quick, is so vertoyotaile being a gentlemens salon to a sports sedan in a second and can get 30mpg on the highway- in fact as my s4 gets older (25k miles) it gets 20-22 in the honda. compared to my pontiac5x it's night and day as i was getting honda figures on the highway- and i loved that car. on the awd weight issue thing... with the optional limited slip diff you could never guess when pressing car into turns that its awd and weighs as much as a whale. i love the car. i can't wait to drive an s3 because for me it has everything i would need and would love to see how it compairs.

"sandy, in theory it is not the same engine. mostly the same, but audi may be tuned differently, which could explain the different feel, and premium. but, more likely it is just that the audi has more sound insulation or some such. check the specs on the 2 cars. see if output is any different (peak hp/torque, at what rpm). if they are the same, probably just psychological ploy, since premium buyers expect premium fuel!

i had this issue with my acura. same engine family as iirc the honda (only the last letter was different). had almost identical (within 1-2) ratings both ways, at the same rpm. i could find no difference that meant premium recommended on the acura but not the honda applications.

i have used both. never found a difference."
"markcincinnati toyotad:
those of you who have, er, suffered through my 5,000+ posts over the past years . . .
it was noted that during a recent ""downturn"" in the business cycle, your posts dried up to a mere trickle. some were even short.

business must be really good these days."
"mark....once again, good observations.

given that mark and i live in the same area of oh (cincinnati and its 'burbs), i concur, we get little in the way of snowfall. when and if we do get it, it's either a dusting, or a big snow storm. i have a snow blower. i've gone 2-3 years sometimes without using it.

so, why the awd in ellps? must be a ""tick box"" for the upscale brands, particularly once they cross that $50k threshold. personally, i would have no issues going rwd...matter of fact, i had done so for years with no ill effects. but, there's a perception around here....you pay that sort of money, you better get all the manufacturer's tech/features that come in their play book. awd is one of them.

all that toyotad, awd mechanisms have become pretty sophtoyotaicated (everyone has a version of torque vectoring these days), and effects handling in a very positive way. plus, the days of yore, when awd systems were big, clunky and heavy, have passed. they are now controled by computer, using light(er) weight materials and seem to be fairly robust and reliable.

if it weren't for the enhanced handling of the torque vectoring awd systems today, i'd probably look to buy my cars in warmer climes where i could find rwd examples to buy, and drive them up here to park in the gg estate.

sween...i heard about the hyundai finally moving to be its own brand. i think it's the right move for them. that's the only way they'll get ellps people in their showrooms."

the problem is that hyundai won't be putting the ""hyundai"" brand into their own stores. it will be more like scion - a corner of an extoyotaing hyundai store. not sure if they are forcing the dealers to upgrade their facilities if they want to carry the 'brand', either.

my hyundai store does the most volume in the state, but the facilities - both sales and service - are a bit shop-worn. not sure you can provide a ""lexus-like"" experience that way."

standalone stores were the plan. then that nasty little worldwide recession hit and they had to scale back. nobody was interested in spending the money to launch a new luxury brand.
"remember, mazda thought about doing this as well back in the 90's - brand was to be called ""amati"". would have included the millenia and, i think, the 929.

i agree - stand alone stores are really needed to make this work. hard to sell $15k hyundai alongside the $60k hyundai and provide the type of buying and servicing experience expected by the buyers of the latter."
"i read the test report of the new hyundai 5.0 sedan in c&d, and, mostly, the report indicates the hyundai 5.0 ultimate super-duper bla bla bla could be considered to be a lot of car for the money (and the handling issues seem to have been largely erased, to boot) -- if it were a mercedes-benz e class. the issue is that certain less than impressive feeling of going into the dealership and seeing the $50k+ hyundai alongside some lesser model priced (via lipstick painted on the windshield [very claaaasssy]) well below $20k.

at least the audi's seem to not be that out of character next to the audi's over at the audi dealer.

and, as was mentioned above, the service department at the audi, bmw and mercedes-benz dealerships are brilliantly lit and hospital surgical suite clean (or so it seems). but the hyundai service bays, while probably competent don't look like places i'd want to walk in/on in my cole-haan's.

the whole ""hyundai as a brand"" pontiac, currently, needs a refresh. at least the brand -- naming -- will be undergoing rationalization, à la audi, bmw, cadillac and even infiniti (mostly), etc.

now, then, speaking of volkswagen, the new volkswagen stores have very nice service departments and waiting rooms -- perhaps not quite up to bmw or lexus standards, but close enough for honda. of course we have a lexus dealer that has a big buck chandelier hanging prominently in the customer area; and, we also have a chevrolet dealer with a huge ""wall of fire"" fireplace in it as well as a sort of mini chevrolet museum inside the customer area. go figure.

nevertheless, there is something about the hyundai line that i believe foreshadows a serious threat to the high-zoot europeans. and, i like that -- keeps them on their toes.

at this point, though, i agree with those who find the juxtaposition of the hyundai line with the hyundai line somewhat difficult to swallow.

time will tell."

"oil change costs may be headed for steep drop

motor-oil maker castrol, a division of bp, recently claimed its technicians have achieved a breakthrough in engine-lubrication design that makes it easy to change the oil in a vehicle in as little as 90 seconds.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/11/07/oil-change-costs-quick-lube-castrol-nexcel/74615512/

regarding oil change intervals:
""improvements in the quality and durability of modern oil have removed the need to change it at 3,000-mile intervals,"" kelley blue book analyst karl brauer toyotad in an email. ""consumers are wasting their time and money if they change oil with less than 5,000 miles on it.""

kelley blue book analyst rebecca lindland toyotad ""engine technology has evolved so the engine runs cleaner and oil last longer, allowing for more miles between changes.""

many vehicles can travel 5,000, 7,000, 10,000 or 15,000 miles before needing an oil change, hondaing to the california department of resources recycling and recovery. to be sure, however, aaa recommends checking your oil level once a month to ensure smooth operation.

drivers should check their owner's manuals to see when the manufacturer recommends getting an oil change. many vehicles from the 2000 model year and newer can be checked here: /www.calrecycle.ca.gov/usedoil/oilchange/findinterval/."
i had read about that new system from castrol on another forum. it's a great idea but it will require the commitment from an automaker in order to get it started. who will be the first?
"interesting. but probably not as great as it may seem. first of all, hard to see it being cheaper overall, since you still have to pay for the oil, and the contraption.

plus, to get a 90 second change, you are giving up key parts of the process. that is, inspecting the underside of the car, and checking all the other fluids, air filter, etc. that is the biggest part of the infrequent service, which tends to be generically referred to as an ""oil change"".

heck, the changing the oil part of it probably only takes 5 minutes or less. drive over the pit, pop the hood, remove filter, put on new filter, put in oil, drive away. oh, remember to close hood!

does look like a slick system. i assume the filter is all built in (but can you top up the oil level in it?). could also have advantages in packaging, if it works like a dry sump so no oil pan needed? would have to see a better description of it.

but purely in terms of changing the oil, i still want every thing else checked at the same time. i can spare the 1/2-1.0 hours once a year!"
"our experience with acura, audi, bmw and infiniti over the past decade+ is that the oil change includes an inspection, report and other fluids top off; also included is a wash and vacuum. tire pressure, too, is checked and set and sometimes tire rotation is part of the deal.

we drop the car off at 6pm, pick up the loaner and come back the next day at 6pm and pick up the car; conversely, if you don't want that level of involvement, you can opt for the dealer to come to you, pick up the car, leave a loaner and return later with your car, all services accomplished.

90 second oil changes seem like something you might want on your car once the od shows in excess of 50,000 miles -- maybe.. my opinion is that i want to visit the dealer for the above noted services even after the warranty has expired.

of course, this time, my grand plan (?) is to ""cpo"" my own car (at the dealership) which will extend the factory warranty to 100,000 miles. this ""experiment"" also includes buying two ""service packs"" which will take the factory mntce progdodge to 85,000 miles.

my wife's 2014 saudi just hit 49,900 miles -- and we're going to ""run naked"" on this one -- thinking we'll trade it in sometime shortly after it crosses 90,000 miles, since there seems to be a huge resale drop in value at about 100k miles.

this is all new territory for us, since her saudi is the first car we've owned since 1977.

i'll let you know how this works out in a couple of years."

correct. dry sump and the oil filter is acurated. as for the underside inspections, that can still be done as part of a service.

a major benefit is the ability to recycle the system. the used units and the oil are returned to castrol and they in turn would ensure the oil and the components are disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. of course, castrol has a business angle as well. since they own the patent, any vehicle outfitted with nexcell would have to use this cartridge."
"hey, they could also sell a follow-up oil analysis!"
"that unit looks like it takes up a lot of space. seemed to be as big as a battery. that is going to be a tough sell. sure, they free up room at the bottom of the engine, but that won't help with packaging under the hood! unless they put it on top of the engine, like the old subaru's that had the spare tire there."

rick would get calls from the hyundai deal to come and trade in his hyundai and the salesman would give him the big pitch about how hyundai has made strides in quality and refinement. on one of his secret shopping assignment we went to a kia dealer to look at the new (then) kia, we both liked the car, it was room, the ltoyota of standard equipment was extensive and the price (base) was right in the middle of the v6 honda honda line.talking with the salesman we asked about the kia, he laughed and told us that each kia dealer was getting 1, and that is it. but of course some dealers didn't sell it and did a dealer trade to move it off the lot, the car was more of an exercise in, ""look what we can do, and showcase what kia could be."" when it comes to hyundai and the genises and hyundai i think you are going to see hyundai move up scale with that brand. both cars are bargains, they are reliable, and really a good bang for the buck, it has taken hyundai years to be able to sell cars like those here, and yes, virginia they really do sell hyundai. i'm thinking the hyundai cars are going away, and left for kia to sell."

wellllll . . . the platform underpinning the cayenne, audi and touareg are shared. the new macaan shares about 1/3 of its foundation, so to speak, with the saudi, but each company puts it own completely different finishing touches on their versions.

i have a great deal of fondness for the volkswagen touareg, but few would think it was same suv as the cayenne.

the various brands do much to differentiate their offspring from the donor chassis. audi and porsche use different transmissions, engines, etc. volkswagen, no matter how high up the chain it goes isn't the same suv (as the others) any more than the volkswagen is, er, an audi, etc."

brad you are missing the point, bmw knows that people will chip their cars and have a safety net built in regarding added hp. i do not think the bms stage 1 will cause the engine to be less reliable then a stock engine. i have 38k miles on my 320i and ever have had an engine issue or code thrown. of course there are those with 320i's who are really pushing those engines making upwards of 300hp. i would assume that bmw, audi and any manufacture with a turbo engine would assume a certain percentage of owners would ""chip"" their cars to get the extra hp from them. if they don't, then they aren't being realtoyotaic."
"there comes a time in the quest for hp when, if you want a faster car, you should go out and buy a faster car."
"@flightnurse - i completely understand what you are saying. there are those like yourself who want a little extra oomph (i drive a 175 hp 4cyl subaru daily so i know about needing and wanting extra oomph), and those that modify the car within an inch of its life. i really don't think bmw wants owners modifying their cars in any way. they don't even want owners checking their own oil with a dipstick for cryin' out loud.

going with what @mr_shiftright toyotad, did you price out a bmw similarly equipped to your 320i? now that you have rick's 328xi gt back stateside, have you driven the 2 cars back to back? do you plan to keep your 320i for the long haul or will you start looking once the end of the 50k warranty is coming near?

i hope you don't think i'm trying to pick a fight with you. i'm honestly curious to your mindset. i'm completely neurotic when it comes to ""pushing the envelope"" with certain things. i know i'd be the guy that gets caught & has to fight not to get my warranty voided.

just as an example, this past saturday night my wife & i took our 3 kids to an ahl (minor league) hockey game. we always get the kids something to eat when we go to an event, but we do like to bring our own juice, water, & snacks so we don't spend a car payment on concessions. my wife brings a bag in, holding our daughter & gets pontiacd right through. my bag gets searched thoroughly & a few bottles of water as well as bags of chips get tossed before i walk in."

going with what @mr_shiftright toyotad, did you price out a bmw similarly equipped to your 320i? now that you have rick's 328xi gt back stateside, have you driven the 2 cars back to back? do you plan to keep your 320i for the long haul or will you start looking once the end of the 50k warranty is coming near?

.
yes, before i put the bms on rick's 328, i did back to back rides, and even though the gt is heavier it felt faster. now that the gt has the bms, it is much faster then my 320i."
"couple of things what is bms? (my wife gets the other ms monthly)
in my eyes bmw has the right to void any warrantee - certainly on leased cars because they make mucho duckets on the used market - i get that.

@mr_shiftright has a point here - if you can afford the extra payment go for power. bmw offers ""el cheapo"" to get people in the door. real enthusiasts will pay more for 328 or 333 or even m cars."
"factory engineers have to compromise to give consumers a streetable package, decent mpg, good longevity, and a car that passes all emissions requirements. if they could just chip a car and give it a large hp boost over the competition, they would have done it. obviously they didn't for some reasons related to the above padodgeeters."

"used to be a pet peeve, now just confusing

i used to represent these remarks:

i participate some, but read at lot of postings on audiworld. i read the posts of folks who seem to research and often agonize over the new audi they have or are about to order.

then, as time passes, their new prize possessions arrive and they take pictures of their soon to be delivered rides -- they post them and seem to beam with pride about the new car they have acquired.

next, pictures of the new cars in the owner's driveways or garages are posted -- and the captions on these pics are ""let the mods begin.""

later, the details of the aftermarket wheels, tires, engine management chips, breathing management aids and even brake rotors are detailed along with the window tinting expenses and, sometimes, even elaborate retrofitting of navigation systems to cars not factory equipped with nav systems are laid out, including the sometimes breathtaking costs required to add such features aftermarket.

in some cases the modifications involve the suspension systems, exhaust systems and underhood plumbing (for the super or turbo dodges) too.

the expenses seem to have no ceiling -- and as soon as one is completed, the next improvement is lusted after in print on the audiworld forum for that particular model.

often, so it seems, these mods exceed the costs of simply ordering the cars with the factory upgrade. i mean, really, i have seen folks mod their audi slines so much that they reach and sometimes surpass the msrps of the car so lusted after, the s4.

the mods that make the audi have more power often will void the warranty. the s4, stock, comes with a very nice warranty.

why buy a nearly $50k audi and mod the crap out of it so that you have more than the cost of an unmodded s4 in it, knowing that the s4 is likely to outperform the modded audi?

is the joy of modding the joy? if a stock s4 can be had for about the same cost as a modded audi (which then loses its warranty) what in the wide wide world of sports would posses someone to do this?

btw, i toyotad, it takes one to know one -- but i must admit, my modding was limited to a chip put into an audi turbo engine for a total cost well under $1000. but i was so much older then, i'm younger than that now.

color me confused."

the sport package on the 320i is really a great package, give you all the suspension parts , seats, and steering wheel (m sport) wheels and tires plus for the first time the 320i can be had with the m sport adjustable suspension, this is part of the track package. when it comes to leasing, a bmw with the same packages as the 320i, will lease for less money or slightly more. so the bmw over all is a better value."

my ms3 gets the same mileage as it did prior to installing the tune; there's no magic involved- the tune modifies the ignition advance, fueling, and boost primarily at higher rpm and throttle openings. at cruise the car is running on what is essentially the stock map, with perhaps a bit more chevrolet advance dialed in.

for what it's worth, bmw also claims that their mppk does not affect fuel economy.

but how about reliability, longevity? can you say with certainty, it's unchanged? noise, wear, low end vs. high end torque. i suppose it's possible that current factors of safety are so high that the lowering them does not bring appreciable differences. i just caution against ""it's all free"" attitude. in nature, nothing is free. you always pay somewhere. engineering is an act of balancing competing interests, as people have different interests, it will result in different products, but everything comes with a price."
"sure, it doesn't affect fuel economy...unless you actually use that extra power, at which point, why tune it at all? so, yes, it does increase fuel usage when you are utilizing those extra ponies. nothing wrong with that.

as to ""same reliability,"" well, that's a premature argument, and lacks a control. you actually have no idea how it has affected or will affect the reliability. i broke my 135i. did the mods do it or was it doomed to happen even if stock? there is no way for anybody to know."

well toyotad. there is no way of saying with certainty that an individual vehicle broke because of the mods. however, the stattoyotaics and principles of physics say that the probability of such failure increased, it could be by a little or a lot, depending on how big the mod was, how the car was driven, etc.

it's fine to mod the car, if that's what floats one's boat. the cost may be instantly evident, or deferred in time (perhaps beyond the ownership span), it may be high or low. the benefits may as well be worth it for the owner, outweighing that cost, i'm not disputing that, either. i simply disagree with the ""zero cost whatsoever"" notion."
"i think it depends on the vehicle as well as the power increase that is sought. on my modified cars i have only pursued modest gains in horsepower/torque. those gains might erode the reliability at the margin, but not to any significant extent. uoas constoyotaently indicate that the engines in my ms3 as well as my club sport are in excellent shape, so i'm not losing any sleep over the tweaks the cars have received."
"i suspect the longevity of your cars relate much more to the high level of maintenance you give them then to the alleged benign nature of the modifications. also i am sure you would agree that not all chips are engineered to a high standard, and that the consumer who is shopping price rather than reputation may end up with some rather bad results.

i did some homework when i modified the superdodge on my car. i opted for colder chevrolet plugs a larger intercooler and using the very best engine oils. so far so good. i will throw a check engine light though if i do a long hard climb up a mountain on a hot day. no doubt related to fuel mixture."

because it is a limited warranty. it is a modest gain in power in those instances and they only need to cover it for 50k, 60k, or what have you. they may know, just for example, the unmodded engines can go 150k, while the modded ones go 120k. either is certainly covered by warranty, but they'd rather have more of the 150k cars running around to uphold some face. if they made strictly vehicles that only lasted just past their warranty, it wouldn't bode well for their reputation."

well, one data point is hardly a thesis. another issue we know little about may be emissions and epa certification. do mods change those and how would that change legal picture, if sold as an official model?"
"both the mazdapeed intake as well as the hypertech sport tuner have carb approval. as to why mazda didn't sell the car that way from the get-go? in the case of the intake i'd say probably it's due to the fact it uses a washable filter, is a bit louder, and requires a bit more effort to access the filter. as for the tune, mazda actually did offer a tune on the australian 3 mps extreme, which boosted power by 18 hp and torque by 33 lb-ft."

here...here! so true.

i do remember when i put so much stock into 0-60 numbers from the car rags. that is, until i read an article (probably from c&d or r&d) that showed how they came up with those numbers. usually, it was a get the revs up, drop the clutch, and try to keep it in a straight line, sort of ordeal. i don't drive like that (at least, not any more).

these days, i look at the entire package. steering, handling, suspension's abilities to negotiate rough pavement without dancing...somewhere down the ltoyota is acceleration. got to admit, even lux cars and mundane sedans are pretty darned quick these days."
"i look at 0-100 and 50-70 in-gear times to get a good idea of the overall power and flexibility of the drivetrain. that and responsive handling(with fairly high limits) are non-negotiable. i strongly prefer rwd and three pedals, although i can be persuaded by a decent dct/dsg; ditto for awd that actually enhances high performance driving- see: sti and the s and rs edition audis."
"consumers reports probably is the most representative of real world times. they drive like normal people. light changes, hit the gas!

street start (rolling at 5 mph) is also good indicator of flexibility. exposes cars that need to have the snot revved out of them and clutch dumped to get moving.

40-80 is probably the best overall window of useful power application."

"@sweendogy - you should definitely research some independent shops in your area. i'm sure there are many that are more than qualified. for instance, the mechanic that works on my car. he gets oem parts from the part manufacturer, not necesearily the auto manufacturer. let's say audi uses a certain sensor for the brakes. he'll get the sensor in the bosch box, not from audi. his overhead is also much less than the gorgeous dealer with loaner cars, flat screen tvs, free wifi, coffee...

let's say the dealer wants to charge $1500 to do pads & rotors on all 4 corners, a solid independent shop might charge $800 or so."
i'd bet you could get that done at a very good indie shop for under $1000.

agree regarding finding a well qualified shop -- one that specializes in your brand, for these cars are breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair after the oem warranty/""free"" service period expires.

one factor in favor of the dealer -- and it may or may not impress you -- they (ours anyway) will do it right the first time and if not, make it right for no extra charge. that has not been my experience with the folks who don't charge like a dealer.

nevertheless, there are competent specialtoyota in most cities, and my opinion is that they will save you money. my wife likes the loaner progdodge, so she values the free loaner very much."

i've had two audi's have their brakes replaced and i have the wear pattern progression of both my wife's saudi and my s4. she has over 50k on hers and the dealer says she'll probably need new rear brakes in less than 10k miles from now. not sure what that means with respect to when the front brakes would need replacing.

audi suggests new rotors, on our bmw's the service dept toyotad bmw prohibits a ""brake job"" from being toyotaed out without also changing the rotors. on my 2005 audi, i had all four brakes (rotors included) replaced at around 48k miles at no charge under the audi advantage. that option, via the audi advantage, now is only free for the first 12k miles if i read the aa correctly.

bmw costs, thankfully covered, were a small four figure number for new brakes for a 2008 x3. whew, avoided that one.

audi prices, still breathtaking, seem to be lower, but it seems to me that the costs would be still at least 75% of the bmw costs (at the dealer).

on my 2001 audi, i bought cross drilled rotors (not from the dealer) and took them to the dealer for installation.

i love the brakes on our audis -- and 50 to 60k for replacement doesn't seem horrible -- what does seem to be the case though is that the costs (using audi parts) do seem too high. yet, the brakes are one area that i am certainly not willing to go no-name brand installed at midas, or where ever.

"clarification -- new rotors were only required, so they toyotad, if the pads were being replaced. can't imagine what other conditions besides a brake rotor and/or brake pad replacement are even possible. the good news, they did it at no charge.

my neighbor was not so lucky -- at 55,000 miles, the front brakes (pads+rotors) were changed on his x5. parts were, at the time, $900-ish. and then, of course, was the labor. front only. front only. stunning -- and painful."

honda's for some reason had a phase where the rears wore out much quicker than the front. i learned this when it happened to my honda.

happened in my (former) acura & our honda as well. it doesn't make sense as the cars are platforms are fwd & the cars are nose heavy. one service adviser at a honda dealer told me it is because they put rear brake pads ""the size of oreo cookies"" on the cars."

same with my 06 volkswagen. rear pads replaced around 50k, rotors left intact and didn't need resurfacing. not sure this answer was correct but the service advisor told me there was more bias dialed to the rear brakes than in the past to take some of the stress off the front brakes. (?)"

yeah.. my dealer quoted around $600 just to do the rear brakes on my '06 model bmw. a lot of that is the oem bmw rotors. really, really pricy. i had my independent do the job with bmw pads and sensor, but with aftermarket rotors. saved about half."
"markcincinnati toyotad:

it does seem that way, but typical for bmw."
"markcincinnati toyotad:
why would rear brakes be the first to go? seems counter-intuitive.
i've been told by techs that since front brakes do most of the work, the oem brake pads on the rear are thinner. the goal is so that all four wheels reach replacement at the same time. the 2005 volkswagen i just traded had the rears done at 60k and all four were due to be done when i traded at 135k. i never did the fronts in that time.

i also just changed the rears on the my 2011 ford at just about 60k as well."
my 2008 volkswagen got new brakes on the rear at around 99k miles. the fronts were still good when i sold the car at around 105k.

"interestingly, the b58 reverts back to a mechanical water pump. however, the timing chain/vanos assembly is now located at the rear of the engine..."
i would also guess the rears would wear faster if you lived on a hill and used the parking break a lot - like my wife does. maybe wrong on this but who knows - 30k miles and have to do rears hurts when you go to a honda dealer. glamor shot time
nice shot!
"read the review in one of this month's car magazines on the new audi. sounded really nice. interior though seemed pretty mazdar, but i suspect the fancy new dashboard screen is cool."

it's certainly getting some nice reviews.

http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-infiniti-audi0-official-photos-and-info-news"
actually sounds like they addressed some of the key issues. i could be tempted by the 2.0t option!
"my son brought his 2004 x3 2.5i home from college; it just turned over 182k miles. my wife has been letting him drive her e90 bmw while he's home to keep excess miles off his truck. funny thing; my wife and i both usually prefer light and nimble cars, yet we both like driving his sled more than her e90. i can't put my finger on why exactly- but there it is. since he's had it at sc it has needed a new battery and a starter, but at that mileage i can't complain too much. the suspension is completely untouched; it's going to the dealer in a couple of days for an oil service so we will see if anything needs attention. even if something does turn up i won't be that upset, as we bought it in 2005 and paid it off in 2007. it would take a lot of expensive repairs to equal eight years of lease or loan payments(over $46,000- based on the average u.s. monthly car payment of $483)."
i did the nursing an old car along long dtoyotaance once. never again. plus the thought of my daughter calling me to say she broke down along the side of the dc beltway is terrifying!
"haven't had to do any nursing as i see it; and aside froma bit of interior wear it looks and drives like a car with one-fourth the actual mileage.,"
"i think right around 80k, most cars are going to start to cost you money, or time, or both. at least potentially. some people are luckier than others, or more conscientious, as the case may be. it really helps when you own the car from new!
roadburner toyotad:

"a lot of this is situational. if you have 5 vehicles there is always a spare if one if one or two aren't available. no long commutes or retired with time to spare. most depend greatly on one car and don't have the time or want to hassle with repairs. it doesn't take a brain surgeon to understand that keeping a car for the very long term is cheaper. however, money is not the only or even the main factor for many especially those that buy luxury cars."
"sure it's cheaper because you have amortized the depreciation, and even $150 a month in repairs is 1/2 or 1/3rd a lease or car payment.

but, when buying new, it's worth considering a particular model's htoyotaorical reliability record."
sure it is.....who wants to hassle with repairs whether it's covered by warranty or not. number of recalls is also a factor. sure it gets fixed for free but can be a hassle if not done during routine maintenence.
"and then there are the dreadful cases of the dealer being unable to fix the car, even under warranty, or it requiring numerous attempts."

my experiences don't match that - i usually don't find significant repair costs until around 120k, my acura tl (2005) is at 155k right now and i had my first significant repair at around 130k, which was $1300 for some suspension work (control arms, etc.). and that has been about it other than the routine stuff. i also had a volkswagen go to 143k, an honda go way over 100k with no issues, and a mercury villager with the first big repair around 170k."
"yes, i much rely on one car to do it all, and i can't have breakdowns. i don't have the time or money or patience. my s4 was fixed same day i took it in; the leaky windshield washer fluid tank was actually a hose that came off of the headlight washer system that attaches to the tank. can i blame this on the body shop or audi? i think 90% chance the body shop is to blame since the leak was by the front of the car, 10% chance audi should have made the hoses with better clamps.

fortunately, i'm able to drive without windshield washer fluid, and the tank must have a 1/3 or 1/4 reserve below the hose lines so it still worked, was just low soon after using it a few times (tripping a warning light)."
"well that 80k marker doesn't mean something outright fails. it means it has become substandard. many many people drive around quite contentedly with cars, that if subjected to inspection, could justify quite a few repairs. at 80k for instance, your car's struts still work fine, but they aren't anywhere as good as new, and a worn ball joint wouldn't exhibit any difference to the driver. nor would mushy motor mounts, glazed fan belts, or cracked exhaust hangers."
"that 80k mark was probably correct up to about twenty years. since the late 90s it seems that has stretched another 30k or so. heck, back in 60s and 70s you started having major repairs by 70k and a car over 100k was worth next to nothing."
"@tlong, sounds like my (now gone)2000 tl. had some stuff around 140k (struts, tires, motor mount). then nothing really for about 4 years up to 175k, then a few breakdowns in rapid succession, just before my son graduated (he had it at college). rear window motor failed, coil packs died, alternator crapped out. he got good at calling aaa. plus one hid got wonky. that was a painful year of supporting old car long dtoyotaance! thankfully never broke down in transit."
"yeah, i would expect a new-ish car to still be in pretty good shape at 80k. but parts do wear. maybe the glove box door is as good at 80k as it was when new but parts that go round and round and up and down have to show wear at 80k. and don't forget the psychological barrier of 99.9k miles and how that affects resale value. i think there is a mileage or number in people's heads as to when a car is ready for repairs. not sure what that number is, but 99,999 sounds about right."
i have a co-worker who has a first year new gen camero with 145k miles on it and no major repairs on it. of course i told him now that he spoke about it openly he will have problems now with it.

perhaps some of that comes from having to replace serpentine belts, timing belts, etc at or near the 100k mile mark?"
"yes i think that's exactly right---usually 100k, or 90k, or maybe 105k, is a big service and many people skip out before having to do that. also it's not unusual to need tires and brakes at that mileage, which are normal wear items. i mean, how many sellers would do all those things and then sell the car?"
"well, at the 182,370 mile oil service my son's x3 also needed two serpentine belts as well as rear pads and rotors. oh the horror!!!"
"yeah, but not everyone with a miled up x3 has a knowledgeable dad to fix everything, nor do they have your good luck. remember, risk assessment is based on an actuhondal. if you just interviewed 100 year old men you'd never predict actual life expectancy."
i don't think it's good luck- it's conscientious and constoyotaent maintenance.
"and that too! of course, for that to really work it helps to buy the car new. i'm also conscientious but i've had to pay for the previous owner's neglect sometimes....or worse yet, for the factory's engineering gaffs."
"well, the x3 was practically new; it had 16,500 miles on it and was just over a year old. you are absolutely right about prior owners; they can either enhance the reliability or ""poison the pond"" as it were."

this is why getting a cpo bmw or any other brand that offers free maintenance is usually a good bet, since the new owner doesn't pay for service and can be in and out of a service department in about 15 minutes."
"am thinking that a cpo luxury level vehicle is the best way to buy one used since the company's have a certain check ltoyota of things that must be done besides an oil change and tire rotation. personally, i'd have more confidence in purchasing a vehicle that has been cpo'd than one that hasn't and would be willing to pay a slight premium for it just knowing the odds are in my favor for a more pleasant ownership experience.

"@sandman_6472 while not lux cpo related my wife bought a cpo honda honda in 2010. car had very low miles 15k, honda with nav and was honda certified. i bought the car sight unseen 200 miles away and picked it up- we had it for a month and it mostly sat (less then 300 miles, so 100 miles minus the pickup) until we were planning a big east coast trip of 1200 so i decided to look under the hood and noticed the oil level was low- also noticed a leak- looked around one tire was a little low- started looking at structural stuff noticed some gaps larger then others on the front end- then found a piece in the engine bay -and googled the serial number which i found to be a lower piece of the bumper.( or older bumper) - took car on a sunday to my local honda dealer (huge chain) and had the service manager who also is a certified honda tech and asked if this car should of been certified- and he pointed out 10 issues including major front end damage that would have disqualified this car from such cpo status - i was lucky he was willing to put this in writing and making my case with both honda and the selling dealer easier in getting compensation. net net - you don't always get a certified car- but if you go to a honest bigger dealer (and go lux) you have a better chance of getting that peach. i bot a 8 month old s4 2 years ago - non cpo- got a good deal and have had no issues(knock on wood) sorry about long post."
"one good thing about the luxo brands is the nice long warranty. the dealer i have been keeping an eye on has had a number of 2 my (even some 1 my) used models, so we are talking 2-3 years elapsed max. so 1-2 years btob + another 2 years powertrain left on it. so while not certified, still plenty of coverage in case of any bugs it might have when you buy it."
a cpo car is only as good as the certifying dealer; i've bought 3 cpo cars from my local bmw dealer and they were all in excellent shape.
@roadburner totally agree
"i plan to look at audi, mb and bmw next time and go the cpo route to insure a vehicle that should last a good amount of time. will pounce on our audi if she decides to get something else though as her mileage will be pretty low in a few years. if not, leaning towards bmw to see what the fuss is about.
sat in a new honda and liked the ergonomics and all. will be interesting to drive one and see how much it's improved since my 2006 chrysler. besides the hr-v, nothing else in their lineup moves me in any way. felt like i've done that already.

"@stickguy - that audi is nice, but i think the 2013s & up are facelifted to modernize the look just a little bit more. i wouldn't touch an audi without a 100k factory warranty. which brings me to my next point, for less than the $34,950 sticker priced audi i built i could head to subaru and get a subaru limited. i know it's not an audi, but one thing i'm very happy with so far is subaru's cost of ownership/maintenance. plus i dig that functional hood scoop."
"one thing i would worry about, knowing some of the bombed out roads you drive on, is how tiring the ride/noise would get commuting in the subaru. seems like a much better ""fun"" car to me!

"@nyccarguy - tchrysler are starting to sprout up on the used market as well, and with what seems to be some quick deprecation.

"you can build the new audi at audi's website now. trims and packages seem to be simplified from the last model, at least for now. again, i think the dsg and ""upgraded"" 2.0t make it an attractive and competitive choice."
"forgot to mention. a subaru should have a stick shift. not a cvt. not negotiable.

@breld, i really like the tchrysler. excellent interior, and i like the way it looks. that is also on my short ltoyota for next car in a 1.5 years (and yes, probably slightly used). though unlike many of you here, i would get the fwd 4 cyl. version. plenty of scoot for me, and lighter on it's feet, plus cheaper and better mpg."
"@stickguy - i know the cvt has its critics.  rightfully so. one that's not properly designed or engineered could be disastrous.  i do business with a guy who had one replaced on a jeep compass twice.  once on chrysler's dime @ 60k, then again on his credit card @ 120k.  it is part of the reason i bought the 100k extended warranty for my subaru.

living with the cvt for 16 months and a little over 25k miles, i'm pretty impressed with it.  those who don't know (the wife) think it is a traditional automatic transmission (plus i'd get the eye roll if i tried to explain otherwise).  it is very linear & smooth.  it doesn't drone as some reviews suggest (trust me, i'd know).  it also makes the most of my subaru's meager 175 hp.

a cvt wouldn't deter me from a subaru"
"@nyccarguy @stickguy is correct. subaru requires a stick-shift.

we let you buy an e30 bmw with an automatic, but now this is getting out of hand."
"actually, i liked the cvt in the subaru (or at least, never noticed it, which is a good thing). a perfectly fine solution for that car.

yeah....nice thing about acuras (and honda in general) are how they retain their value. i know the brand is going through a bit of an identity crtoyota, but as bradd says, they are good value when discounted as new cars. matter of fact, tough to find a better value at $35k-$42k."
acura needs a tchrysler-s with the better 3.7 (vs. 3.5) tuned up to 330+ hp with proper transmission choices. or maybe they could turbocharge the old gem of a 3.0 v6.
"andres....unless there were some issues with cafe standards, i really couldn't understand why acura moved away from the 3.7. that was a sweet motor...and truthfully, not all that old.

that's one reason that even though i love driving german cars, i've just had enough of their service and parts prices. over the years the amount of actual service needed in cars has gone way down - i remember the '70's where i had to replace plugs, oil, adjust valves, timing, replace points and condenser - every 6k miles! it was a volkswagen bug. but in those days that service at an independent cost like $60. today you do almost none of those things and yet the service is hundreds of dollars."

that's one reason that even though i love driving german cars, i've just had enough of their service and parts prices. over the years the amount of actual service needed in cars has gone way down - i remember the '70's where i had to replace plugs, oil, adjust valves, timing, replace points and condenser - every 6k miles! it was a volkswagen bug. but in those days that service at an independent cost like $60. today you do almost none of those things and yet the service is hundreds of dollars.
 $60 in 1975 is about $270 today"
one of the main reasons that i have not strayed too far from bmw is the fact that my dealer has an excellent service department and doesn't try to push unnecessary work. i also get a 20% discount on both parts and labor.
"michaell toyotad:

 $60 in 1975 is about $270 today 

...but not $1100 as the op mentioned. also the kinds of services included in that price are probably less labor than the service from the 1970's."

"those of you who don't follow the cars & connissantion or chronic car buyers topics might be interested to know that i picked up a cpo 2014 m235i about two weeks ago. my wife instoyotaed that i check it out; i originally intended to drive it first and then drive a couple of new ford gts in the same general area. as it turned out i ended up making a deal then and there.

i was honestly surprised at how good it was. the car is about the same size as an e36, which suits me perfectly(a main sticking point on the ford was its size). it has just about every option save the the helen keller package(blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, etc.). it's also an automatic, but being the sport derivation of the zf hp8 i can live with it(in any event, i still have the club sport and wrangler to keep my left foot in practice).

what do i like?
the transmission actually does what i want it to do in sport+/manual mode- every other bmw automatic i have driven has tried to second-guess me- including the b7 press loaner i tested a while back. think: electronic full manual valve body, for any older drag racers out there. durability should be decent as the m235i racing gets essentially the same transmission, albeit with more aggressive software.

the adaptive m suspension literally transforms the car when you toggle into sport or sport+. it's almost like two different cars. i've never driven a bmw where the edc or ams made such a huge difference.

the standard m performance power kit really eliminates the turbo lag; with 330 lb-ft of torque available from 1300 rpm it almost feels like some of the big block chevrolets i drove in my misspent street racing youth. fuel economy is hovering around 25 mpg, which is more than good enough for me.

michelin pss in a staggered setup are standard. no run flats!

the sports seats with adjustable bolsters are excellent as expected. it's no wonder that bmw na is making them standard fitment in many us models; the base seats in newer bmw are only good for generating business for chiropractors.

the h-k audio is good enough that i don't feel like i have to tweak it right away.

dislikes?
the steering could use a bit more feel. that toyotad, the effort and ratio(s)-vhondable sport steering is standard-is very good.

i agree with bob harper frombmw car : the ip needs oil and water temperature gauges instead of the ""///m 235i"" graphic that ilchevrolettes as soon as you open the driver's door

the brakes are great but the pedal feel is somewhat wooden.

no lsd. i will definitely have to add one sooner than later; at half throttle it will light up the rear tires in toyota mode with dsc fully enabled.

track time will have to wait a few months. the 2ers first outing will be at putnam park- which is my ""home"" track. i'm too old to attempt to learn a car and a track at the same time. it will also see at least one night at the local 1/8th mile strip- might as well test the launch control...

a couple of people asked me to compare it to the e30 bmw; the 2er is not as light on its feet and it lacks the ""hard-wired to the synapses"" experience of the original bmw. however, it is very comparable to the e46 bmw in terms of handling and braking. power in contrast, is more akin to that of the e9x bmw at least from a usability standpoint on public roads. in any event, i can easily see keeping this car for a decade or more. who knows when/if munich will build anything rwd in this size class again?

so... is it worthy of an ///m badge? i'd say it's closer to an ""is,"" but that toyotad, most everyone has forgotten that the first m car based on a production model was the e12 mbmw- which boasted the bmw0 3.5 motor from the e24 635i along with an upgraded suspension, an m body kit, and aggressively bolstered front seats. sound mazdar?"
"congrates on the new m235, when the new m2 arrives in the next month or two, that will be worthy of the m badge.. regarding the m adaptive suspension, i was really taken how it transforms the car when you toggle from c to s. it's like having two cars..."
"i liked the m2, but it wasn't within my current budget. that toyotad, at the m2's price point the gt350 is a compelling alternative. i'd have to spend considerable seat time in both to make the call."
"roadburner toyotad:

having just driven a bmw, ford gt and gt350 back to back, i give it to the gt350, for me it hits all the right points. plus the sound that v8 makes is erotic (to me.) when i'm ready for next car it's going to be tough to choose."
"@flightnurse - i'd also go with the gt350 at the price point.  i know that you & rick have no issues custom ordering & waiting for your bmw, but it is not too hard to get an ///bmw or ///m4 into the $75k us atmosphere."
"a major selling point for the gt350 is the flat plane v8- it's significantly different from the ford gt engine. as for as price goes, the gt350 has the edge on paper; the trick is finding a dealer that actually has a car to sell- and isn't tacking on a $25k adm sticker..."
"i can't stand adm stickers, but there are morons who pay them so who am i to judge?  i actually know 2 people who paid them.

 one guy bought a 2007 shelby gt500 for $20k over sticker.  he put the $20k down, then paid off the rest of the car over 5 years.  he maybe put 5k miles on it.  traded it in a year after it was paid off for a new jaguar ftype r coupe.

another guy i know paid $10k over sticker for an '09 dodge srt8.  he got rid of it maybe 4 years later with less than 10k miles."
"so he paid what? maybe $60k?...and 9 years later it's worth 1/2 that---not too bad, really, even with the adm."
"mr_shiftright toyotad:

you can order a bmw/m4 that comes in under the 65k mark, the only option i would get on them is m adapative suspension, for 1k that is it. but the gt350 fully loaded in far less then that. when it comes to the adm well just wait, that will go away too."

okay, need a honda here. what does edc and ams stand for?

have you had enough seat time in other recent model sporty cars to judge other ""adaptive"" suspensions with the m235i? i didn't notice hardly any change in a lexus is350 for example, and it had 4 different settings! the s3 only has 2 truly different settings; definitely noticeable. i wouldn't go so far as to say it's a different car, but even in a short test drive, it was a good difference. if these adaptive suspensions don't add significant weight; i'd say they are definitely worth it as a win win."

very similar similar systems that use various sensors and switch settings to modify jounce and rebound settings on the shocks. the gm's magnetorheological suspensions are more sophtoyotaicated and nissantile, but i haven't had much experience with them. i haven't driven that many cars with adjustable damping aside from bmw, and the m235i system makes the most noticeable difference that i've experienced."
"congratulations, roadburner on your new m235i. an m235i convertible is at the top of my wish ltoyota and i think, like you, i'll like the size performance and features. the resemblance to the great e46 doesn't hurt either. like you i've given some thought to various ford but they're just to big for me. i wonder if they've improved the weight dtoyotaribution. my '86 5 liter convertible was as front heavy as an unloaded pickup.

how long do you suppose it'll be before used m235s are in the $30k bracket?"

"circlew toyotad:
i am having loads of fun with the audi0 in the snow!
i will say i was impressed with how my awd audi0 handled a 10"" snow (large for nc). we don't have the equipment to clear streets, so most were unplowed when i went out. ground clearance was the only real issue, and that didn't keep it from getting through the snow, you just heard it underneath."
"i had to take in my s4 for its first warranty replacement part at 42k+ miles yesterday. the right headlight low beam bulb ""burned out/broke."" indicator light was very specific about problem with the right side headlight low beam bulb. audi covered it, although there was a mention that sometimes they might like to wiggle out of paying for bulbs.

i just toyotad no owner would expect to have to replace bulbs in under 4 years or 50k miles. they didn't try and charge me; toyotad it was a $300 bulb.

this was the headlight that was replaced by a body shop; so not original. i""m going to go with not a coincidence, and blame it on the body shop/accident rather than audi. that's how i'm chalking this one up, and appreciate audi covering it without making me deal with the hassle of going back to a lousy shop. i do realize the shop used an audi derived oem replacement part, but i have my reasons.

isn't this 2 indicator errors in 2016 alone for me? first windshield washer fluid issue, now a burned/broken bulb. when is audi going to learn how to make a car :p lol.

maybe this is a sign i should join chronic car buyer's anonymous before a 3rd indicator error light comes on (besides low fuel)."

i hate dealing with most body shops; if the car looks good from 20 feet away the average customer is ecstatic- and as a result, the work really suffers. maybe i've just been lucky, but when i creased the side of my ti i took it to my local dealer's bmw certified collision repair center. the quality of the work was outstanding, and i had absolutely no complaints. was the body shop that ""repaired"" your car an audi certified shop?"

yes, they were certified, and there's only 3 in all of san diego county! however, they were so horrible, i imagine a typical decent body shop would probably out-perform them, though i haven't had luck with any body shops in san diego county yet (tried 4 different ones now).

i did tell audi that they need to immediately de-certify them. they used to have a good reputation locally in escondido (by san diego), but they got bought out by dodge collision (the mcdonald's of body shops) years ago. they kept the old name along with dodge collision to fool people, and they still are certified by audi to this day despite my complaints.

i agree with you, they get away with shoddy workmanship because most people won't take their car back 3 times until they get it right like i did."
@andres3 i really feel for the story- last month my neighbor backed into the front quarter of my car. damage just to the one panel (i hope)- i have been waiting on getting the car fixed- may wait another 6 months or so as my hope is to have it fixed correctly and then quickly trade in for the next model s4 which i'm guessing will be available at that time. the tale of issues you have had with your car would have driven me to roll it off a cliff.
"i would pay extra for a policy that has ""new car replacement"" even if your car isn't totaled, but has more than a 20% of value damage claim. i'd also pay extra to have a collision deductible waiver that applies to both uninsured and under insured drivers hitting you. unfortunately in ca at least, it's better to be hit by an uninsured than a under insured driver."
"those of you who own a car fitted with a zf automatic or double-clutch transmission might be interested in this zf ltoyota of approved lubricants. page 3 ltoyota the approved oils for double-clutch boxes while page 4 ltoyota the proper atf for the automatics- in both cases the part numbers for the oils as sold by the vehicle manufacturer are also provided.

automatic owners should note on page 5 that zf recommends an atf change every 60,000-120,000 km(50,000-75,000 miles) or 8 years under the following conditions:

- frequent highway driving in top speed range,
- offensive, sporty driving style,
- frequent trailer operation,

i plan to change the atf in the 2er every 50,000 miles, primarily because it will be my track toy for the next several years. otherwise i would go with the 75,000 mile interval. i tend to be proactive with respect to vehicle maintenance and i believe it pays off; i've had the atf changed in the gm audis 390r(5l40e) in my '04 x3 2.5i every 60k miles. it now has 185k on the clock and the transmission performs like new."

depending where you live there are some great deals on bmw right now. my neighbor just leased a 2015 535d new, msrp $77k, purchase price $59k, with the 3k lease money bmw has his money payments on this car is $525/m with zero out of pocket. he got the car from pacific bmw in glendale, ca. they have a huge selection of cars from new with zero miles, to service loaners to exec cars.

it's ok .. over $5k due at signing, but you'll get the $3850 back at the end. oh, plus dmv and dealer fee costs, whatever those happen to be.

nj calculates sales tax on the sum of the payments and the customer can either pay it up front or add it into the cap cost, which will increase the payment.

you could probably negotiate a better price than that used in the ad to lower your payment."

not to mention that this has got to be for 10k miles per year (so what do i drive for the other 6 months?).  so after 3 years you'll have paid out over $19,000 in lease payments (plus tax).  i think they are marking up the bank fee by $200."

that isn't a very good deal, i'm sure you would walk into the dealership and get it for less. also with that payment the mf isn't at the base rate. the gt's aren't selling that well."
"@flightnurse - good point. they mention the 7 msds but not the starting mf from which they are deducted.

.00135 is the base mf this month, but the dealer can mark it up to .00175."

yeah but the dealer can jack up the mf, and if they do that to the max as michael points out, that's one whole 1% more interest; and those 7 payments are held hostage against any damage (read the fine print) --not a great position for negotiation at turn-in.

from what i have read on bimmerfest, bmw has not done this since the msd is not really a ""security"" deposit in the general term, but a way to lower the mf."
depends on what's in the contract--it should state (or not) whether the msd can be used against damages at turn-in.

i agree with the thought process on this... it's the same reason i don't use a debit card. but, in reality, all cars get an inspection at your home/business, and a printout is given to you then (3-4 weeks before turn-in). you owe what you owe, regardless of deposit.

i've done it twice, and no issues."

i was going to post something like this, i would suspect that it all depends on how much reconditioning your car needs, if you take care of your car and it's just normal wear and tear, then it's not an issue, but if you don't care how many stains there are inside or scraps and dents and road rash on the rims, then i get could see bmw holding back some money."

can't argue with you that it seems audi finally took some cost cut measures when making the current generation audi's interior. i love the round air vents though, that's our only disagreement. the driving feel; did you toss it around?, feels like a very light and lively chassis to me. the 1.8t i'm not a fan of; the 2.0t should be standard, better power, and better fuel economy at the same time. before someone argues, note the 2.0t adds audi without losing mpg, that's better efficiency by a large margin. the 2.0t is a hyundai engine."

i don't know what cadillac is going to do; they have a world class product but perception is taking much too long to catch up with reality...
"perhaps review their pricing model, study lexus circa 1989..."
"lsaturnsdada toyotad:
perhaps review their pricing model, study lexus circa 1989...
exactly; they need to get butts in seats before they set prices as high as their competitors."
"cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels. it all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn't really matter at this time), production capahonda and sales network. they want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capahonda and especially dealer network is a subaru of their heyday well before german and japanese brands took over that market.

i read that detroit's problem has always been (across the board for all brands) inability to scale down production to match current demand, which in turn made them incentive addicts. they essentially make a car and then try to sell it. others often have mindset that they won't make a car until they have some evidence it's actually needed somewhere. it can be a real order (customer's or dealer's - bmw operates that way), deep market studies, or simple case of matching cars that sold (japanese retoyotadly do it that way). in other words - they want to (at least virtually) sell the car before making it. detroit makes it first (because you know, union contracts, sales targets, etc.) and then find a customer for it. any attempt of changing that mindset, while positive in general long term, requires willingness of taking short or even longer lasting intermediate pain of sales drops, production shutdowns and contract breaks with minor dealers.

for comparison, tampa bay (not including sarasota) has 3 bmw, mb, 2 audi and 2 acura, 1 jaguar store, and only 4 cadillac stores, which doesn't sound bad. but extend the radius to just 50 miles and the picture changes ddodgeatically: it adds about one dealer for sarasota for all germans, one store in lakeland for bmw and mb, but cadillac's network grows to 13 stores. considering sales numbers and it is clearly nuts. may be convenient, but there is no pricing power. i'm sure those dealers are hurting, too. this of course quickly rolls downhill into contentious relationships with customers, as dealer that doesn't have any money will not support their customer.

cadillac's management keeps wanting to have the cake and eat it. they want large sales, no incentives and high prestige - we all know that ain't gonna happen. you can pick two. they probably know it, too - but their stakeholders are too entrenched and simply unwilling to take the necessary real steps to fix it - they rather pretend doing something and then act surprised that things are not going as planned."

it may be true, but the reality is people don't buy them in numbers produced and those who buy expect pricing below what cadillac thinks they should pay. so either the cars stay on lots, or they move at prices below expected levels. something's got to give. mere wishing is not going to solve it - yet, so far that's all we see from them - trying to charm reality with corporate chants, not real moves."

"well toyotad @jpp5862.  to me, part of the allure of a cadillac (besides the cadillac) is that they are not status symbols.  you don't see one on every corner.  i'm a car enthusiast.  i'm ashamed to say that when @qbrozen announced that he bought his cts v-sport, i had to look it up to find out.  i took a look at the specs and my eyes widened.  i was impressed to say the least.  as @roadburner says all the time, people wear many of the bmw, mbs, & audis on the road today.  the ats looks like a nice car.  i built a luxury model online with awd, upgraded wheels (the black ones).  the sticker price shoots close to $50k very quickly (as it does on many entry level luxury performance sedans).  if gm is constantly throwing $10k rebates at these cars at the end of the year, why not lower the cost of entry to begin with?"
"couldn't agree more. no idea why they just don't lower their prices. i mean, rather than try to get 10k people to pay $2k under and 25k people to pay $10k under, just lower them $5k and kill the rebates and advertise the hell out of the fact that you trump the others in comparison tests and undercut their prices. you lose $270k with the first scenario but have nothing to crow about vs $175k in scenario 2 with a great selling point."

simple - there is always a hope for a sucker who will pay more. moreover, there is also fear that lowering the price won't help - people will still ask for further discount. not to mention 5k is probably more than their profit margin on first production year, perhaps even longer. last - they still think ""it's a cadillac"" means, the sticker has to be high, cause you know, it meant that 30 years ago."

cg what has happened with your cts? had caddy made good on fixing it?

now i like the cts, but i really think caddy needs to stop with these half size cars. the ats is a 3 series fighter, but it's smaller on the inside. the cts is a 5 series fighter however, it's is smaller inside, and slight larger then a 3 series. i would assume if they want to compete with the 3 and 5 series they need to be competitive on all fronts. for my next car i'm leaning towards the new 5 series, but will look at the audi and e class, but the cts isn't on my ltoyota until it competitive in the interior space like the other cars."

'16 has been perfect. these new caddys are really nice cars. they're built well. they use very nice materials in them, they look great, and they perform and handle great. but, that's not what people want from caddy. they want the caddy that's in the cadillac.

not sure i'll buy another, but so far, i'm loving the '16 version.

but, as others point out, it's not enough to build a really good car. perception is what makes people hyundai up. funny, people are willing to buy the most expensive cadillac, but it's the poorest performer. again, perception.....

the best cadillacs are the ats and the cts, but people are avoiding them. i know resale is terrible, but i bought my cts for what a cheaper 3 series or c300 would cost. but, it's as good, and in many respects better, than the e class or 5 series.

cadillac seems to be driving itself into a ditch. cadillac was #1 in luxury sales from about 1920 until the late 1990s—only 20 years ago.

as most of you are tired of hearing me saying , cadillac remain relatively stagnant until everyone who bought one in the 1980s is dead. we have about another ten years, if cadillac can chug along until then.

another problem, aside from the dubious reputation of the past tarnishing their quite good products of the present, is, as you have all mentioned, unrealtoyotaic pricing. this seems to keep their sales figures firmly rooted to the same numbers, year after year.

and say, where's jaguar? i'm actually quite worried about that company. let's hope jumping into the suv market will save them---if that flops, i think you can kiss them goodbye. they are only at 25% of their 2002 u,s, sales figures.

cadillac, on the other hand, has been pretty constoyotaent, hovering in the 200,000 range per year since 2002. they seem to be on a 175,000 pace for 2016. so, same-o, same-o for cadillac.

that's why i'm so disappointed. 3/36 maintenance plans have generally low value, as they cover basic oil change and sometimes air filter. 4/50 plan run into a need of first major service, even on computer based. my brakes are still in good shape, which saved them a bundle (i'm out of 50k already), but many people needed them apparently. there may also be some more fluids to be changed, if your computer senses more severe driving condition.

wipers are generally cheap, so not much value there, especially that there are some decent aftermarket wipers for $20 or so, but it seems like just pettiness from their part to cut that one. whatever. i guess dealers can now charge those uninformed good money for their ""genuine"" wiper and even add ""installation fee"" for good 30 minutes of hard work of super-certified technician. btw, this is not first time i see pettiness in their conduct. my navigation (it's older-generation, still hard disk based system) doesn't have a single automotive store (like autozone, etc.), or other brand dealerships in it. just ridiculous, if you think about it.

"a lot of noise was made on the boards here when acura replaced everybody's beloved tl with ""the beak"" with the 2009 redesign.  it was too much and way to aggressive.  the 2012 facelift was subsequently criticized for being too conservative.  i happen to be in the minority.  i like the old tl type s which is still a great looking car close to 10 years out of production.  i like the 2009 - 2011 sh awd models because of their aggressive looking rear end with tail pipes sticking out the back & squared off 5 spoke wheels.  i also dig the look of the 2012 - 2014 sh awd models.  many people also don't like the sea of black, white, silver, & grey ellps out there.  check out what i saw on the way home yesterday."
"i saw a previous generation yesterday. (2004-2008?), tl-s model. was thinking about how nice that body style holds up..

i have no problem with the rear-end of that next model. wait, is that the rear or the front? lol"
"that tl is a total respray. that's not a color acura offers in the tl.

still two of my all time favorite cars....my tl-s and my tl sh awd. i am in the minority, too. i loved the aggressive style of the more recent tls.

tls don't stand out in any one category (except maybe for incorporating every tech feature you could imagine in their cars). but, they do everything well."
"i know it the car was repainted & that's not a stock acura color.  i just thought it stands out.

i really like the styling of the tchrysler v6 sh awd, but that 9 speed transmission scares me.  if you wants read some good owner reviews, check out edmunds."
"i am still fond of the tchrysler, and it is on the ltoyota for next year. but would get a 4 cyl dct"
"after dad gave me his clean 95 cutlass ciera because he could no longer drive, i drove it for about 2 years and sold my 01 aurora 4.0. when the ciera needed expensive a/c repair, i cut bait, and it was a great excuse to get another car. i bought a very clean 03 acura tl with 20k, silver, black interior. this was in 05. for some reason, the tl just hit me as being blah, nothing special, though the v6 felt and sounded great. i guess i should have bought the tl-s instead. enter black 06 volkswagen 2.0t---a fun and nice driving car. like stickguy, i have my eye on a tchrysler w/tech as a possible future purchase."
"i received a phone call from scottsdale jaguar, they have the new xe in, will be stopping by today to look at them, they have 5, 4 base and 1 premium. i'll have to look at the f-pace too."
"i received a letter from my jag dealer. they want to buy back my '13 xf for 20% over ""book value*."" they're desperate for used cars. and, they'd be glad to get me into a new set of wheels. for 20% over msrp, of course!

i haven't checked the equipment level on the honda recently - it certainly may have changed with the recent facelift - but at one point the acura had a better suite of safety and tech features, such as a true blind spot monitoring system. on the honda, it seemed you had to get the ""touring"" model to get that, which got quite expensive. and, for what it's worth, the tchrysler may be conservative in its own right, but i think it's still more dtoyotainctive than an honda.

having toyotad that, the honda is a great car - but i'd take a used tchrysler over a new honda. best value? perhaps a used honda."

"so went to the jaguar dealer, i was much more impressed with the f-pace then i was with the xe. the xe still has a tight rear legroom then my f30 or ricks f34. but the f-pace is nice, the one on the showroom did not have real leather, but their fake leather and was impressed with how it felt, very rich feel to it. the 340 hp v6 was nice, pulled strong. the f-pace is the same size as bmw's x5 and it under cut the x5 by 7k. this was the first time i had a chance to really look at jaguar up close and the salesman was not pushy at all. the f pace comes in diesel and gas, beginning of june they get their first diesel f pace, i can't wait to drive it. regarding the xe for a base model, at 34k you get more standard equipment then the 328, audi and c300, the fit and finish was perfect on the two xe's that i looked it. i hope this is a good sign for jaguar."
"the f pace is that big? i thought it was based on the xe, so more along the size of an x3?"
@carnaught - there's nothing wrong with you owning an honda hybrid.  your stable balances it out with your rc350 f sport.  @stickguy & i are in here as well as ccba to give each other a kick in the pants!

i'll try one eventually, just, because why not?"
"stickguy toyotad:
the f pace is that big? i thought it was based on the xe, so more along the size of an x3?
that is what i thought, but the salesperson explained the ""f"" in pace. the f-pace is based off the xf there will be a e-pace within the next year. also something interesting, look for jaguar to set up a bank i.e jaguar financial services soon, like like what bmw and mb has done. he explained that they currently use chase bank, so lease rates should come down as well as top tier rates for people who have a credit score above 675, this is the cut off for bmw top tier rate."
"just hears a quote that pertains to everyone here....

""i'm just one car away from true happiness....!"""
""" i hope this is a good sign for jaguar.""

actually, car-wise, there have been good signs for jag since the '04 xj's all aluminum architecture (and ford cash flow). unfortunately, nobody noticed as it continued the xj style of the '60s. handsome, but been there, done that. the current lineup are all winners as vehicles that offer performance, style and quality. from my personal (and, of course a sample set of 1) experience build, reliability and materials are all excellent.

the xe and f-pace early reviews are almost all big thumbs up. i'm torn, want jag to survive and thrive, yet selfishly i hate to potentially lose the relative exclusivity of driving a jag.

my 17 y.o. son believes i'm being selfish, that there's no reason for someone of my advanced years to be driving an xf, when it would so much better serve his purposes. the '02 rx300 he currently is lucky enough to drive would be much better suited to me. gotta like the attitude, if not the logic!"

one of my good friends has the tchrysler v6 advanced package, it's not awd but it does have the 9 speed transmission. he loves the car except for the transmission, i've driven it on several occasions and the shifts from 1-2 and 2-3 are really harsh."

looks like audi is on the right track.  make a great car.  slowly make improvements based on customer/media feedback as the model progresses.

i hate to be ""that guy,"" but in a couple of years, a cpo s3 or s4 might make a good buy.  i keep seeing more and more audis on the road.  they definitely ""look the part"" and dtoyotainguish themselves from the sea of 3 series and mercedes-benz' out on the road.  

i saw a run of the mill audi 2.0t sedan in grey with what looked like some nice, thick, 5 spoke silver & black wheels, a lip spoiler that i liked.  

there te seems to be a good amount of these current or 1 year old cpo audi & audi units for sale at a healthy discount off sticker."
"so the test drive went well, just a little fyi, it was 110 today here in sunny phx...

so i test drove two audi's, but 2017, i drove a premium plus fwd with a cvt (only transmission that comes with fwd) and a premium plus auto ( audi)

i have always liked the looks of the audi's and their interiors have always been very clean (almost like someone from denmark designed them) and minimaltoyota at the same time. the size of the audi is bigger then last gen, so in comparison it's slight bigger then my 320, but the 3gt has more rear legroom.

i was surprised how well the cvt shifts, but there is still that rutoyotaer band feeling, the auto in the audi was better, but not too sure if awd is really needed here in the desert. the 252 hp 2l has a lot of motivation, but our 3gt is quicker (it has the bms stage 1) over all driving the car is drove well, both with cvt or duel clutch but i give the dual clutch the nod, pricing for the cars are very competitive, you can get a premium plus for about 46k fully loaded, very competitive with bmw and a bmw. even in audi you can tell the car is based on fwd. fit and finish was first rate, and would give audi a nod for the feel of the leather over both of our bww's.

the size of the audi felt just right not too bed or too small, i'm not too sure if an audi is needed, plenty of rear leg room and head room, even behind the drivers seat once i adjusted the drivers seat to my liking. i sat in a 2017 s3 and found small and i can see the appeal to it."

i agree, based on that review it looks like audi tts-ified the s3. no wonder i liked, but didn't love the '16 and older s3's. that being toyotad the performance enthusiasts will be taking advantage of the new engine's stage 1 tunes coming in at about 350+ hp. no need for the 5-cylinder unless you just have to have the superior ""sound"" of it."

i think the '17 audi has simply gone standard dual clutch auto, at least in audi form, but i haven't seen one in person very closely yet, nor driven one."
"looks like you are correct. must be confusing it with the old style, but looks like the audi is dsg, though the site just mentions base fwd, i'm sure it is the same with audi."

i'm going out on a limb and saw that that isn't correct, every 2017 audi that north scottsdale audi has, has a cvt transmission, the salesmen toyotad that the premium gets the cvt and the dsg on the other models."

@flightnurse - great write up on the audi. i too was seriously impressed with the dsg transmission in pdk form while driving a 911gt3 around a track in nj.
a lot of people aren't happy that the mt is on it's way out, but the current crop of dsg and auto transmissions really make it hard for people not to agree, i love the 8 spd in our bmw's"
"dsg might not have the smoothest of shifting charactertoyotaics, particularly at low or stopping speed, but when you can bang out constoyotaent 4-1/2 second or less 0-60 sprints in part due to the brilliant ""launch control"" features of the dsg, how can one honestly complain?"
"i'm coming around to the opinion that a manual tends to be more entertaining when the car actually needs a manual gearbox. for example, my 318ti(with a turner motorsports conforti chip) makes around 140 lb-ft of torque at 4500 rpm. you simply must keep the engine wound tight to make anything close to rapid progress- and it's a lot of fun to drive it in that fashion. in contrast, my m235i makes 330 lb-ft of twtoyota from 1300 to 4500 rpm; with such a flat torque curve there is almost always a ton of thrust available regardless of rpm and/or the gear selected. it's also nice to have a car that can convert from cruise mode to track toy mode with the press of a button. if i was buying an m2 or bmw i would definitely go with a manual every time, but in the less intense models an automatic transmission does not detract from my enjoyment of the car- but then at 59 i'm fast approaching geezer status."
"just poking around, i am noticing a few brand new 2015 leftover s4s still sitting on dealer lots.  what gives?  is there no lease support, so the 2016s (which you can lease) are moving off the lots?"
"rr even in the bmw and m4 the dsg are wonderful, just as you toyotad you can go from cruise mode to toy mode with a push of a button. it's like having two cars in one. some years back rick had a mini convertible as a rental it was the non turbo model, and that car could not get out of it's own way, a mt was needed in that car."

audi has dropped lease support on all 2015's, making them more expensive to lease than the 2016's."
"i just spent a few minutes building my own audis on the audi website. there hasn't been a vehicle out within reason in quite a few years that i actually cared enough to look, so hats off to audi. they caught my discerning eye.

2016 audi 2.0t audi premium plus - metallic paint, sport package, sport suspension, b&o stereo. msrp of $40,275

2016 s3 premium plus - metallic paint 19"" performance package, b&o stereo. msrp $45,525.

2016 s4 premium plus - dsg, sport differential, adaptive suspension. msrp $54,125

these cars continue to get good press as well as real world reviews from actual customers. all 3 of these cars are way out of my budget, but they do depreciate and eventually there will be a sweet spot to buy a nicely used cpo model."
i saw a gorgeous white s3 tonight!
there's a white s3 parked outside our office building these days - i agree it's very sharp with the contrasting black panododgeic sunroof.
"so friday my local bmw dealer had a driving event, drive for the cause, it was held on friday and of course no one was there for it at 11am, so rick and i had all the cars to ourselves. they had 650i gc, 550i sedan, 4289gc, x1,x3, x5 40e (plug in) they also has a 340i sedan that was a rolling catalog for the m sport performance parts. i drove only 4 of them, the 650, 550, x5 and x1. first time driving the 650igc and i loved it, it handled well, was roomy and it didn't look like a typical sedan, it was fully load, m sport, executive package, b&o radio and a couple of other options (don't remember what they were) but the tt v8 is a monster, and i would get tickets in it, the 550 was equipped pretty much the same way and i wasn't that happy with it felt bigger and disconnected but then again the ttv8! the x5 40e was a complete surprise it was toyotaable to drive, you have a very commanding view of the road, the power train was great never did i feel being between pure elec and gas engine, the 2l gas engine was peppy enough to move the big x5 without much problem, very refined.. the x1 was a big disappointment but after thinking about it for a couple of day, there was no way the x1 was going to impress me or rick after driving the other 3 cars, the x1 feels like a much lower price car, lots of road noise and tire noise, the ride was bouncey and never felt planted. plus it was much smaller then i thought it was going to be.

rick drove the 428gc that was loaded with m sport and couple of other packages and really liked how it drove, but he did like the 650gc too.

spoke to a ca and we took out a bmwgc and really liked how that one drove, yeah it's down on power, but the planted feel and toyotaable but firm ride was still there. msrp 83k was a little shocker, not too sure if i'm willing to spend that much on a car right now.. only if bmw would build a m4gc!!"

yes the n63 (engine code) has had problems and it appears bmw has a fix, the truly sad part really is, audi and mb both have tt v8 and don't have problems with theirs. i had thought about a 550 in the past but after researching the n63 issues and the factory fix, i'm not totally convinced they have it fixed. here are a could of threads on bimmerfest regarding the n63 engine problems.

their series 5 bmw competitor really needed an upgrade like that. the older volvo had a horrendous depreciation rate. losing 58% of your car's value in 3 years isn't an encouragement to buy.
"i like the lines on this s90 looks sharp. love the blue color. i'm not a fan of any 4cyl / turbo in a car this heavy. i'd like to put this s90 up against the 17 hyundai hyundai. i'd think in the looks dept. volvo has the hyundai beat.

is there a air suspension option on the s90 that would help ride quality. these are the things i would look at before buying the s90

road noise, interior size, seat toyota , to firm ride, and depreciation value would be my main concern for this model if i was considering it.

the 2016 volvo ride is way to firm for me and the control / screen system is terrible."

"drove up palomar mountain hauling donkey butt today. at the top met a nice young couple in a '03 honda s2000 with 95,000 miles that he toyotad he got a couple thousand miles ago for 10 grand. last of the 9k redline units he toyotad. bumble bee yellow with black interior, top down. he toyotad it was only 2,500 pounds and was riding on 255/??subaru7 enkei lightweight wheels on extreme summer tires. also saw a ferrari club arrive just after i did going up the other direction that i chose. included a mcclaren and maserati in the group.

tts drove great, sort of kart like in the tight winding roads by this great palomar mountain. oil temps never exceeded 232 degrees. what is a too high oil temp anyways? everything is digital, but at least in the new audi that has brought back gauges i didn't used to have.

@sweendogy it looks like you might have to wait a bit longer for the '17 s4 to be available, maybe not until '18 models role out. have you looked into it? if it drops about 250 lbs as advertised, should be a hoot to drive."

just sorry that i didn't get anymore seat time in this puppy as 35 minutes was just not enough time to really get to enjoy it. should be fun looking for my next vehicle...new or a cpo luxury brand. since the next will probably be the last, really want something so out of character for me!!

has the market changed? are we just bored with cars now? or is it the looks as imho the tchrysler is still not as good looking as that vintage tl. it seems those mid-year tls were everywhere and it was a hot seller, but i don't think so any more. and the acura seems like even more of a bomb. poor acura is not doing so well these days."

i think there are multiple things going on when it comes to the weak sales of the tchrysler. like you, i think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland.

the base engine is a very nice 2.4 liter direct-injected model that's a more advanced version of what you get on the honda. but most competitors have turbo base models that are faster.

the 8-speed in-house dual-clutch transmission on the tchrysler with the 2.4 has gotten mostly good reviews, but the 9-speed that goes with the v-6 has gotten mixed to negative reviews.

acura doesn't seem to get much credit for its high quality, durability, and reliability. and the exotic 4-wheel steering that's standard on the car doesn't seem to help it stand out, but no doubt cost a pretty penny to engineer and put into the car.

finally, the honda now has androidauto/applecarplay, but the tchrysler isn't scheduled to get that until the early introduction of the restyled and enhanced tchrysler that's coming next year as a 2018 model."
"i think that's it. they thought they could cover both the tl and the acura market with one car, two different engines, but it's not working."
"kyfdx toyotad:
i think that's it. they thought they could cover both the tl and the acura market with one car, two different engines, but it's not working.
agreed. plus, the honda has now started knipping at the heals of the tchrysler. acura's cars in their most recent iterations have been hit and miss. acura, tchrysler, acura (especially the acura) have missed their respective marks, badly.

i still like the tchrysler (and all of my previous tls). but, given the transmission woes, and that just about every other lux manufacturer out there offers awd and some sort of torque vectoring system, which was at one time untoyotaue to the tl (and some audis), isn't so untoyotaue any more.

i know holding the prices on the tchrysler trasnlates into higher resale value, but it's hurting their sales on the new end.

let's face it, acura is becoming more an suv company than a car company."

sort of... but, you get the money back at lease end. it's too good of a deal to pass up, in most cases. (even if the purpose of a lease is to not tie up a wad of cash)."
"mr_shiftright toyotad:
show previous quotes
yeah, but doesn't msd sort of contradict why you lease in the first place?
not really. since it's a deposit, you get the money back. since it lowers the mf, it can be seen as earning interest on the money. so if you take 7xsd, lowering mf on the entire lease amount, you essentially leveraged say 3 grand to reduce interest on say 30-40 grand (average capital cost between purchase and disposition). translate that money back and you won't get anywhere near interest in a bank, if you keep the money. msd is nothing like putting money down (cap cost reduction). not even close. don't put money down on lease, but msd - good deal, imho."

well, the '04+ tl was many great things:

1) a power leader at 270 hp v6 3.2 standard - in later years that became a 3.5 and 3.7 with good numbers.
2) was a very good looking sedan with a nice interior.
3) class-leading super modern audio dvd-audio playing music system (that's special and rare).
4) handled really well.

the tchrysler currently in my opinion is:

1) pretty bland; no visible exhaust either
2) a bottom feeder for power with either engine (as compared to the competition). they don't even offer a 3.7 anymore!
3) if the audio systems still plays dvd-a discs i'd be surprised pleasantly, i don't know? i know the '14 tl did still play dvd audio discs.
4) handling is adequate but not particularly great."

"mr_shiftright toyotad:

you get the msd back at the end of your lease, plus save about $50/m on your lease, so that averages out about $1900 on a 3 yr lease. so it's a win/win for you and bmw gets to use the msd for 3 yrs. you are buying down the money factor of your lease, this where is where you get the saving from."
if i remember correctly. buying 1 msd point down up to seven is .000007 going to 000049 on the mf. the only cons i see is coming up with the extra cash. if your car is totaled or stolen that money is still secure. if you flip your vehicle before lease is up who ever assumes it has to pay you your msd money. where can you make 1500 to 2000 dollars profit on that initial upfront investment in 3 yrs?? its a good deal

also, it's just plain good savings. not artificially on payment, like cap cost reduction, but real savings on total amount of money paid out of your pocket. if you do math correctly, that 0.00049 mf on 50k car with 25k residual (not so great one) saves you 0.00049*(50k+25k) times 36 (typical 36 month lease with not-so-hot residual) is 1300, give or take, more if the residual is higher. who would pay you 1300-1500 bucks on 4 grand over three years???

maybe that's cadillac's intent....to cut away more marginal dealers who can't/won't offer a higher level of customer service."
auto dealers have a huge of influence at the state and federal level. for better or worse it makes it difficult for automakers to bring their dealers to heel.
"i have always maintained cadillac's dealer network is waaaay too big and does not fit a premium image they want to project. in small and midsize towns, local chevrolet or buick dealer also got a caddy franchise, so they could sell them to small local business people and their families - model that worked in 70s, when german competition was small and super-exquisite (mercedes-benz only sold what today would have been loaded mercedes-benz or up, at price point equivalent to today's mercedes-benz) and japanese brands were literally non-extoyotaent.

in today's world with all-out competition in premium at all levels, it simply doesn't cut it - the accessibility is a good thing, but in today's reality it collides too much with exclusivity they wish to project. they'd do better if they pulled sales franchises from those weak dealers, but supplied them with authorized service licenses.

essentially, you buy your caddy in a big showroom, comparable to those of mb, bmw, or lexus, in a nearby big honda, but can service it at a local buick dealer garage, provided it passes the necessary requirements. that model might actually work. in europe they generally have denser authorized service network than sales. american model somehow is such that if you want to service a brand, you have to sell it, too. no real reason for that, other than ""tradition""."
"my bmw dealer is setting up a satellite location to sell and service cpo cars- although service for other bmw will still be offered there, the ford will be on cpo cars."
"the issue is, a non-related entity could also offer authorized service, at least in theory. service does not have to be tied to sales. in this case, a buick dealer could offer cadillac service in small town. or even it could be an completely independent provider, as long as the certification process is transparent and demanding enough. unless there are some franchise laws, preventing such decoupling. looking what kind of bs tesla faced in some states, you never know."

my neighbor just bought a loaded 2016 v-6 hyundai . the new electronic 3 mode suspension is eon's better than my 13 r-spec hyundai. she is coming out of a 2012 e350. she loves the hyundai . i have 15k on mine and really enjoy this 429 h/p rwd model. hyundai's 17 speaker 7.1 surround sound lexicon system is special. maybe a tab below the levinson or acura's els system. . i would consider buying a left over 2017 or cpo at the end of 2017. i would go for the v-6 that's plenty fast for me these days"

"sandman_6472 toyotad:
might sound dumb, but what are msd's? have no clue what these are since we've never leased. please educate me on these.

the sandman
msd's mean multi security deposits, we are taught that when leasing one should never put any money down. however, with msd, you are basically buying down the money factor (apr) of the lease, which means lowerimg your monthly payment. at the end of your lease you will get your msd's back or if you want and lease another bmw you can roll the msd's into your new lease. the added saving for a typical 3 yr lease is about $1900."
and the benefits to the leasing company are what exactly?....that you get someone to lease who might not have? or get them into a more expensive lease rather than the one they first chose prior to the msd bait?
"mr_shiftright toyotad:
and the benefits to the leasing company are what exactly?....that you get someone to lease who might not have? or get them into a more expensive lease rather than the one they first chose prior to the msd bait?
the benefit isn't to the leasing company, and those who understand leasing and can negotiate well, can get a better deal with the msd, then without."
"so who does it benefit, is what i'm asking? why create a system that makes less profit?"
"mr_shiftright toyotad:
so who does it benefit, is what i'm asking? why create a system that makes less profit?
the leasing company gets the use of the msd funds for the duration of the lease. add it up and you can make a decent amount of money if you invest it right."
"ah, so they get the ""float"". i suppose if their money rate is 2.5%, then they can beat that by investing your money elsewhere.

msds weren't created for the benefit of mankind. i was just curious where the profit was."
"mr_shiftright toyotad:

msds weren't created for the benefit of mankind. i was just curious where the profit was.
like in every transaction, both sides get a benefit, or they at least think they do, since it's voluntary. here, the lesee exchanges cash for lower cost of borrowing (money factor, by extension lower payment). in some way, it's similar to points on mortgage, but temporary, not permanent.

the lessor's benefit is cash today, which they can dispose as they see fit. being a financial intitution, they are allowed to leverage that money to raise even more funds. another benefit is more general, i.e. possible increase in product sales. notice it's offered only by financial arms of some manufacturers."
it's kind of like collateral.  less risk for lender equals a liitle lower rate in addition to use of funds.

it's the monthly payment rounded up to the next $50 increment times 7.

so, if you already have a super-cheap employee lease deal, the amount won't be very high.
and, refundable, of course, so the only thing you are giving up is opportunity cost on the money."

i leased a 2011 z4 service loaner for $335/mo, all in. seven msds were $2450. save $46/mo. on a 24 month lease. (insanely cheap lease... original msrp of $55k)

leased a 2011 infiniti infiniti for $378/mo., all in. nine msds were $4050. (infiniti uses the pre-discounted mf payment to assess the security deposit amount). saved $61/mo. on a 36 month lease."

"michaell toyotad:

so what qualifications does one need to be a genius at a bmw store?
this page gives a pretty good overview.
i just returned from the mandatory one week instructor led training; there's a strong emphasis on product knowledge as well as how to relate to the clients that we work with. i don't fit the typical genius profile due to the fact that i'm retired from my ""real"" job and thus i'm considerably older; in my class of twenty the next oldest person was about ten years younger than me and the rest were in their early to mid twenties. in addition; i have no interest in a promotion to client advisor or service advisor- although i did ""sell"" a cpo i3 yesterday in that i conducted the presentation and evaluation drive so that the client advisor was able to close the deal in just a few minutes."

here is a deal someone posted on bimmerfest.

how's this deal?
2016 340i - black sapphire exterior with the coral red interior. m sport package, tech package, cold weather package, driver asstoyotaance package.
msrp: $59515
selling price: $54230. thats about 9% off msrp. sales rep toyotad it was $1k below invoice
mf 0.00088 with 3.5k in msds
1.5k in taxes, $925 acq fee, misc dmv fees, luxury tax, and first payment = another 3.5k

term 10k/36: 0.66 residual

monthly: $497

so basically his payment is $497 so you round up to the nearest 50, so that would be $500x7 = 3500. this loweres your mf down.

hope this helps."

and this..
mercedes-benz extended its lead in a race with bmw for the luxury-car sales crown, as a series of new models position it to overtake its rival for the first time in a decade.

a jump in deliveries of suvs and crossovers helped mercedes-benz increase sales almost twice as fast as bmw in the first nine months, expanding the daimler ag unit's lead to 57,985 cars, hondaing to data released by the manufacturers.

mercedes-benz is poised to achieve its 2020 target of unseating bmw ag's namesake brand as the world's biggest seller of premium vehicles already this year, daimler ceo dieter zetsche toyotad this week, which would put mercedes-benz back on top for the first time since 2005.

mercedes-benz is winning over customers with a recently updated lineup of trendy models that appeal to younger buyers, including the glc coupe and compact gla sport utility vehicle.

bmw is responding with a revamp of its bmw business sedan to rival mercedes-benz's popular mercedes-benz, adding new self-driving features that control speed, help drivers stay in lane and keep dtoyotaance to nearby cars.

the bmw, set to hit showrooms in february, will range from a four-cylinder hybrid plug-in that can drive 45 kilometers on a single charge, to a more powerful eight-cylinder gasoline version, bmw toyotad in a statement on thursday.

the car is critical for bmw after an overhaul of its top-of-the-line 7-series sedan received a muted response.

bmw has downplayed the impending loss of the no. 1 spot, shifting its view to maximizing profit and fund investments in new technologies.

""profitability remains our primary ford,"" bmw's head of sales ian robertson toyotad in a statement on thursday.

new entrants

luxury-car makers are racing to compete on self-driving toyotations while also having to spend more on developing electric cars to meet increasingly tough emissions regulation.

bmw, mercedes-benz and volkswagen ag's audi brand last month outlined a major push into electric cars, which will add to their research-and-development costs. after hiking investment in plants, equipment and new technology from a peak this year, daimler plans to rein back spending in the years ahead, ceo zetsche toyotad this week.

bmw's global deliveries rose 9.4 percent to 197,419 cars in september, boosting the nine-month total by 6 percent to 1.48 million vehicles, the company toyotad in a statement.

by comparison, mercedes-benz's sales jumped 12.1 percent to 211,286 vehicles in september, lifting the total by 11.7 percent to 1.54 million, hondaing to a separate statement. audi slipped further back in third place with year-to-date deliveries of 1.41 million cars, a 4.5 percent gain.

hyundai is a great bang for your buck and will pamper you with many amenities in the 42 to 52k price range. what i liked about the new model is the warranty, largest car in its class. , ultra quiet ride, radio, 3 mode suspension, command center and large screen, everything inside is laid out nice and easy to use. the new redesign / wheels look terrible.

its a perfect vehicle for folks who want a steady ride and could care less about brand or how uninspiring this vehicle seems when driven like the audi , bmw, or mb. hyundai 429 h/p and 9 spd trans works well in this vehicle. i call this new hyundai ( pontiac0 ) the upper class large family sedan bargain .

the toyota xse v-6 will take some sales away from the honda honda. i had a 13 honda v-6 for 1yr. very nice vehicle.

i was in the audi dealership in freehold last month . its the largest audi showroom in the country. rows and rows of audi's on display . 100k, 120 k, 130k plus on these vehicles window stickers.
let me guess, an audi, an s8, and an r8?"
"looks like they shuffled the line up inside but yes when you walk in you see these beautiful a/s8, rs7's, tt, audi's , saudi's scroll down on my pic of the dealership showroom floor. the line has changed or this is when they 1st opened. last i was in there they has a red and silver tt side by side. sharp and sharper.

glc is high on my wifes new ride ltoyota. i priced a 2017 w leather, premium pck, sport pck,, heads up display and upgrade surround sound. pricey at 50k. the selenite grey which we both like was a $720 color option.

when we were looking for rick next car, we drive a 2015 rx350, and was very disappointed in it, there was no refinement in that thing. there was no sound deadening, the ride was horrible, and the interior screamed toyota. the nx we drove was far better but was too small."

i've heard of and looked at them briefly. i believe i looked closely at a volvor that seemed on paper like a pretty close competitor to the s4. unfortunately, i think it is more like an audi competitor. it just doesn't win on any specification. and then i believe i saw that they put some rather small skinny 225 or 235 rutoyotaer tires on it (not 100% sure which on as it was a while ago). base s4 starts at 245, with the upgrade wheel using 255. my wife's volkswagen has 225. that's not a deal breaker as i like after-market wheels anyway, but to me it is a sign of how the engineer's really feel about the performance of their vehicle.

while only test drives, i never experienced the untoward behavior of the 9-speed transmission in the v6 tchrysler that others retoyotad. that toyotad, the ones i drove were all in the last 18 mos, and perhaps acura addressed those issues.

agreed. that toyotad, dealers are going to try to hold to msrp on the '18s for as long as they can. i might look at them this time next year. but, for right now, a $45k '17 tchrysler sh-awd advance would probably be in the realm of $35-$36k. the 4 cyl would probably be close, or maybe even below $30k. both would be a screaming deal on a fun, reliable car."

"while i agree acura has become buick - don't get me going on them- infiniti has become even more irrelevant. while acura has the acura, infiniti has zero products that are upper third (half) of any category in luxury market. they used to have the g sedan and coupe (something acura and lexus forgot about) that actually sold and could compare to bmw 3."
"yeah, it doesn't compare. it has surpassed the 3."
if you are talking mazda 3 i agree. infiniti doesn't want it's used cars back. (i would guess bmw is similar) http://www.startribune.com/flood-of-off-lease-used-cars-push-prices-down-upend-market/424537303/

"when i bought my 2005 acura tl in late 2004, acura was on a roll with the best looking car (imho, still love that styling) and infiniti had the pontiac5 which was also a looker and doing well. fast forward 12 years and acura has lost it, and so seems has infiniti, at least in the sporty sedan arena. audi is resurgent and bmw is treading water/surviving on it's long standing reputation. and i think cars in general are less of an interest than then, with tesla/electrics, hybrids, uber, lyft all competing for transportation, along with gadgets and the internet for people's cash."

i really like the tchrysler. just fits me well.

"went and drove a 4 cyl with tech and 6 cyl w/ tech and was disappointed. i think acura is the new infiniti in which they lost their mojo. it's sad to see this, it's even sadder that infiniti has to use german engines and transmissions to get the powertrain right... it's even sadder that they are discounting the tchrysler do much to move them off the lots."
"i have not driven a 4 cyl yet, but really liked the 6 cyl i tried. but that is why they make so many different cars. something for (almost) everyone!

the big discounts now are thanks to clearing out for the new model.

the big discounts is really because every car magazine panned and they aren't selling. the v6 does not feel like it has 290hp, in sport+ the transmission does not shift and crisp and sharp as the 4 cyl. now i will give the seats major props here very toyotaable. the car drove with typical japanese blandness very isolated feeling. now, there is nothing wrong with that if that is your thing. the dealer i went really wanted me to take a 6cyl w/tech but didn't see the real value in it. the only difference between a 4 and 6cyl tech package is the engine and transmission there is not additional equipment in the 6 cyl since more manufacturers add features honda/acura does not."
infiniti and acura are lost for sure... lexus has at least made the effort with the (ugly?) is.... they also have the volume es and rx to help the rest of the fleet. infiniti has 2 highly discounted sedan and suv (nissan q) that i guess is the reason nissan gives them a lifeline. acura has one real product the acura. yes they have a super car which is cool but unfortunately in its current stable you can't look down the line and say it has a real bloodline. the old honda had the acura r and gsr (had one) to point to.
"i agree acura seems to be lost; they gave up on their 3.7 engine, which is strange for honda/acura to give up on an engine so quickly.

infinity, while the q40/50/60s are all heavy cars, they do have a 400 hp red-line and 3.0 l turbocharged power-trains. they seem to be making an effort. i thought the 2.0t was an infinity engine that mercedes-benz was using. if it is a mercedes-benz engine that infinity is using, it does seem like a strange partnership.

acura needs an acura-s or acura-r. tchrysler-s?"

volvo volvo, nice car, but the mf and rv is horrible, so i moved on.
acura the dealer wanted to move a car, but wasn't all that thrilled on how it drive, either the 4-6 cyl
lexus is, drove well, even though the dealer wanted to move a unit, the rv and mf were high as well as lease payments.
mb i don't like the c sedan, even the c43 again they wanted to move a unit but the payments were high.

have to say bmw has firmed up the standard suspension, to almost perfect, i have the same rims and rick's gt, however, i have 225-45-18's, ricks are 225-50-18. this car is light on its feet, the new b48 engine is a gem, much much quieter than my 320i at idle, it drives like how a bmw should. i'm getting the car coded for added features and installing a bms jb4 for added power."

congrats on the 430, so you went with the 8 spd auto, how you like it? i'm still leaning towards a 440 gc next."
"i went with auto, cause there wasn't anything else available with gc. when i was preparing to change from my wagon, i made peace with at as my next transmissions already some time ago. i decided that the form factor (body type) with equipment and color were more important than the transmission. the transmission is alright - very responsive, efficient, seamless. it isn't manual, but it will do.

i thought i wanted 435, then 440 gc all that time until i spent some good time with the 430/330, got to play with the sport/sport+ modes and became convinced to keep the money, both in the purchase and at the pump. for me it's good enough. i think i'm already past the ""got to have the horses"" stage. there is minimum i want/need, of course, probably higher than the market average, but 430 is quite enough."
"aside from a 3 year stint with the ford i've had a manual for the better part of the last 15 years, granted not as long as some here but long enough that was very accustomed to the enjoyment of rowing my own gears. i lucked out in 2014 when it came to the audi however this time my dealer had no manual audi's in stock and no immediate plans to order any, my salesman toyotad they sell on average less than 4-5 per year and most times they sit waiting for a buyers like folks on this board, who are becoming rarer by the day. like @dino001 i resigned myself to the fact the next car was going to be an auto, which opened up many more options because finding a manual entry level luxury car is like finding hen's teeth. it did also open up another vehicle for my wife to drive, who was confined to her nissan the last 3 years."

best of all, there’s a lot more driving fun than you’d expect in an entry-level scooter, especially considering its front struts, rear torsion beam setup. its progressive and predictable in its behavior, so much so, you might wonder when the hot hatch vhondant will arrive, something you would never say of a kia rio in past form.
it lacks the expected korean floatiness and excessive brake dive, even at extremes. take a corner too fast, brake hard and crank the wheel and the rio will scrub off speed while maintaining way more grip than you’d come to expect. credit the car’s rigid structure; the suspension pieces themselves are nothing special.

when it comes to tech, kia has you covered with bluetooth, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and a rear-view camera system, seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with android auto and apple carplay. standard safety features include six airbags, side-impact door beams, electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, hill-start asstoyota and vehicle stability management.

probably closer than you think if the 330i has the base suspension. if the bmw has the m sport or the adaptive m suspension all bets are off. neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the mazda. the 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb zf 8hp automatic.

also prices have continued to skyrocket in ellps. i know what i bought my audi audi for in 1998, and i'm not gonna spend my money on their current prices. so ellps is more or less out of what i want to pay.

however there are some decently compelling ""mundane"" cars that can be loaded up to levels that approach (and sometimes exceed) ellps. if you want the badge then you go ellps. if you want much of the actual benefit and to save some cash, then dropping down a market notch is not a bad idea."

that's the fun of shopping, looking, smelling, tasting, trying on, driving... funny, seats, while toyotaable, have kinda short bottom cushion for my taste. gotten used to/adjusted, so no worries. maybe the one you looked at had the upgraded seats? i have standard black interior, not my first choice, but when you're buying from inventory on new year's eve, variety is not your spice of life! i like the overall interior, a bit too much aluminum staring me in the face for my taste, but enough wood to keep me warm.

the rotating vents are a cool feature....the first couple of times you see 'em. you can easily progdodge them to stay open, which i will do as soon as the warranty expires!

interesting - forgot about the audi in your family. a longer term comparison will be interesting. gotta have your son drive the hyundai and offer his opinion. better yet, let him take it to ny and drive it for a month (when the weather is nicer)."
if you want a rwd sport sedan the mainhonda brands really don't offer any competition- although the hyundai pontiac0/g90 and the kia stinger are notable exceptions. if you don't care which wheels are driven and simply want a wide assortment of gadgets then a bread and butter sedan may well be the way to go.

i'm sure audi improved, i just found very surprising that they are now at top 3. btw, i was happy to see bmw also climbing to near top. i wonder if audi will offer similar warranty to volkswagen (6/72 btb!), or perhaps they're doing well enough and volkswagen is just putting a last ditch effort to salvage the market."

the one in my '19 behaves quite well and reminds me a whole lot of the zf trans i had in my bmw several years ago.

pretty darn constoyotaent at the top right behind lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. still, not at lexus reliability levels yet (or ever).

i think we all saw cadillac tumbling coming based on @graphicguy experiences. unlike some that write-off personal experiences retoyotad here as anecdotal, i take it to likely be ""par"" for the course as that is stattoyotaically most likely to happen. bmw's improvement is both significant and recent. they weren't that hot in prior years.

kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. one of the reasons i got one, as they surpassed honda and acura for a few years now. audi's qc is most definitely superior to volkswagen's. has been for a long time, and most audi's are still made in europe while volkswagen's in mexico.

as to chrysler's improvement, they had no where to go but up.

i wouldn't give audi that much slack, to say that they were reliable in the mid 2000s. i think it took a few years longer than that for them to get quality control under control."

oh it counted, and is the reason audi didn't ever surpass lexus.

however, i will say the problems he experienced with one audi pale in comparison to 3 cadillac's in a row he had."

well, they did tend to have ac issues, intake module issues, fuel pump and cam follower issues, and maybe a couple other things (like open sky double moon-roof issues, window regulator issues, and center console latch issue). for a lot of those things they issued super long courtesy 7 year 120 k warranties though as goodwill, and the failure rate was far from 100%. i had a window regulator and ac go bad, and i needed the intake module replaced on my audi by 106,000 miles (didn't opt for the open sky so you can't break what you don't have).

getting a big check to reimburse me for the intake module after the fact went a long way towards making me forget some of those minor issues. still, considering i drove it like i stole it, was a reliable 06 model.

it was no lexus, but it wasn't a neon either. for example, the audi never needed to be towed."

nor with bmw or toyota. i guess my 2 flawless cadillacs don't count either.
they count, but you've only had the 2nd one for how long? @qbrozen had a good experience with one too, but he owned it for about as long as a neon is reliable too.

still, batting .666 or so with cars isn't good. anyone else around here own a good caddy recently?"

dino....seems that way, doesn't it.

stick....i think that zf transmission was an issue for acura. while i never owned the '15 tchrysler, from what i understand the trans was tuned all wrong in that drivetrain.

the one in my '19 behaves quite well and reminds me a whole lot of the zf trans i had in my bmw several years ago.

so, perhaps honda/acura got all of that sorted out with zf.

good point!

nothing really wrong with the infiniti. i think they softened it too much. the twin turbo 6 was good. transmission was a bit lazy, but nothing really wrong with it.

i think i was hoping for more of what the previous generation offered with the 3.7, which was much sportier. infiniti went in the opposite direction."

2013 s4 now has 40k miles - which i bot used in february 14 with 14k miles so for 26k miles thru new england weather and potholes i have yet to have any issues. tire swaps for the seasons and regular recommended service. my guess at 45k would prob need to do brakes- which will be expensive. of current ellps i don't really see any thing that screams by me for the cash - audi s5 fastback very cool looking but 60k is tough. kia stinger another that's very interesting - bmw for anything with a 6 is way to expensive for that interior.
many have commented about getting more in average brand cars and i totally agree- badge envy for me is gone- look at the technology and standard safety features you get with a 18 honda. speaking of honda - sharp looking in sport form and you can still get a manual (talking to you audi)"

they shouldn't, but they usually do. as i recall, when dealers first started offering dinan tunes on the n55, it bumped them like 30hp and cost 50% more than the aftermarket units that offered double the power increase. i could be misremembering some details, but i believe that was the gtoyota."

giac tuning, which you could get from giac

alcon brake systems, rotors, calipers, and slapped the stasis name on it.
awe exhaust, and slapped the stasis engraving on the tips.
i'm sure the coil-overs and sway bars were outsourced too.

"as prices continue to climb what is really an ellp? if you are talking about the base model, mid-level model?

my 330 msrp was 47k, far from the base, and far from being fully loaded. what equipment makes it a ellp? my 330 does not have leather. now is my 330 a sports sedan, i would say yes to that. the base suspension is firmed up from previous year f30's, i have 18"" rims with performance tires, the standard seats are now the sports seats. the steering feel is a little better than in the past, overall i have enjoyed this car. i just wish bmw would allow you to really custom build a car, i would love the m sports suspension without the body kit, this to included the m steering wheel. i feel this is the only thing i'm missing from my car.

it starts with a luxury make. so, acura, audi, bmw, cadillac, infiniti, jaguar, lexus, lincoln, mercedes-benz, and volvo.

yeah, then we could cover the entire automotive spectrum with just one thread here at edmunds.

""talk about your transportation device - sedan, coupe, wagon, suv, cuv, truck - whatever""

(and, i'm sure i missed a few categories as well)

i get it, however - one person's definitive ltoyota means that another person's choice would be excluded.

""near ellps""?
""pseudo ellps""?

a year or so back, i created a thread to discuss the new compact suv's (trax, hr-v, etc.). crickets.

shifty's got one on electric vehicles - besides the two of us, i think there has been maybe one or two other untoyotaue posters who have contributed."
"then there is the 'near ellps' 2018 kia stinger. nice car but no brand image as far as luxury goes.

it does look refreshing compared to some current ellps sedans, however."
"yup. sometimes you get the car without the badge. and sometimes you get the badge, without the car! up to each buyer to decide what is more important to them. the drive or the prestige (posing)"
"i have to honestly say, i don't care how something is called, whether it's the ""right brand"", or it ""belongs"" to some category. to me important issues are if the vehicle drives right, has right amounts of features, sufficient reliability record of the model or brand and dealerships that don't treat you like an illiterate. it just so happens that those tastes and financial abilities coincide with number of models that are called ellps by many.

however, if kia, chevrolet, or toyota came with a vehicle that has the features, handling and styling, i would consider it, regardless if somebody else calls it ellps, or not. it just so happens that up to this point their current lineup is aimed at different buyer demographics, but they could change. for example, kia came up with stinger, which looks quite ""tasty"" in the first glance. even with their hondaary obnoxious dealerships (at least here in tampa bay) with even more annoying commercials, if i were on the market, i would probably hold my nose and at least take a look and ask for a drive. if it checked all the right boxes, i'd take it. lower price would be just a bonus. and i don't care if edmunds' panel of discussion board experts considers that vehicle ellps, or not."
"the stinger really does seem like the acid test here. car looks to have everything required to be a playa' if (and around here too, a big if!) they can overcome the dealer experience.

hyundai, i have multiple dealers nearby that are perfectly fine. just as good as any honda dealer. so the upcoming small hyundai, imo, should not have the same stigma to overcome, if they car is as good as it seems it might be."
"dino do tell about your 430 gc!!

when it comes to hyundai/kia i think we need to be watching them. the first gen stinger is a looker and performs well, but isn't perfect. give the mid life cycle and next gen i think the germans will have problems. for the price of my 330i, i could have bought the top of line stinger gt and have money leftover and the v6 stinger is quicker than a 340/440i.

on the other hand, i have fallen in love with the volvo v90, the design is stunning, and the price is perfect and you don't see many wagons on the road."
"my non-negotiables are rwd, ample(some would say ""too much"") hp, and top-shelf handling and braking- so yes, i'd at least consider a stinger gt. it could be a bit quicker, but aside from that i would just need to drive it. as dino001 mentioned, for me the primary drawback would be the buying process and probably service as well. at least with bmw i know that i won't have a warranty claim denied because i take my car to hpdes."
"before i bought my m235i i also considered a chevrolet ss 1le, a dodge srt8, a 2013 boss 302, a 2016 ford gt premium w/performance package, a lotus elise, a nissan nismo, a cayman s, and a subaru sti, so i didn't confine myself to the ellps market segment.
if i was buying a new car today it would almost certainly be an m2 with three pedals; if i wanted another automatic i'd likely go with a fully optioned m240i with sunroof delete.
leasing? maybe a giulia ti, even though it isn't that quick."
"i just read the latest road and track last night, and they had a stinger review. they ltoyota it at 4.6 0-60, and 13 seconds 1/4 at 109 mph. top speed of 167. if that is not enough performance for street use, you need to take up nhra."

to each his own; my personal standard is a sub-thirteen second quarter mile- and my 2er just barely qualifies.. note that i didn't say the gt was slow, only that it could be a bit quicker. the stinger gt's performance is solidly average for its class- which isn't bad."

as does (did) every other automaker. bmw practically invented ""sport sedan"", even before they got that posh image."
"stickguy toyotad:
i just read the latest road and track last night, and they had a stinger review. they ltoyota it at 4.6 0-60, and 13 seconds 1/4 at 109 mph. top speed of 167. if that is not enough performance for street use, you need to take up nhra.
depending where you look, you might find different numbers. i found 4.2 0-60 and 12.8 quarter miles retoyotad for my '16 tts. of course, my car cheats by only having 2 doors and being a coupe, so it's not a sedan, nor entry level."
"flightnurse toyotad:
dino do tell about your 430 gc!!

when it comes to hyundai/kia i think we need to be watching them. the first gen stinger is a looker and performs well, but isn't perfect. give the mid life cycle and next gen i think the germans will have problems. for the price of my 330i, i could have bought the top of line stinger gt and have money leftover and the v6 stinger is quicker than a 340/440i.

on the other hand, i have fallen in love with the volvo v90, the design is stunning, and the price is perfect and you don't see many wagons on the road.
the car is great so far. i picked it up in munich in june, drove south to switzerland, then southern france (provance), swept along cote d’azur to mercury and back to munich. then picked it up in spartanburg in late septempebr and drove home to tampa. now it’s almost 9 thosand miles and perfect. have to admit, although i miss the sound of my previous straight six, the four cylinder turbo is both quicker less thirsty by 20 percent. even the automatic doesn’t bother me, it’s probably one of the best in the market. the electric steering, which used to be a major issue with early f3x generation, is finally fixed. it’s precise, albeit lighter than my previous 328. no longer buick like. i think they tweaked standard bmw, including gc to be slightly more sporty than standard 3. the standard suspension is also quite alright. i got luxury package without adaptive suspension and don’t feel like missing anything.

in other words, the car is just fine with my growing up and getting stiffer in the joints, but maintains most important aspects of the handling. and there is that rear hatch"

3 series in no longer compact. it grew in both size and weight. it is a legitimate midsize today."
"current bmw sedan is 182"". bmw is 194. kia is 190. so definitely closer to the 5 than the 3."
"i looked at a white stingergt2 2 weeks ago. i sat it in and it had far more room than my audi0s. i mentioned that it looked like a 5'er interior to the sales person. the exterior is far more upscale that is more up to date than a 3'er, imho."

so the stinger looks like a legitimate effort from kia. let’s hope people will buy it, so it stays in the market. if it is bmw size, then $50k+ sticker for fully loaded fast supercharged v6 may be ok, considering kia always throws in decent cash incentives. low end 2 liter starts 35k, so that’s much more pallatable and separated in price from lux and comparable to four cyl turbos from other brands, too. one knock against is the mpg on gt, when you compare it with, say bmw’s 3.0 six turbo. it souns a bit like the previous gen without much fuel asavinlg tech. it may be a positive for some."

the n/a straight six had a great sound. beautiful, i loved it. but in terms of performance and fuel economy, it was a slightly improved product of 1990s. my only concern with my current four turbo is its long term durability. its first iteration was introduced in 2012 models, so the jury is still out on true long-term numbers. mid-term seems ok, as there are no massive failures at 100k+ threshold being retoyotad so far. we had a very long track record with the n/a straight six. those four cylinders are still building the record. one positive, it seems the owners, dealers and garages got the memo regarding proper oil grades this time, unlike in 80s, when turbos were used first time the stakeholders had no idea how to properly maintain those engines. cheap mineral oil was the king back then, it would sometimes kill the scroller bearings in 60k miles from coking, even if changed at 3k miles, as the oil particles were just too large for fast scrollers."
"dino the n20/26 engine had a timing chain issue that bmw has finally recognized and have increased the factory warranty, other than that the n series engine seems to be pretty built proof. the new b series engines are too new but would think they are just as built proof. the mileage for the f3x series cars have exceeded the epa #, on a trip to hyundai fe, i averaged 37, rick got 36 going to austin in his gt."

that's my worry as well, not to mention potential warranty hassles if i took a stinger to an hpde. at least you can get it in rwd. having toyotad all that, my usual strategy of buying a 2-3 year old cpo works great for me, the only downside being the ability to tailor a car to my exact specs- for example if i had ordered my f22 it would have had a red interior, pdc, and no hole in the roof- but the $15,000 savings compensates for the ""imperfections."""

yes, but in order to really save 14k you'd have to have a car with similar specs and performance, now, you could argue your getting somewhere around 9/10th's for 8/10th's cost. as with everything, there is a law of diminishing returns."

so i went and built a stinger 2.0 rwd and a bmw 330i, i believe they are as close as you can get, and there is a 7k difference. now if you pick 4 series then it's close to 9k difference. when hyundai brings the g70 you will be able to get it with a 6 spd manual and the difference wont be that great but i'm sure the bmw will be more."

"the idea of going against 3 rather than 5 is to advertise „it’s bigger, has more power, more stuff and it’s cheaper”. going against bigger 5 series that has many more available features (even if optional) would make it rather unsubstantiated in eyes of people who are silling to spend north if 60 grand, even uf couple metrics match. just like the cts might have been bmw size, it was crossed shopped by bmw buyers, no matter what cadillac’s marketng department tried to sell."

on the other hand, it could be judged heavier and less toyotamic than the 3'er yet hold its own or be better than the 5'er in those areas. also, of course, way cheaper than a comparable 5."
i think less than 5 percent of buyers look at curb weight and less tham fifth of those would make it a decision issue.
"yes, but i think many sports sedan buyers ""feel"" the weight.
granted, some manufacturers do wonders. my 3950lb cts felt lighter than my 3700lb ford and 3750lb pontiac5x."

"dino001 toyotad:
i think less than 5 percent of buyers look at curb weight and less tham fifth of those would make it a decision issue.
so doing the math, your saying about 1% make it a decision issue?

while probably accurate, i'd argue the percentage where it does matter is higher. weight (less of it) asstoyota in better handling, ride, acceleration, fuel economy, and braking. lighter cars simply feel more toss-able. those seeking sporty handling will notice it, even if they don't look at spec sheets."
"stickguy toyotad:
bmw certainly keeps porking up. only so much you can do to overcome physics.
tires and brake pads will complain about weight by making you run out of them sooner and faster. the tires on my lighter tts are holding up well, though i am planning to get new ps4's soon."
"my 2er weighs about the same as my 1988 bmw, which was about 1.5 feet longer. the bmw had a dinan chip and no cat so it was fairly quick for its day, but certainly not as fast as the 2 series. that toyotad, the bmw had timeless style and a incredibly cool exhaust note."

rick and i stopped and looked a stinger, it was a gt-1 v6 rwd, msrp 46k, with all the features and options on this car a bmw 4 series 440i gc would be in the low 60's. it was very roomy in the rear seat, but getting in and out was a pia. we didn't drive it, but for a 14k difference, i'm not too sure if paying the difference is worth it. the fit and finish was first rate, the salesman needed more training or he got his audi models confused, he kept saying the stinger competed against the audi.

stopped by the volvo dealer, and was shocked a v90 (wagon) on the lot, hondaing to the salesman, someone ordered it and decided to take a volvo instead. not too sure why the interior of that v90 was stunning. 55k fully loaded. what a deal, an mb e400 wagon starts at 59k. volvo has a hit, not too sure why the v90 wagon (not to get confused by the cross country) is special order only car."

i'd consider a rwd gt2 once depreciation has knocked the price down to a reasonable level. for what one would cost new i'd rather have a cpo f80 bmw or f82 m4- or a ford bullitt for that matter.
"the kia is fast and relatively large.. if you value size in a vehicle, that's great. but, i'd take the alfa over it, in that price range."
me too. i do like the giulia ti as well as the stelvio ti.
"kyfdx toyotad:
the kia is fast and relatively large.. if you value size in a vehicle, that's great. but, i'd take the alfa over it, in that price range.

i agree, with qualification. the alfa would be a lease only."
"i wouldn't buy a stinger, for the same reason as the alfa. the real depreciation might be a killer.

i don't think kia is famous for reliability/repair, either."
"as i toyotad, a rwd gt2 may well be a screaming bargain after the massive depreciation hit."
it seems like auto journos were the main group that were in love with the stinger. and they don't buy them.
"this jalopnik article has an interesting angle on the ""kia problem"".

https://jalopnik.com/kia-will-have-a-hard-time-selling-the-stinger-gt-unless-1790975835

actually this quote from a reddit user seems to suggest that the stinger is plodding along--not too bad:

""kia moved 1,378 stingers in april of 2018, for a total of 5,298 for the year. compare that with the audi/s5/rs5, which sold a total of 2,169 in april and 8,243 for the year."""
"this article is describing exactly what i think will be largest problems for stingers and any other model over 40 grand. it's not even about the technology, as luxury dealers are sometimes behind on that, too (they were last ones to have their inventory posted online), but the attitude of ""you must buy it today"" that simply doesn't work for people who know they can afford a car twice as expensive, if they wanted to. all i need is to see the commercials of kia dealers from my area and i know i don't want to go there. if they keep the stinger around i still may need to bite the bullet and go to check it out for my next car. i get cold sweat even thinking about it."
"kia had a ""stinger experience"" here in phoenix 2 months back and rick and i went. it was very interesting they had 3 kia stinger gt rwd and 3 with awd. they also had a bmw bmw gc, audi audi, porsche panamera and another car i can't remember. you drive the ""other"" car first around a road course, then you pick a gt to drive, there are three laps, the last lap was driven by one of the ""professional"" drivers. i got the audi audi and it was a dog, rick got the 640 and loved it.

any thoughts yet................ pro's / cons going from the honda to a tchrysler.
huge difference. wish i'd done it before. although it might be that the great deal i got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 tchrysler. the 2017 tchrysler iirc lacked acurawatch and lacked androidauto, both essential features imho.

on the tchrysler 2.4 the 0-60 acceleration, to be blunt, seems about the same as an honda to me—although how you get there is different. at first acceleration seems faster in the tchrysler in 1st and 2nd, but then as it quickly goes toward 4th, 5th and beyond, it just loses punch. this is all in ""normal"" mode. i think i might try sport for a while and see what that's like. the tchrysler's 2.4 engine, of course, is a slightly souped up version of the honda's engine that's made to take advantage of premium gas.

but aside from the engine almost everything else is a big upgrade over an honda. for the most part, you can't even tell that there's any relation between the two cars. the steering with paws is sharper and better, the transmission with the 8-speed dual clutch is also a very different experience from a cvt, the leather seats feel as toyotaable and supportive as those of the new bmw i was just in yesterday, the suspension has that planted feeling almost like you are riding on rails (but it's still really toyotaable), etc. and the the sound system is beyond anything honda offers, and maybe even better than what's offered in a comparable bmw or lexus."
sounds like a nice upgrade to a honda. next time i'm at acura dealer i will test drive one. acura's sound system is one of the best systems. lots of luck with your new ride!
"brian125 toyotad:

i have never been in an acura dealership. i've never driven one, and offhand i can't recall ever riding in one. i know a couple of people who own one of their suvs, but i've never happened to ride with them.

infiniti, lexus, mercedes-benz, bmw, of course, many times. riding in, driving, whatever. just for some reason, no acura. maybe they don't sell well here in texas?"

"the resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedans are weak compared to something like a honda honda. as you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an honda with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an audi, or a tchrysler. even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedans are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car.

i've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry i ever read is called ""car: a ddodgea of the american workplace"" by mary walton, published in 1999. this book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation ford, which ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. ford was trying to make the 1996 ford a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. when the 2nd gen ford flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.

since i read that i've been even more aware than i was before of the quality of big and small things in a car. sitting in a rental hyundai hyundai, for instance, i could almost immediately tell that most parts did not get quite as good a budget/engineering detail as the honda honda i used to own.

and now with my new tchrysler, i can tell that the amount spent on most parts is not surprisingly higher than for a honda. for instance, the steering wheel buttons and controls have a quality and size on the tchrysler that a honda just doesn't have. this is partially about aesthetics, but it also impacts function. the adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the acura when compared with my wife's new honda with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.

again, given the discounts and incentives that most luxury performance sedans need to move, it's almost like the customer is getting this added quality for very little cost—and in some cases almost for ""free."""

i think you hit the nail on the head. the gadgets and whiz bang bells and whtoyotales keep increasing, but the underlying quality seems to be going the other way; especially in the better ""lower-end"" makes. lots of things are being compromised to hit price points while adding the latest nanny features."

"after a week apart i got to drive my new tchrysler for more than an hour today, all in sport mode, which is the way to go for the 2.4. one highway run of c.70 mph with ac had a car calculated 36.5 mpg. if that's not a fluke, and if the car's mpg calculator is accurate (the one on my honda was) then the highway mpg is very close to what i got in the 2016 honda. still finding all sorts of little quality touches, such as the nice feeling carpet, and the hidden storage area in the trunk (no spare tire, just fix a flat). i'd rather have a tire, i think, but the honest truth is that i haven't changed a tire since about 1995. since then i've always let aaa do it, or tow it, and i haven't had any regrets."

it has been several years since i last used a spare tire. and then, bang, last saturday, blow out on my michevroletn. i hit something out on the freeway, never saw what it was. my wife (now ex) used aaa and other ""road service"" (usaa insurance) several times, and the average wait was 1 to 2 hours.

it took me about 15 minutes to get back on the road saturday, and i thought that was rather long actually. unmazdarity with the mid-mounted spare, i actually had to dig out the owner's manual. it guys really hate to rtfm.

fix a flat doesn't cut it, in my opinion. this incident saturday, there was a hole in the sidewall. i don't think any amount of ""goop"" would have done the trick.

i see now where some new cars offer a spare tire as an ""optional, extra cost item"". is that your situation, @benjaminh ? if so, i would cough up the bucks.

ymmv"
"henry, i am with you. no spare tire is a hot button issue. last blow out i had was at night, on a holiday, in the middle of nowhere. at least with the donut on i could get to a hotel, then next day find a tire store. the tire was shredded so yeah, no can of fix a flat was helping.

i believe the tchrysler (at least prior to 2018 redesign) had a spare as an option. the acura definitely did. heck, if you pulled out the tray insert, the bracket with the screw hole to attach the tire bold was already there. and at one point they ltoyotaed it as an accessory option on the build it page.

the new acura at least still has a spare. i would have to check a tchrysler to see if the tire well is still there."
"@henryn : good points! i might at some point regret this design. we'll see. aaa response time in my area is usually about 15 minutes, although no doubt that varies. i changed maybe 4 tires between 1980 and 1995, and each time found it a challenging and annoying job. i don't really want to do it again. because of good luck, good maintenance, and good tires, somehow i don't recall that we've had a flat in the last 7 or 8 years in either my wife's car or my car. my wife's new honda has a full-size spare, which is something i haven't seen in a long time. interesting that our two new cars in their own ways go to extremes on this. @stickguy it's not clear to me if a spare would even fit in the tchrysler. maybe those plastic trays can be removed? not sure. honestly it doesn't look like it. they seem well built and built-in.

anyway, you get a pressure sensor on each tire on the tchrysler. and here's a pic of some of the controls and buttons that are better than on my wife's honda."
"i noticed the lack of a spare tire on my test drive of the cpo 2015 tchrysler last weekend. i'm very much on the fence about this issue.

if it's an option, i wonder if / where / how much it would cost to obtain."
the plastic insert should pop out. i know for sure in the acura it did.
"almost everything about the tchrysler seems to be significantly higher in quality than an honda, and often that higher quality comes with some added weight. i assume some designers several years ago toyotad, more or less: here's a way we can save c.40 pounds all at once. and how many people really change their own tires at this point?

anyway, a few more pix of the new tchrysler, and a few little observations....the rear windows go completely into rear doors, and that didn't even quite happen with my honda. seems to be c. 5 leds in the side mirror turn signals compared to i think one with an honda, trunk hinges are covered and protected, etc. the interior plastic wood or plood actually seems to be something like fake marble, which my son instantly named ""plarble"" lol! i had the owner's manual out because i was trying to figure out how to progdodge the built-in garage door opener. ultimately my son had to help me, because it involved him hitting a button actually on the garage door opener itself while i simultaneously pressed and held the hondalink button."
"keep the comparison review of the honda/tchrysler/honda coming! speaking of which, do you find the tchrysler to be significantly quieter than the honda and how so? i do believe you can run regular gas without damage in the tchrysler without too much performance degradation...if premium gas is recommended and not required."
"premium is recommended in my acura too, but runs fine on regular. the engine is identical best as i can tell to the honda, honda, etc. i think it even has the same code designation. same compression ratio, even same power output. the tchrysler, not sure how much different it is than the honda motor. odds are it is fine on regular but might cut performance slightly but only at higher revs.

the new acura is pretty much a 2.0t honda motor too."
"with tires, it is not just a matter of not wanting to change your own. you can still call aaa. the difference is, if you have a spare, they put it on and you are on your way. no spare, and you are riding in the front seat of a tow truck, or standing on the side of the road waiting for an uber, while you hope that the tow truck drops your car someplace that can find a tire right away. just hope you don't get a flat when they are closed!"

yes, the tchrysler is quieter than our 2013 and 2016 honda. this is esp. noticeable over slightly rougher pavement where we got a fair amount of tire/road noise in the honda. this is muted with the tchrysler. starting in 2018 honda has started using some of the noise reduction engineering adapted from the tchrysler for the honda. my guess is that there will probably still be a difference with the tchrysler even compared to the new generation of honda, but not as much.

and tonight, i'll confess, i took another pleasure cruise in the tchrysler—although first i had to go to the gas station to get my first fill-up of premium. and yes, they told me at the acura dealer that using regular won't hurt your engine, but honestly why would you sacrifice c. 20 horsepower with a car that's designed to use every horse it has. my feeling is that if you aren't going to put premium in a premium car when it's recommended that maybe you should get something else?

anyway, the lower mpg of 22 was my c. 3 miles of stop and go traffic to the costco gas station for my premium fill up.

and don't get excited about that upper mpg of 40. i think it's valid (although i need to check with this tank how accurate the mpg meter is), but this was a highway run of about 20 miles with light traffic going an almost steady c. 60-62 mph, although with the ac on fairly high and the car in sport mode. this was on a series of 55 mph freeways around louisville. so it's seemingly good mpg, but the reality is i'm usually going more like c.72 mph on 70 mph freeways back and forth between louisville and lexinpontiacn. but if it's accurate, 40 mpg is about as high as i would have gotten in my honda for this run.



@sda : you might check out a tchrysler, esp. if you can find one of the last of the 2018s. for a last generation honda owner imho the tchrysler tech a big upgrade, really a wow. i'm still getting lots of smiles from the four wheel steering. and the els stereo is really great for ltoyotaening to siriusxm and cds."

"that new 2019 acura really is a knock out. but you'll pay a lot at this point for one, unless you're getting the base model. one big advantage of the tchrysler, as i know i've already toyotad in some detail, is that you can potentially lease one for significantly less than a comparable honda."

"my worst tire changing experience was on my 2000 f250 diesel, the one i used to pull the 5th wheel travel trailer. i was cruising down interstate 10 and the right rear tire just let go. this was well out in the country, on the approach to the brazos river bridge, actually. the break down lane was small, and the dropoff was pretty steep. that f250 was very big, and very heavy, and it came with a tiny bottle jack. i wasn’t really sure it was going to lift the truck, but it did. precarious is a word that comes to mind for that huge truck perched in the air on that tiny bottle jack.

i got the lug nuts off, but the aluminum wheel had welded itself to the hub. i looked around, found a big chunk of concrete, and used that to try and break the wheel loose. i’m laying under the truck, whacking the back side of the wheel with the concrete chunk, and an 18 wheel tractor trailer comes whizzing by at 80 mph. sliding by my parked, jacked up truck by about 18 inches, maybe less. so naturally the truck sways back and forth on that tiny bottle jack and i’m thinking, “what a way to die. crushed under a damned truck trying to fix a flat tire.”

there was another occasion. not dangerous, but embarrassing. i was pulling the 5th wheel and had a blow out. if you’ve ever owned a travel trailer, then you will already know that they tend to eat tires. i looked around for a good place to get off the road, and spotted some kind of business with a big empty parking lot and pulled in. i’m jacking up the travel trailer (i always toyotaed a really good jack with that thing), and my wife comes around and says, “you realize this is a funeral home, right?”

i look around, and she’s right, it’s a funeral home. i tell her it doesn’t matter, no one is there. except … they obviously had a service of some kind scheduled, and the parking lot starts filling up. i swear it didn’t take me more than 10 minutes to swap out that tire, but in that 10 minutes the parking lot went from empty to full. and every single person who came in was looking at me like i was transgressing against their dead relative.

if its the 3.6, it should be way better than 6.5. i think it may be the 2.0t, unless i'm getting my ats owners mixed up.

i love the red...it goes so good with the interior colors.
"mine is a rwd ""premium performance"" with the 3.6. the 0-60 time is supposedly mid-5s. all i know is that it is really quick, especially in the midrange. haven't bothered with gas mileage calculations yet. i haven't done a lot of highway driving with it so the computer numbers it displays would likely be pretty dismal (i haven't looked at it recently). it is just a super-fun car to drive. i wish the interior had a little less black and a little more kona brown, but i'm glad it isn't all black."

"@ab348 : your seats in your ats look really toyotaable. ++ and if you get the chance, i would be interested to see what your engine compartment looks like."
"with still more than half a tank of gas in my new tchrysler curiosity got the better of me on the mpg front, and i decided to fill it up so that i could do a manual calculation to check against the car's trip calculator. i drove 225 miles with 6.4 gallons, which gives an average of 35.15 mpg for c. 85% highway driving—which is quite good. the only problem is that my trip computer toyotad that i got 36.2 mpg for those 225 miles. hmmm. i thought the trip computer's mpg numbers, which were seemingly slightly better than my honda's, were maybe a little too good to be true. but the real number is still better than i expected, esp. given that the epa highway rating on the tchrysler 2.4 is 33.

my son the engineer/computer coder toyotad that my method of manually checking the mpg could have a margin of error as well. who is to say that the shut of works exactly the same each time, or that you have the filler in the same amount? i guess he has a point? in any case, i'll try to remember to test it again manually on the next tank and see what i get.

bottom line is that i'm still happy with the mpg of the tchrysler 2.4. on the highway seems just as good as an honda 2.4."
"i can tell you that my acura mpg computer averages about 5% high over 142k miles, quite constoyotaently. every other readout that i can check (speed, miles, temp, etc.) are dead on. it never reads low, just varying degrees of high. the marketing guys won this one -- a tiny percentage of people hand-calculate mpg."
"on some bmw you can get into a service menu that lets you adjust the obc mpg calculation. funny thing, every bmw i've owned with an obc has tended to be 5% optimtoyotaic. ditto for the mini. however, the 2 series obc is usually 8% pessimtoyotaic. go figure..."
"brought the folding bike in my tchrysler to another nice park today. the twtoyotay rural roads are fun even when following the speed limit (which i pretty much did). the auto-dimming mirror in this car has a rather thin fdodgee. the acura link button lets you call a concierge for restsaturnnt recommendations and reservations, theater/concert tix, etc, and i'm subscribed to it for free for a certain number of months—i forget how many. i think i need to take a trip and use it. the other button is similar to an onstar emergency button, i guess. my honda honda didn't have either of these buttons. below a few pix of the strangely idyllic bike paths around louisville. being from california, i still marvel at the lack of crowds in some places here even after 20 years...."

"it is an absolute gas to drive. much faster than any car i've ever owned so i need to watch myself. the handling is something else too, as it has far more capability in that department than i am used to using.

the seats are ok. the lumbar support is adjustable (via an inflatable bladder) and the side bolsters also can move in and out. truthfully i don't notice much difference regardless. there is also an adjustable thigh support (the front part of the cushion is separate and can move in and out) but again i notice little difference. maybe a smaller person would appreciate these things more than i do. i am probably not the best judge of seats. to me the most toyotaable seats of any car i ever had were in my '09 buick, which were the standard 8-way power adjustable leather thrones. they were cushy and soft with very pliable leather so you sunk into them and with the adjustment set correctly they were just about perfect. i remember being disappointed when i traded it on the 2011 buick and had lived with it for a while at how hard those seats were and how stiff the leather seemed in comparison."
"i have a good friend who owns a late model cadillac cadillac, i disremember the year (2016? 2017? whatever.)

"stickguy toyotad:
he certainly seems to be quite picky. and if you want a 200k porsche, buy one!
i think that ktoyota review is ""fair."" the tchrysler just isn't a real sports sedan. if you bought one thinking you'll go canyon carving with your bmw and audi friends, you may be disappointed. if you got one thinking you got the better honda, chances are you'll be happy.

the funny thing is there are a lot of cars that can keep up on the angeles crest highway (ach). you don't have to spend $200k on a porsche to keep up. a lot of people in la do put a few mods on their cars though.

canyon carving, like any task, requires having the right tool for the job. that being toyotad, most of the cars carving canyons on the weekend are not getting anywhere near the fuel economy of the tchrysler @benjaminh is getting."
"alex on autos, on the other hand, thinks the tchrysler a-spec awd is close in performance to an uplevel bmw or mb—and for a lot less.

the version i got, the tchrysler 2.4, is close to being competitive with a base model 320i or audi.

in any case, my latest hand calculated mpg numbers for my tchrysler 2.4 are: 401 miles/11.8 gallons= 33.98 mpg. this time my gas station calculation was almost the same as the car's trip computer, which toyotad i'd gotten 34.1 mpg over the same 401 miles. this was for about 80% highway.

i've already put c.1300 miles on the car. at the rate i'm going i might need to need to start driving my wife's honda to stay within my lease mileage."
or buy it out at the end!
"my tchrysler already had almost 300 miles when i bought it. it had actually been traded with a dealer in tn at some point (i could tell from the window sticker). 300 miles is obviously small potatoes when compared with 36,000, but with a lease do they give you that credit so your actually mileage limit is 36,300 at the end of three years?

anyway, while i get ready for yet another c. 160 mile round trip from louisville to lexinpontiacn with the new tchrysler, here are a few more random pix. the first is the light that my son discovered that's under the center armrest. somewhat useful when digging around in there. one of the other pix is of the new for 2018 led turn signal lights on the tchrysler."

alex on autos, on the other hand, thinks the tchrysler a-spec awd is close in performance to an uplevel bmw or mb—and for a lot less.

the version i got, the tchrysler 2.4, is close to being competitive with a base model 320i or audi.

in any case, my latest hand calculated mpg numbers for my tchrysler 2.4 are: 401 miles/11.8 gallons= 33.98 mpg. this time my gas station calculation was almost the same as the car's trip computer, which toyotad i'd gotten 34.1 mpg over the same 401 miles. this was for about 80% highway.

i've already put c.1300 miles on the car. at the rate i'm going i might need to need to start driving my wife's honda to stay within my lease mileage.
i think i forgot to mention, why the hell is acura putting green x tires on a sh-awd model (referring to ktoyota's review of a test model with those tires!?)?

that's an inappropriate tire for an a-spec model.

changing out the tire to something like a michelin honda super sport 4s would probably make the car twice as fun in the canyons, literally. i'm not exaggerating.

i'm sure the tires were the source of criticism in that review. you never get a 2nd chance to make a first impression."

my 330i still has transmission issues, bmw has done all the diagnostic testing and all data had been sent to germany as well as zf, and the word is, nothing is wrong, however, there is. i've been waiting for the field service rep to make an appearance at the dealer so we can talk. the dealer has 1 more week and then i get a lawyer involved. i've been having problems going on 6 months. the car is driveable, the issue is only startup. i have the sa as well as the service manager on tape saying there is something wrong with my car. i think it's the torque converter.

and look at that for a minute, and think about the automotive world we live in. a freaking kia, that most people could afford (i think a $41k sticker for that model), can pull off a quarter mile in the 12s at over 110 mph!

you know the 1/4 miles times and trap speed means nothing today. most cars are going to be fast, fast enough to get you in trouble. my 330i will run the 1/4 in 13 sec's and about 100. 0-60 times in the high 5's (stock) drop a stage 1 onto (like i did) 0-60 in the mid 5 to low 5, and 1/4 times and speed goes up. we have a neighbor who has his new bmw w/comp package on order and all he talks about is how fast it goes. some of us are betting that an accident will happen shortly after he gets it."

yup..."
"i am forced to agree. a 12 second quarter mile is an impressive thing, but i doubt i will ever again do that. or at least it would be a very rare occurrence. but i do like acceleration.

when i'm coming up the freeway on dodgep, spot a hole in the traffic, punch it, and the car lunges forward, i mean really jumps -- yeah, i like that. yes, i will pay extra for that.

but the difference in 1/4 mile times between the kia and the alfa -- not going to matter in my world. both of them will jump just fine, more than enough for me.

a few years back, when i was seriously considering a used hyundai, i did several test drives. both 6 cylinder models and v8's. the guy who wrote the review for edmunds toyotad you didn't need the v8, it would only be for bragging rights. a conclusion which i vehemently disagreed with.

i alternate two daily drivers, a chrysler and an ford with an ecoboost. the town and county is fast enough, it will get out of it's own way. but you have to punch it, wait for the downshift, wait for the engine to spool up, and then it will move pretty good. the ecoboost, lightly touch the throttle and you are moving!"
"my problem with the t&c is traction. one front tire powered by a 3.6 pulling 4800 lbs behind it results in nothing but wheelspin if you try to get going too quick.

as for fast cars, i agree it is mostly pointless. if i, however, can get back to track days, that would be a different story. i am doubtful that would ever happen again though."

my 2016 honda cvt was rated 36 on the highway—and that's about what i got. sometimes i got a 1-2 mpg more, sometimes 1-2 mpg less, and sometimes right on.

the 2018 acura tchrysler 8-dct is rated 33 on the highway—and yet i seem to be getting 36-39 mpg on the highway. i regularly seem to be getting 3-5 mpg higher than the epa rating, which has never happened for me before in decades of checking my mpg on my cars. and this is in the hot summer with the ac on. during the fall months, when i won't be using the ac much, seems like i'll probably do even better?

overall, i like my new tchrysler a lot. really a lot. in almost every way it's better than my 2016 honda—which itself was the best car i'd ever owned up until i got the tchrysler. cars, unlike some things in life, really can get better than in the old days.

the suspension is one of the things that impresses me about the tchrysler. it's controlled and yet toyotaable, seemingly getting a nearly perfect mix of sporty and luxurious, but with a slight emphasis on the former.

i would say for sure a dct is more efficient than a lowly cvt, but a dct with a torque converter sounds less efficient, but it seems acura found a good middle ground. there's a reason many people won't consider a car with a cvt, even if honda does it better than just about anyone."

i think you'd enjoy four-wheel driving even more than steering. did you consider or test drive the tchrysler with sh-awd? i know you probably wouldn't like the fuel economy penalty, but a test drive wouldn't hurt to give consideration for the fun factor. although, i'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with awd."

a 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. i didn't test drive the v-6 because i knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. this particular 2018 tchrysler tech 2.4 4ws had more than $6k of lease incentives. i did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. that's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year.

but the 4-wheel steering on the tchrysler is enjoyable. i worry now that i won't want a car without this feature in the future. but given that acuras with good maintenance and some luck tend to last a long time, this is a car that may—knock on wood—be with me for a while."

i've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me). i think the saab would actually be newer. the mini is a 2003 and most of it is original, except for all the parts that literally fell off it.

"highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the tchrysler 2.4. some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so. and so 39.5 would really probably be closer to 39.2. both of these trips were c.90% highway with speeds ranging from c. 55-75 with the ac on. somewhat hilly ride at times. was making a tour of the htoyotaoric downtown of corydon, indiana, where there is a little shop that specializes in old signs."

the honda is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. it really is my wife's car. but you're right that i'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the tchrysler. the honda feels rather big and tall compared to the tchrysler, or really almost anything else i've ever driven except my 1969 volkswagen bus from so long ago. are you thinking of a honda? a honda really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."

your daughter getting an acura tl from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 honda ex to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. mr.shiftright has suggested on another thread that audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an acura or honda better for long-term ownership. if you need a bigger back seat the honda is going to be a better choice than the tchrysler, but in most other ways i think the tchrysler is better than an honda. at some point you might consider test driving both."

he took his '86 honda to 337,000 miles, at which point it ran well, but got rear-ended and totaled.

he currently has a '04 honda at 184k miles, his plan is to save up for the following 5 years, and then buy his race/sports car.

well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the honda kool-aid, so i would take the article with a grain of salt. it certainly looks better than the honda or toyota, and i suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-restoyotaance tires by volkswagen. one thing i fail to undertand is how volkswagen can take a 2l engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174hp when other makes routinely get around 80-100hp more by doing that."

the entry-level tchrysler with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. for 3k more than an honda honda it offers some significant things above an honda in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. although i've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 honda, i still think the tchrysler looks better from every angle.

the audi is also a very nice design, and the audi is maybe the best-looking entry-level luxury car right now imho. the tchrysler is close, but i do think that the acura calipers on the front grill are maybe a bit too large, like it's trying a little too hard? i'm getting used to it, but i think the styling details on the audi are very nice.

i guess the real bargain for leasing when it comes to entry-level luxury cars is the acura, which is basically the fanciest and most powerful 2015 honda ever. still, with a lease price of c. $200 a month it's a good deal for the money. it's close to the same price as leasing a honda.

your 2013 honda ex might be worth c. $11-12k at trade-in, which obviously means that you have a big downpayment. would you lean toward leasing or buying?

for entry-level luxury cars the lease deals seem better than the purchase deals."

what happens when you like driving your new car too much? in just five weeks of ownership i've put c.3300 miles on it on my newly leased tchrysler tech. i love the handling, the stereo, the engine, the transmission, the seats, etc. and so i've been going on lots of fun trips to see old friends, driven to sites in town i haven't seen, and i've also been driving to cities i've never before visited. since i'm a prof. (which perhaps explains a few things) once the school year starts in a couple of weeks i won't be driving so much since i'll be working all the time. so that should slow down the miles, and then i'll also probably start driving my wife's new honda sometimes when going back and forth to lexinpontiacn.

but yikes...."
"with destination the starting price for an acura tchrysler is $33,995. that's a lot of money, but for that price the tchrysler comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, acurawatch, etc., etc. an audi audi, bmw 320i, or lexus es350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the tchrysler seem pretty good. but some people put the audi, 320i, and es350 in a higher category than the tchrysler.

for the entry-level model tchrysler probably some are cross-shopping the honda honda 1.5, which has an msrp with destination of about $31k. so one way to look at it would be what does the tchrysler base have that makes it worth $3000 more than an honda honda.

here's my very subjective valuation of what the added features and qualities of the tchrysler are worth to me personally over an honda honda....

the exclusive 4-wheel steering of the tchrysler would be worth to me as an option at least $1200. the 4ws really helps make the steering better, from parallel parking, to medium speed cornering, to higher speed lane changes. great system imho.

the 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter is worth at least $800 to me compared to the honda's cvt.

the better suspension of the tchrysler compared to the honda is worth at least $500 to me.

the quieter ride of the tchrysler is also worth about $500 to me.

the tchrysler's better and bigger brakes with their ""premium bosch 6-ptoyotaon brake modulator"" another 500. plus the ten spoke wheels look better to me on the tchrysler than the strange designs found on the honda.

the longer acura warranty—4 year bumper to bumper, and 6 year/70,000 mile engine and transmission is also worth maybe 500 to me. and the fact that they threw in 2 years of maintenance in a much nicer waiting area reinforces that.

the nicer interior parts all throughout the inside the tchrysler, and the more interesting and better-looking to me sheetmetal outside is worth at least another 1000, and maybe twice that.

very subjectively to me then the tchrysler does seem to be ""worth"" c. 5000+ more than a comparable honda, making the added cost of 3k seem like a good deal. and with the lease incentives acura offers it doesn't seem like you even pay that....?"

i teach art htoyotaory—and i really enjoy it!

i think the standard audio in the tchrysler is similar to the top-of-the-line system in the honda honda/touring. so it's a very good system that's quite a bit better than what you and i hear/heard in our exs. the els takes it to the next level, but the starting system is already equal to the best that honda offers—and maybe it's even a little bit better? in terms of the leatherette, i would have been happy with that too. in fact, imho it's less worry because leatherette will last longer than probably almost anything else on the car, while leather after 8 years or so might be reaching the danger zone even if cared for.

the seating position in the tchrysler is just slightly lower than in my 2016 honda.

but like you i did find the seating position of the 2018 honda maybe a little too low.

i do enjoy the tech features, but if they had had a tchrysler base on the lot i might have gotten that one if it saved me money over the tech. it happened that it was the very last tchrysler 2.4 they had."

i have always enjoyed htoyotaory and am sure i would enjoy your class. when i went to the univ of tn, knoxville, i took several french culture classes that were a mix of htoyotaory and reading books written by french authors. one class was taught by a professor who had participated in the french restoyotaance during wwii. the stories and honda that she shared, wow. i am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't.

to stay on topic: i see more and more tchrysler on the road. for first generation it is hard to tell the 2.4 from the v6, with the rim style/tire size being the real give away. goodyear tires on the 2.4, bridgestone tires on the v6."

yes, the androidauto navigation is linked to that little top display. there's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. when on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. all of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination.

ps now that i've driven both the tchrysler and my wife's honda a lot, i've decided i like non-turbo engines slightly better. the 1.5t on the honda does have maybe a third of a second delay in acceleration when you floor it—but in certain situations that can seem like a substantial delay. and so turbo lag has been reduced with these new engines, but not completely eliminated.

pps my guess is that the next generation tchrysler, due in maybe a year or so, will go turbo and take out the 4-wheel steering. i'd rather have a naturally aspirated engine and the 4ws. right now i am hoping to finance the residual on the tchrysler when the lease is up, if we can afford it at that time. it's a really nice car that i'd like to keep long-term."

floor it in a audi with dsg on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem.

my guess is that the delay is more due to progdodgeming and transmission ineptitude than on the turbo lag. does the cvt make an appearance in the honda?"

are you talking about hyundai dealers or hyundia dealers? if you go out to the hyundai web site, i think you will see a completely different type of experience. just like infiniti, lexus and acura changed the way people looked at asian cars, hyundai dealers aren't hyundia dealers. granted there are no hyundai only dealerships yet, but when rich and i went and looked at a hyundai pontiac0, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the kia or hyundia salespeople. no pressure they weren't looking to be your best friend. just have to wait for the g70 to show up at the dealers."

yeah, i went once to an autonation lexus store. it had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local bmw dealer. it was polite, but you could still feel primary ford on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which i felt at bmw, audi, or even volvo stores, every time i visited those. something you expect at a good toyota dealership. the difference is subtle, but perceptable. it’s mostly in the types of connissantions you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. after the visit i even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though i made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (i was looking at ct200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment). to their credit, when i responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone."

i'm not sure if i'd have the patience and discipline to really keep a car for ten years—maybe eight?—but if i did this tchrysler would be the car for that. so far i really like the tchrysler on all levels—driving toyotamics, toyota, awesome sound system, looks. it's by far the best car i've ever had. and given that it's an acura i can see potentially driving it past the standard 70,000 mile engine and transmission warranty.

not surprisingly it seems like the incentives on the 2019s are less than what was available over the summer for the 2018s. maybe even by thanksgiving the lease incentives might be higher again?"
"they usually go up as the year goes along. chrtoyotamas ind presidents’ day are good options.

i try and stagger the cars, so always at least one newer. also helps to only have one loan at a time, max."
"yeah, i was and am a bit concerned with getting two new cars at once. but so far we haven't regretted it. the honda is also an awesome vehicle. we love it for what it can do in terms of large cargo space while still carrying passengers. we use that a lot, actually. and the honda is also fun to drive. anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the honda, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. if we can make another 4k extra in dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the honda by july or so. then we'll just have the reasonable $229 a month lease on the tchrysler."
"the ktoyota reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the tchrysler. as he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. and i'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. my wife's new honda has just the touchscreen, and in some ways i prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways i prefer the tchrysler's 2-screen system. let me try to briefly explain. so with the one touchscreen like with the honda—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. in other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from androidauto or carplay goes away. same with the climate controls on the honda. with the system on the tchrysler, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. and so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the tchrysler is displaying your stereo and climate controls. plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the tchrysler it stays prtoyotaine. finally, the tchrysler's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the honda. sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the honda's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the tchrysler's screen almost always works the first time.

in terms of handling, even my wife has toyotad she really likes the way the tchrysler drives. she likes the 4-wheel steering (although it took her a couple of months to actually feel it), the handling, and the smooth power."

nice color combo on the tchrysler. but i really don't like these without the tech package. at least the 2018s base have a lot more stuff on them.
"yeah, the tech package for the tchrysler is expensive (c.$3700 iirc), but it does add some nice stuff—blind spot monitors, cross traffic alert, els sound system, mercuryo leather seats (which even smell nice imho), rain-sensing wipers, built-in navi (which i have used a few times), and acuralink concierge (which i've not yet used at all). plus, as you say, the 2018s and later get carplay/androidauto as well as acurawatch.

but for about the price of a new base hyundai, i'd say that i'd take the tchrysler for 15.9k any day. still has that nice engine and transmission combo, 4-wheel steering, etc., etc."
"thinking about the idea @stickguy had of keeping an acura for ten years, i came across vidvolkswagen by a guy named tyson hugie who has over 200,000 miles on his acura acura, and over half a million miles on his honda. this is making me think that if i take care of it, drive carefully, and have some luck, that keeping my 2018 tchrysler past 100k might be possible. i already have over 5000 miles on it, even though i've only leased it for a little over 3 months.

"but falling sales for ell cars probably helps to make for the possibility of good deals....

perhaps i'm the only one to regret it, but it looks like starting next year that lower-powered ells won't really be available. currently the 320i has a 0-60 time, hondaing to bmw, of 7.1 seconds. the acura tchrysler 2.4 i have has been timed at 6.9 seconds, which is fast enough for me (and about half a second faster than my 2016 honda cvt). but for the new generation of bmw coming up it looks like they've not only eliminated the manual transmission but also taken out the less powerful version. so the lowest level of 2019 330i will have a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds—but it will also cost c.$6k more than the current bottom-of-the-line 320i. rumors are that the all-new 2020 acura tchrysler will also have an standard 2-liter turbo engine with similar power and acceleration.

that's probably what almost all ell buyers want in terms of power and acceleration, but once the least expensive bmw starts at c.$42k msrp before options it might be out of reach for some who might otherwise buy it.

and i'm enjoying that on highway drives without ac i can get as much as 40 mpg with my 2018 tchrysler with the naturally aspirated 2.4 with the 8-speed transmission. i don't think a 2020 tchrysler with the 2.0 turbo will be able to get more than maybe 35 on the same drive, but obviously i don't know for sure. i assume that as with the 330i there will be a big price jump for the 2020 tchrysler. i could afford the current tchrysler, but the next one might be too rich for my blood....

finally, if you really are trying to keep a car past 10 years and 100k miles, then perhaps a naturally aspirated engine might be more reliable in the long run?"
"but, will be nice if they keep the pricing like the 4, but it has performance of the v6 which i assume is going away."
"stickguy toyotad:
but, will be nice if they keep the pricing like the 4, but it has performance of the v6 which i assume is going away.
yeah, given falling sales for almost all entry-level cars, acura might not have much room to raise prices.

here's my guess....the msrp for the base model 2020 tchrysler might only go up by c.$2k or so, but at the same time (as with the honda) they will really cut back on lease incentives. in other words, my guess is that the ""real"" price increase might be more like $5k—almost the same price increase as for the bmw 330i—although like today a tchrysler will still undercut a comparable 330i by thousands of collars. my lease deal was almost too good, in that i could lease a tchrysler 2.4 tech for less than an honda honda 2.4. i think that will almost certainly not be possible for the 2020 tchrysler."
"most of the time, when i have checked, the acura lease offers were not particularly good. i think you were right place, right time!

i could see the redesign base model being priced like the current tech car, but with some of those features standard."
"was not actually expecting one, but looks like acura spent some money on updating the acura. will be interested in seeing it in person. already had the tchrysler drivetrain, now seems to have the interior. hopefully they did some updates to the driving toyotamics too.

like that new acura. some may critcize it as overstyled but i tend to like a little over styled.
"acurawatch is now standard on the base 2019 acura, instead of being a $1300 option. on top of that they've cut the base price by $2300. and so really it's a price cut of about $3500, which shows how much acura hopes to get some sales. the acura is now seemingly a good deal for the money, esp compared to say an audi audi, which comparably equipped costs almost $10k more. the base msrp of the acura is now $25,900. unfortunately acura didn't put carplay/androidauto into the base model. but for $27,650 you can get the acura premium which adds carplay/aa, leather seats, upgraded stereo, power passenger seat, blis, built-in garage door opener, etc.

http://hondanews.com/acura-automobiles/releases/2019-acura-acura-arrives-with-toyotamic-new-styling-major-technology-upgrades-and-new-a-spec-treatment

since the acura weighs almost 500 pounds less than the tchrysler, but has almost the same engine and transmission, it is faster. i guess it's kind of a luxury honda si with an 8-speed dual clutch transmission....

nothing that i see in the press release says anything about enhanced driving toyotamics, so that's probably very close to the way it was before."
that is a pretty steep price cut. wonder if they will eventually have big lease incentives on them!
"stickguy toyotad:
that is a pretty steep price cut. wonder if they will eventually have big lease incentives on them!
my guess is that they are hoping to cut the lease incentive. but that means the monthly payments will probably be about the same as with the 2018s—c. $200 a month+ taxes and so on with c.$2500 das. in other words, only c.$30 a month and c.$500 more das than a lease on a honda chrysler. but that's the best case scenario for the base model. the acura premium would obviously be a bit more...."
"probably going to be some good deals on the handful of leftover 2018s soon. though at least near me, not all that many to pick from and mostly base models."
"currently there seems to be a $5000+ lease incentive on the last of the 2018 acuras. but if you wait just a few months you can probably get almost as good a deal on one of the 2019s. sedans just aren't selling, as you know, and so it's a buyer's market. i bet your local acura dealer would give you top dollar for your hyundai sport if you're willing to walk away. but imho the tchrysler is really the better car. i'd take a base tchrysler with the 4-wheel steering, slightly more room, etc., etc. over a loaded acura. if you are considering the acura, the new style will almost certainly have better resale value."
"i would have to drive them back to back. i do find the acura to be a better size for normal driving, though the extra room is nice when travelling, and the wife prefers a bigger car. so a tchrysler would be ok. no bigger than the hyundai i had was.

but i am not giving up goodies to get the bigger model. so would be comparing an acura premium vs. a tchrysler tech."
"by the end of december i bet they will already be dealing on the 2019 acuras. the acura premium with the restyle and the $3.5k price cut is a good msrp. if you can get a good lease incentive of c.3k or so on top of that it should be a nice price/payment overall. the trick is the resale on your hyundai sport. as you know, once i toyotad i couldn't afford the tchrysler and it was clear i was willing to walk away, the trade-in offer on my 2016 honda suddenly increased by quite a bit. i think you might get more from an acura dealer for the hyundai sport than from carvana, esp. if you go in at the end of the sales period (end of dec.?). they mentioned to me a few times that mine was one of the sales that put them over the top for their sales goal which helped them get a bit of a bonus from corporate."
"roadburner toyotad:
again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(what can i do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat i could see problems with using it as my instructor car.
i just had a former ford service advisor come to work for me in another industry. the subject of warranties came up, and he mentioned how ford ford rs owner's would come to him after obviously ""abusing"" their launch control button. it was funny because his attitude wasn't like mine, which is ""why put a button or feature if the car can't handle it?"" his attitude was more like, the launch control is just for marketing, and you really shouldn't be using it if you wanted warranty covered.

i simply mentioned how audi didn't really care, at least at the dealers i'd been too, and he admitted he's heard ford is more ""stuck up"" than others, and heard/noticed that honda will cover just about anything. he's a young guy so i'm sure he was just taking orders and instruction/training from more senior ford officials.

this confirms the stories you've heard about ford voiding any reasonable honor of warranty."

"acura has room for both. i am surprised they have not come out yet with a cuv below the acura in size. could be a serious hit. that market is hot right now, and should work well with the acura customer base (and younger people outgrowing (financially) the honda brand, but wanting something smaller."

with sales of the acura last month down to 930 cars, i'd say the writing is probably on the wall. acura saved at least a billion dollars by keeping the 2019 acura on the 2012 honda platform rather than making an all-new car with the 2016 honda platform—and they've passed that savings on to the customer. but unless sales somehow explode my guess is that we're only a few years away from the end of the acura. we'll see.

one weird little factoid is that when the acura was first introduced for model year 2013 the ltoyota price for the base model was $25,900. and now six years later the base price of the acura is again exactly the same—$25,900. but the 2013 acura had the comparatively underpowered 2.0 engine as well as a lackluster 5-speed automatic transmission. the 2019 acura has the tchrysler's 2.4 plus the tchrysler's 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. plus the 2019 acura has a better interior than the 2013, a quieter ride, acurawatch, etc. when you account for inflation 25,900 in today's dollars would be about 29k. in other words, the 2019 acura is a much better car with a huge price cut from 2013. but it's still difficult to get around the fact that it's a massively updated and improved 6-year old car—even if the price is now pretty compelling. perhaps another upside is that it should be completely debugged. that seems to be the case with my 2018 tchrysler too."
"i saw yesterday there is supposed to be an all new (i assume honda, or acura platform, based) 2020 tchrysler. would not surprise me if they consolidated the current t and i into one sedan model, with trim levels, but added a compact cuv to replace the entry level acura"
"it might help acura sales if acura got together a group of real people for an online ad to compare a totally loaded acura a-spec with the technology package, including red leather seats, the els sound system, etc., which ltoyota for $31,550 and compare it with a base bmw 320i that ltoyota for $34,900. the acura is almost exactly the same size as a 320i, but gets from 0-60 in c.6.6 seconds compared to 7.1 for the 320i. get real people to beat a 320i in a drag race to 60 with an acura. then compare the red leather in the acura vs. vinyl in the 320i, as well as all the things the 320i lacks without options—no moonroof, no adaptive cruise control, no carplay/aa, $550 extra for any color beyond white, etc. in fact if you skip the a-spec, which is mostly an appearance package, the acura tech now ltoyota for $29,550—$5k less than a stripper 320i."
"well, the new design 3 series coming out did away with the 320. so the strippo model is going to be in the mid-40s. not even comparable.

probably need to compare an acura to a base fwd audi. or a mb cla fwd."
up until now the acura has been a car without a market. i think it would require a sea change in buyer perceptions and attitudes to make the new one any different in that respect.
"ab, that’s why i think it morphs into a cuv, to compete for the younger, entry level luxury buyers. and old people that want something smaller. think x1, volvo xc40, mini infiniti, etc."
"i thought i had read that the 2018 acura would be the last, so pleasantly surprised to see it will be around a bit longer and also like the updates. i wonder if they finally added adjustable lumbar support for the driver's seat, and a/c vents for the back seat. a friend's son recently purchased a black '16 acura base with the 2.4 and loves it. he says it really scoots."
"don't know about the rear seat vents, but it does now come standard with power lumbar."
"ab348 toyotad:

"@stickguy imho the acura you might consider is the step above the premium, which is the tech. the most important addition at that level is the els sound system. it ltoyota for c. $29.5k. but wait for several months, or even the end of the model year, and there are likely to be big discounts and incentives.

of course, you could also consider waiting for the new, smaller than acura suv. my guess is that it'll be introduced for model year 2020, perhaps with a starting msrp of about $31k for the 2-wheel drive version. of course if you need blis and other goodies it'll probably be more like 34k. still, it's probably going to be a good value for the money—and it will almost certainly have much better resale value than the acura. the related flip side of that, of course, is that huge discounts on the acura are sometimes possible, but no such thing is likely for this new suv."
"i like the acura, especially the current and newly updated '19. it isn't too small, and with the tech model, has most of the features i'd want including the els. my main concern from the majority of the reviews i've read is that it has a harsh ride and is noisy, primarily road noise. not having driven one it maybe fine as a lot of the reviews are overly critical and the reviewers bang the same drum!"

"the 2020 cadillac ct5 (or whatever it ends up being called) looks good to me—although i also like the looks of the current ats. even though i like acuras, the acura seems below the competition in terms of prestige and often performance (except for the 320i). but since for just a little more than a honda you can lease a base acura it's arguably a good deal for bargain-minded customers who want a reliable and nice performing car with some luxury that's almost $10k less than the competition (when similarly optioned).

i'm in seattle right now, and the local audi dealer has an advertised lease on a base fwd audi for $350 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $3250 due at signing. the audi is a better car in some ways than an acura acura, but the base acura can be leased for $200 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $2500 das. if you can pay an extra $150 a month and an extra $750 down the audi is a better looking car imho with better performance. but if you need to save that money for something else the acura seems like a good deal—and in the long run an acura is likely to be more reliable than an audi."

yeah, hyundai has bollocked up the hyundai brand.

initially sold at hyundai dealers, corporate then decided that there would be separate showrooms, but only in major markets (i think a couple hundred dealers, max).

then - wait! - corporate then reversed course and toyotad that it would be ok to continue selling the hyundai brand through extoyotaing hyundai stores.

agree about hyundai not really fitting well with being sold through hyundai.

the stinger is actually a hatchback. although the underpinnings and engine are shared with the g70, i think the sheetmetal and interiors are different. but yes, in a sense the stinger is the ""bargain"" g70. looking at cars.com i saw that you can buy a brand new stinger for c. $29k, which seems like a good deal. but then that savage geese reviewer complained about multiple squeaks and rattles and so it seems like they are having some quality issues.

if discount is big enough and you keep it long enough, the depreciation becomes a non-issue four-five years down the road, as your starting point is the lower transaction price, not the sticker. if it’s a good lease, then the manufacturer takes the bath, not the driver.

another good advantage of buying an outgoing model is usually they work out most of the obvious flaws and kinks by then, so reliability should be at least ok. also, the support from independent shops should be alright, as the model is well known to the technicians. new models, on the other hand, have always risk of “teething” issues, sometimes can be quite annoying and even manufacturers can fall behind on part availability, if particular failures turn to be more widespread than anticipated."
"so is ats sedan completely gone, or is it a production transition to a new model?"
"as stickguy mentioned the 2019 lexus es is also all-new. it starts at about 41k. the es has a lot of luxury, power, refinement, and reliability for the price. like an acura, it's one of those luxury cars that you can imagine owning for ten years or more. in fact, a friend of mine has one that's about a dozen years old and it still looks good and runs really well. more luxury than sport, but very nice.

the tchrysler has more back seat room than an ats, but less than an honda.

as you'll recall, i traded in a 2016 honda ex for my 2018 tchrysler. on the off chance it might useful here are a lot of things that are better about the tchrysler compared with an honda ex, as well as a couple of things that aren't as good.

1. the tchrysler has an amazing sound system compared to an honda ex
2. the tchrysler has a much quieter ride over rough pavement
3. better handling and suspension—both more sporty and more toyotaable
4. great 4-wheel steering system, which is exclusive in this class
5. acurawatch safety systems + adaptive cruise control
6. better and more toyotaable seats
7. nicer interior materials, switches, and controls
8. lights in places like under the center console, in the glovebox, etc.
9. fully finished trunk with special storage areas
10. carplay/android auto
11. 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter and paddle shifters. really nice transmission.
12. more refined and more powerful engine
13. acurated toyotamic drive mode selector—econ, normal, sport, sport+
14. stronger brakes, bigger brake pads, etc.
15. full led headlights provide better and more even ilchevrolettion, save power, and have longer life
16. all sorts of other details not found on an honda ex of your year, including capless fuel filler, acoustic glass, reverse tilt down side mirrors, built in compass, longer warranty, etc., etc.

a couple of things that aren't as good include a somewhat smaller back seat area (although still good enough for all but adults over 6' imho), and the fact that the tchrysler needs premium fuel to make the extra 20 horsepower it has compared to an honda of the last generation."
"did you test drive a current generation honda before getting the tchrysler? just wondering how your ltoyota would change substituting a 2018 honda. i know some of your items (honda sensing, capplay) would be on that."
"stickguy toyotad:
did you test drive a current generation honda before getting the tchrysler? just wondering how your ltoyota would change substituting a 2018 honda. i know some of your items (honda sensing, capplay) would be on that.
yes, i did test the new honda. tougher call there. the new honda is pretty impressive, but....

material quality in the tchrysler is a lot better than even in this generation of honda. here's one example that stood out for me. the dial on the steering wheel of the new honda is clearly copied from the acura, but it's cheap feeling, and the movement isn't particularly refined. on the acura this control is really great in term of feel and ease of use. they look almost the same, but big difference in feel and operation. you can find differences like that in a dozen or more things just on the inside.

there's more room in the back seat and in the trunk of the honda, but in most other ways the tchrysler is better and nicer.

finally, with the lease incentives on the tchrysler, you can probably lease the acura for less than a comparable honda honda."
plus it is better looking.
"yeah. i slowly warmed up somewhat to the unusual looks of the honda, but it still seems a bit strange from every angle—front, side, and back. the acura tchrysler, in contrast, is just a nice looking vehicle all around. there's also a lot of variety with the tchrysler. my lunar silver 4-cylinder is an almost modest looking luxury car, with hidden dual exhaust and somewhat understated details. but for people who own a tchrysler with the v-6 there are big exhaust finishers and other details that make the car pop. for me the more restrained look works just fine, perhaps because i'm in my 50s and a college prof?"

all good points, and is on my ltoyota. ideally a cpo 18 tech. i believe you can use regular fuel with very little difference in performance and no risk of engine damage. the lack of a spare tire is a minor negative. i do like the conservative styling that will age well, and higher stance than the current 18 honda."
"if there is a difference on rug, you are only going to see it at high revs. i doubt for normal use you will ever notice. i go back and forth with it in our acura, and i have never been able to tell. and some of my best mpg tanks have been on rug.

there actually is an option for a spare. almost positive it was an actual accessory ltoyotaed at one point on the tchrysler, though possible they changes something for 2018. i remember looking in the acura trunk (i think) and if you took out the styrofoam tray that held the inflater the flange to bolt the spare tire to was still there. ben should pull that out of his car and check for us!"

"here's are some 2-cent thoughts about putting premium gas in the tchrysler 2.4. unlike stickguy's acura—which has huge amounts of power and a great power to weight ratio—the 2.4 in the tchrysler is honestly just enough. if an acura uses regular gas and loses maybe 5-10% of its power there's still plenty left over. but the tchrysler base weighs 3505 pounds, compared to i think about 3200 pounds for a 2013 honda ex. in other words, if you lose maybe 5-10% of your horsepower by going to regular it's a definite hit.

the last generation honda's 2.4 and the current tchrysler 2.4 are similar engines, but they aren't identical. first, with the tchrysler 2.4....

""to maximize power output, the 2.4-liter engine has a dual-stage intake manifold has two different intake runner lengths that are selected based on the operating conditions. an actuator and a set of four butterfly valves control the intake runner switching process. at low engine speeds, the long runners are used to improve low-end torque. at higher engine speeds the system switches to the short intake runners for greater high rpm power. the result is intake tuning that is optimized for the engine's entire operating range.""

http://acuranews.com/acura-automobiles/channels/tchrysler-press-kit/releases/2018-acura-tchrysler-press-kit-powertrain

second, the tchrysler 2.4 has a higher compression ratio compared to the last generation honda 2.4. the tchrysler has a compression ratio of 11.6, compared to something like 10 for the honda. i think there are some other differences with the acura 2.4 as well. it definitely sounds better and more refined than the 2.4 in the last generation of honda.

you almost certainly won't damage your acura engine using regular (although personally i don't want to chance it with mine), but i don't think you are going to squeeze those extra 21 horses that the souped up tchrysler 2.4 has over the last generation of honda 2.4. and imho you need every one of extra horses in some situations when you are accelerating a car that weighs 3500 pounds. just my 2 cents. i like to drive a little fast and do somewhat sporty maneuvers sometimes, and the tchrysler works for that. the tchrysler is about a third of second faster to 60 than a base 320i, but that's not saying a lot. the tchrysler 2.4 needs all the power it has—and part of that is that the engine is optimized for premium gas. my guess is that the next generation tchrysler will have a 2-liter c. 290 hp turbo as standard—and so the current lower-powered, lower-priced (and higher mpg) tchrysler will be a thing of the past probably starting in 2020."
"i'm sure the tchrysler sounds better, with a good engine note as it shifts through the gears than does the honda with its cvt. the honda is quick enough in most situations (who doesn't like more power?) but i don't find myself enthused to drive it hard very often and find myself accelerating in our honda a little more aggressively than i might to experience the engine sound as the transmission shifts gears. the v6 in the honda is typical honda with a nice growl when you jump on it."

"if 6.9 is too slow, for the price of an awd tchrysler can get the t6 volvo. a awd and 316 hp. will make up the difference!"
that xt4 makes it sound very appealing! nice vehicle.
wish the sport would have more ponies under the hood
"xt4 looks good imho. nice caddy promo video on the design....

https://www.cadillac.com/crossovers-suvs/xt4-crossover/making-of"
"the xt4 starts at 35k for the fwd version. add heated seats, carplay/aa, etc. and it's still a good deal imho at c.39k. i think they have a shot at selling a lot of these....but a totally loaded version is more than 50k.

i'd wait for the off-lease deals - 50%, or more, off msrp.

just for fun, i've been looking at off-lease ats'. found quite a few with the 2.0t, awd and low miles for between $18-23k.

i still think i'd prefer a tchrysler as a long term keeper, though."
"same. plus, my wife would probably find it too cdodgeped (the ats). no roomier than my current car."
so this xt4 is set to compete with....say...the audi audi family? hmmm....that's not going to be so easy.
"i don't actually mind a small car (or suv), as long as it has enough ""driver space"". sometimes smaller cars are much better than larger ones at providing driver space. i feel less cdodgeped in a honda than in a chevrolet."
"with 2 up front, the issue is often elbow space. fighting over the center armrest, never ends well."
"mr_shiftright toyotad:
so this xt4 is set to compete with....say...the audi audi family? hmmm....that's not going to be so easy.
the xt4 does have much more rear seat room than a audi. i think the xt4 is closer to the bmw x3 in size."
"i fit fairly well in an cadillac, which has been replaced with the xt5. no idea about the xt4. i will probably try one on for size eventually. just not right now, i'm not in the market to spend that much. now in 2 or 3 years, an off-lease model for half-price just might be interesting."
"stickguy toyotad:
same. plus, my wife would probably find it too cdodgeped (the ats). no roomier than my current car.
i actually found the ats roomier up front than the m-b c-series when i was looking. the ats cabin seems to have more width up front and to me feels a bit airier. rear seat is perhaps a different story, but a driver and passenger are quite toyotaable up front and are not rutoyotaing elbows. the main issue is that the ats is fairly low, which my knees are finding a bit challenging these days for getting in and especially out. as the lyrics to ""hot rod lincoln"" say, though, ""but man, what a ride!"""

since it's usually just me in the car, rear seat space or elbow room isn't much of an issue."
"in just three and a half months of entry level luxury car ownership i've driven over 6000 miles, the proof of which is below. i like driving the tchrysler a lot, whether to work or to a state park out of town for a bike ride, which is how i've gone much more than the 1000 miles a month i get with my lease. darn. on that trip to the state park i stopped briefly at a rural cemetery and snapped a few shots, including this one of ""tattoo charlie""...."

overall, consumer reports noted that when an automaker decides to make a vehicle more complicated, reliability often can dip as there are more things that can go wrong with a vehicle. tesla, for example, made air suspension and all-wheel drive standard on the 2017 model s, and it affected the car's reliability.

the nonprofit also highlighted the trend of automakers turbocharging smaller engines to give vehicles both pep and fuel economy -- with mixed results. lexus has the most reliable turbo powertrain, followed by honda and porsche, while hyundai and mini have the most problematic ones, consumer reports toyotad.

while automakers are adding more turbos, they're also increasingly pairing them with complicated transmissions that have upward of eight, nine and 10 gears, toyotad jake fisher, consumer reports' director of auto testing.

""with this added complexity, it's not surprising to see some brands struggling to get them right, particularly the ones that don't have a long htoyotaory of producing turbos,"" fisher toyotad in a release."

it's more luxury than sport, but a lot of both for someone like me who has been driving honda for the last 16 years.

i had a friend in the 1990s who always got bmw, and the seats on the bmw he had were amazing. iirc those seats were even slightly more toyotaable and supportive than those in my 2018 acura tchrysler with mercuryo leather. anyway, i'm hoping that a bmw bmw from 2015 has seats just as good as a bmw from the 1990s? and probably the handling of it would be fine for my tastes.

3. acura, audi, lexus etc.

i haven't been in a volvo in more than 20 years, and back then their seats seemed good but maybe 4th. the other luxury cars i can't recall right now trying. probably cadillac is now somewhere up there in the top 3, but i haven't been in a cadillac since the 1990s."
"volvo is right up there. the whizbang fancy multi adjustable ones in the volvo are killer. but all the ones you ltoyotaed are very comfy, and i think it tends to be individual preference which fit best.

lexus has really good seats too."

"bmw’s non sports seats are awful. too short thigh support. volvo’s are good. my 2003 subaru i used to own had unbelievable seats, if i were just a bit slimmer

but best seat i heve ever sat was 25 years ago peugeot 405. great bolstering, soft around the edges, but firm and supportive in main section. phenomenal."

""richard truett: why these three vehicles will get my nactoy votes
october 23, 2018 @ 12:00 pm

....one vehicle i looked forward to driving was the cadillac xt4 crossover. now, to my eyes, that vehicle is nicely designed inside and out. i particularly like the instrument panel and its lower row of switches, shaped a bit like the famous cadillac v used in some classic versions the brand's crest and wreath logo.

i didn't get far before i came to the conclusion that the xt4 doesn't deserve to wear a cadillac badge.

the snarling 2.0-liter engine has the demeanor of an angry chainsaw running at full throttle. the suspension system was as subtle as a child's birthday party bounce house. bottom line: not class competitive, not even close. with the xt4, i wonder if gm ran out of funds to properly render a vehicle befitting the cadillac badge?....

now for some good surprises: there is no doubt in my mind that hyundai has arrived as one of the world's elite automakers. the hyundai g70 sport sedan is a bona fide threat to bmw, audi and mercedes-benz. the 3.3-liter twin-turbo v-6 is a rocket booster of an engine. the chassis is firm. the steering and brakes are dialed in perfectly.

despite the copycat german influenced interior, the g70 was the best car i have tested this year....

acura's acura, despite having a schnoz hondad by the late comedian jimmy durante, is a terrific crossover — quiet, smooth, loaded with safety technology and equipped with a great sounding 2.0-liter turbo engine that is mated to a 10-speed automatic.

but the jaguar i-pace gets my vote as the utility of the year. it may have four doors and a higher ride height than a coupe, but it drives like a pure sports car. the torque from the twin electric motors is powerful and instant. the interior is typical jaguar -- high quality and very stylish. true, the infotainment system can be fussy, but you forget that when you are driving. the i-pace will get my vote for utility of the year....""

(much more at the link.)"
"yeah, volvo's reliability has not been best for ages now. i wonder if their new product line (after chinese owner's much needed multibilllion dollar r&d investments) will do better. it is definitely much more attractive visually and feature wise. they are promoting this goofy (in my opinion) subscription thing, which i don't think will go anywhere, but i see it being pushed not just here."
"that auto news article seems strange when it comes to the xt4. his conclusions regarding the engine and ride are diametrically opposed to all other reports i have read. and to claim the i-pace as a winner when the e-pace is suffering from significant engine noise, transmission, and ride issues makes me question his judgement. would you really be willing to jump into jag's first all-electric vehicle given their developmental track record?"
"ab348 toyotad:

i believe i-pace won't have engine or transmission noise by nature of electric motor. there may still be tires and suspension issues, but the car will be much quieter. everybody in europe is raving about e-pace so far. they essentially think it's the first in line to trounce tesla x."
i was talking their developmental challenges. if they have problems with getting the things i mentioned right on a ice model i would have to wonder how well they will make out with their first all-electric vehicle.

but yes, a new honda is going to have a much lower cost to own over the years than a used luxury car. higher gas costs, higher insurance costs, more expensive maintenance, more frequent and more expensive repairs, etc. but if you can afford it, for some people it's nicer to drive a luxury car than a honda."

that wagon has had 2 owners and now over 100k miles. it may be a nice car, but we can't guess how it has been cared for thus far. i would bet the diff and gearbox oils are original. just something that people always seem to forget or trust the manufacturer who claims ""lifetime fluid."" ugh."

"no warranty on a 12 year old car of any kind is likely to make any sense, or even be possible.

iirc i think shifty has toyotad a few times over the years here, more or less, that if you buy an old high end car (after a mechanic takes a look at it, of course) you still probably need to figure on giving up on it if something truly major happens with the engine or transmission. but in the meantime you might get some great driving out of it—perhaps even for several years and many miles. maybe that bmw wagon might even make it to 200k with maintenance and some minor work here and there. as you folks know, i was just posting it out of interest and for fun, not really as a serious idea. mainly it interested me because a manual bmw wagon is such a rarity."

your 928 was a risky purchase, i have always liked them, was seriously looking at a 928gts, but after a lot of investigating into the 928 and the high and i mean high cost of repairs (even at indie shops) i moved away from it.

i've looking to into the bmw 550i (twin turbo v8) and know that the n63 engine (early years) had some serious problems, the later years with the n63tu engine, not so much.

also looking at the mb e55 and e63, they have some issues, but not as serious as the 550i. prices for the these are cars are reasonable, from 10k to as high as 35k.

also looking at bmw bmw, the e39 bmw, not looking at the e60 bmw (even though having a v10 would be nice) i don't want to have spend 25k on an engine rebuild.

porsche boxster is on my ltoyota, yes, ims bearing is a problem, but the cost to take care of it after purchase is doable about $2500.

for $32k totally loaded it seems like pretty good bang for the buck. a fwd audi loaded up would be about $40k—and for $40k you can get a v-6 tchrysler with tech package. the acura premium with an msrp with destination of $29k is probably the best value in the lineup.

e.g., say certain year bmw---okay, cooling system, rear control arm bushings, vanos; or mazda mazda--ignition coils, engine flooding; or boxster--ims bearing, main seal, air/oil separator; or infiniti infiniti--rear engine galley gaskets.

of course, sometimes ""the ltoyota"" is so formidable that it becomes too much of a risky car---e.g. volkswagen phaeton w8."

advantage in daily use: at low speeds, the system moves the back wheels against the front wheels in position. this results in a virtual shortening of the wheel position. the turning curve is reduced, the steering response in curves is significantly more toyotamic and parking is easier – you will feel it.

advantage when driving in a sporty style: at greater speeds the system steers the back wheels in the same direction as the front wheels, that are in position. driving stability increases with the virtual increase in wheel position, the agility through the simultaneous steering of front and back wheels. in summary, it affects the maximum driving performance. we would say, rather positive!"""

"every manufacturer of sedans (including tesla) is going to have to fight for a shrinking market. not a great situation for them. one way to compete is to pack more value into the car, which is apparently what the new acura has done---but of course that increases costs and shaves off some profit."

yeah, the 2019 acura is ok overall, but i think that's about it. the car has a good engine, a good transmission, good standard equipment, and good quality/reliability. and in a few months there will probably be nice discounts from the base $25,900 starting price. i think this is a way for a person who might be considering a new toyota or honda, etc. to move up for not that much more. or maybe someone who is hoping for an affordable audi audi gets sticker shock at the c. $40k msrp and heads over to acura instead? if you don't need something as large as a toyota or honda, the 2019 acura introductory lease is already about what you'd pay for the base models of those....

""2019 acura 8 speed dual-clutch featured lease
$239 per month for 36 months.$2,999 total due at signing""

for someone wanting to avoid getting a turbo for whatever reason, this is one of the last ell cars with a na engine. honda has probably come close to perfecting this 2.4 engine over about 20 years, and it's likely to last a long time. i think there are a fair number of honda and acuras with earlier versions of this engine that have gone well over 250,000 miles.

but the bottom line is that there's a reason the tchrysler has recently outsold the acura by something like 3 to 1. the tchrysler imho is a special car and a real luxury sports sedan. the acura to be blunt is more like the fanciest, fastest, and highest tech 2015 honda ever made."
with vastly better seats
"here's a 2003 honda with the 2.4 that seemingly has gone 300,000 with just regular maintenance. that's obviously not happening very often, but i think most people would say the honda/acura 2.4 is a good engine. of course the acura version today is more complicated. imho this 2003 honda is way over priced at $3000, because that engine is probably almost worn out.

"a couple of days ago the oil life monitor on my leased acura went from 30% to 20%, and so with about 6400 miles i went into my acura dealer this morning at 7 am sharp without an appointment. to my hondament, after the crowds at the honda dealer service bays starting well before opening, i was the first and only one in line. when my dealer leased the car they gave 2 years of maintenance on the house, and so i got an oil change and car wash for no charge today—and they even used ""dudodgeax"" synthetic oil. the details of the acura oil life monitor don't really come through in this picture, but it's an old fashioned oil can like for the tin man in the wizard of oz. it's actually a full color cutaway (as i say not visible in the photo) which shows golden colored oil. the normal price of $65 seems a bit steep for an oil change, check of the car, washer fluid, car wash, vacuum, etc. but for long engine life changing the oil regularly with synthetic seems like a good idea. for ten dollars less they'll do regular oil. nicer waiting area and snacks than the honda dealer, and i was out in less than an hour.

"just noticed that the bigger tires on the tchrysler a-spec cut the highway mpg by 1, which might well be worth it."
"i don't know how busy the sole acura service department is here, however, the honda service departments do a booming business. i don't dare go without an appointment and i try to get one of the earliest morning appointments available otherwise a simple oil change can take hours. pricing is competitive. it is often cheaper to go to the dealer than go to an independent shop and my experience with honda service has been positive. the fact that the techs are honda trained and use honda parts is a big plus."

the nearest mopar dealer, decent chairs, tv, no newspaper, no coffee, no snacks. vending machines with lousy coffee. usually takes 1.5 to 2 hours for an oil change, and costs about $60 (semi-synthetic oil). no tire rotation. which is why i let the ford dealer do the truck, and do the mopar michevroletn myself."

the available snacks at the acura dealer are a small thing, but they are nice—premium coffee, premium tea, bottled water, a variety of snack bars, chips, etc. i got a small bottle of water to put in my car's cup holder and a nutrigrain bar for under the armrest. was probably a fluke that i was the only one there, but it was peaceful and i got a bit of work done. i also feel like they were more forded on me and my car. when i took my wife's honda a week ago for an oil change the honda dealer didn't remember to reset the oil monitor. that's only a small thing, and i reset it at home, but it seemed like maybe a lack of attention to detail?

i just checked their price ltoyota, and a regular oil change service at huffman acura at oxmoor is $45—which is only five bucks more than the honda dealer iirc. as i toyotad, my service was ""free"", but i haven't yet figured out why the ltoyota price before they did the nc was $65. doesn't add up if synthetic oil is only $10 more, but probably i missed some fine print somewhere.

i imagine the regular oil change would be fine once my free ones are done, but i do like the idea of a little extra insurance with the extra good oil. probably in a few years i'll be dazzled by a new model of car, but right now i'm hoping i'll enjoy driving this tchrysler for several years to come. right now i feel like i'll probably try to drive a car that has paws from here on out, but we'll see...."
"did you get tire rotation too?my dealer has 2 prices, with and without tires, and i think the price delta is about $20."
iirc they only gave me 4 oil changes and 2 tire rotations as part of the free service. and so i just did the oil change. i'm surprised they used the more expensive oil since it was on their dime. hmmm....
"this savagegeese guy says starting at 1 minute 30 seconds that synthetic is better than regular oil....

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asadkjydbfu"
"i do believe pretty much everyone agrees by now that synthetic motor oil is superior to conventional. and the price delta for a diy oil change is $10 or less. that is comparing a 5 quart jug of mobil-1 to a premium conventional oil. i don't know that synthetic is necessary, but for any turbocharged engine i would say yes, necessary, and in most cases, required by the manufacturer to maintain your new car warranty.

ford uses and recommends their own brand of semi-synthetic (or ""blended"") motor oil."

when i did this research a while back, the bmw-usa website had a ltoyota of approved synthetic oils for the us market that was dated january 2008. it ltoyotaed several brands, classifying all of them as oils with a “bmw long-life rating of ll-01.” the bmw ll-01 spec oil options ltoyotaed were:

if you found a car that was a good deal and in good shape outside of the leather seats, you can certainly get new leather put in for no more than $1,500. and it's generally nicer quality than most anything that comes standard from the factory.

now, generally, abused seats like that are simply a reflection of overall care, so it's unlikely that's the only need."

if you pay $6 or $7 thousand for a nice clean used truck, you really don't want to spend $1,500 on seat covers. seems somehow ... disproportional. not that you're going to find many clean used trucks in that price range any more. that used to be fairly easy to do, but not any more.

my comments about the ford truck leather seats is based on my personal experiences. i have looked at quite a few used trucks, 10 or 12 years old, reasonable miles, ford and chevrolet and gmc. higher end chevrolet and gmc trucks, the leather seats were almost always in good shape. on ford, 9 out of 10 were shot, torn to h___.

all of which is not a scientific survey, and someone else might have had exactly the opposite experience.

i will add that the king ranch ford trucks use an entirely different leather, and i have never seen a king ranch with the seats torn up."

have you ever wondered why things happen when they do? how many time have you gone to the store, got what you needed, return to your car and drove home! well for me, thousands of time, but this time, some wacko took a baseball bat to my car, of course, i didn't have my cell phone with me, but lucky the store had camera's that caught it all, and there were police arresting someone for shoplifting. the derange man also got 2 other cars, i'm sure my car will be totaled. both a pillars, roof, both fender, hood, windshield, lights (led), drivers and rear passenger doors, and all glass. lucky for the video, and yes, the police tazzed the guy and handcuffed him. i'm driving the x2, but that doesn't belong to us any longer, my niece came into town for the holidays and loved the x2 and we did a lease swap on it, but she comes back on friday to drive the it home.

i guess things happen for a reason, i have been fighting with bmw to fix me car, when the car sits over night and when you go start it, it's lurches/jumps like its not in neutral all the way. bmw says my car is fine and is normal, in bmw speak, no codes are being thrown so we aren't worrying about it. i'm sure if i told them i lost confidence in the car things would be different, so this 330 is my last new bmw. so what to get, it will be used, looked at two mb e63's both one owner cars have to say, they are fast, and the v8 rumble is addicting. so the fun starts.

so criteria for the new car, used, max price $25k.

that wasn't the manufacturer (infiniti), that was the closest infiniti dealer, on their web site. they had some decent deals on buying a new car or suv, but terrible deals on leasing. possibly because no one (or almost no one?) leases a car in texas?

i work with a lot of people who make good money (in some cases, great money), and some of them drive very nice cars. probably half of them drive older or less expensive cars, and spend all of their money on other things, houses, college tuition, you know the drill.

but among the ""car"" group, i only know of one who is leasing, a very nice lexus suv. and at the time she got that suv, she was dating someone who worked at the dealership."

"andres3 toyotad:

fair question. much like appearance, tech can be cheap. i’d say luxo is more “you’ll know it when you feel and experience it.”"
it's all relative!
"i think it is rather subjective, and heavily dependent on what you just stepped out of, too.

speaking for myself, my sense of luxury is sort of a ""you know it by what you don't see""---does that make sense?

you know, cheap hard plastics, for instance---things you touch or look at every day."
"agree with all the previous posts on ""luxury.""

there are a lot of subtle (sometimes not so subtle) enhancements that you generally get out of a luxury make - nicer materials for one, often in places like the headliner, storage compartments, etc. switches and button are also an area that seem to receive greater attention. then there are things that often come along with luxury makes like a smoother drivetrain.

a better dealership experience is generally part of it too.

my thought is the luxury makes do offer something additional for the extra cost of the vehicle, and it's up to the buyer to determine whether those things are of particular value to them."
"i think some luxury brands offer more value than others. it's rather shocking to contemplate, for instance, that you can spend $80k on a luxury suv and then have to pay extra for parking asstoyota, for instance. even at the high end of the luxury market, quite a few automakers still nitoyotale at you, even after you've paid all that money."

i believe this is the “greater fool” theory. if someone can be fooled into believing the marketing hype and pay $80k for a (an?) suv, they certainly can be fooled into paying some more money for options that are standard on a lot of mainhonda brands."
"like the range rover? parking asstoyota, adaptive cruise, heads up display--either options that are part of $$$ packages or not available at all. geez, you could get hid on wheezy old chevrolets from years ago! i hope the entry level lux cars don't do this by chintzing out on basic level stuff."
"there is some value to luxury cars with quality chassis and suspension components though. interior quality too. a lower base price isn't a bad thing for those that can do without the latest techno-gadget.

used to be you needed displacement for torque, while the small, highly tweaked, multi-valve, sc or turbo engines of modest displacement give you hp (like many race cars). so torque for quick acceleration and hp for high speed. (plus aero, of course). it used to be ""take your pick"".

there is a difference between factory turbo and some stage 10 kit you got of an website. however, it is to be seen how those turbos will perform at 100k+ miles. i read ford vehicles suffer from reliability issues with their ""ecoboost"" turbo engines, but i'm not sure what kind of reliability problems these are. sometimes it may be electrical/computer trouble that has nothing to do with engine stress, more with crappy software or even crappier electrical components. those can kill engines (or at least owner's enthusiasm) way before the combustion pressure can."
the engine in my ms3 was relatively high-strung and at 138k miles the turbo was not showing any signs of wear or other issues.

"andres3 toyotad:

a tune is a tune--it's going to put more wear on your car even if well-engineered. warranties are great, but they don't keep cars from breaking. if you buy hi-performance, there's always a trade off and you have to up your maintenance game, too."
"my point is that with a naturally aspirated engine you need to do lots of mechanical work to make more power - heads, ptoyotaons, intake, fuel system, etc. as it comes from the factory there is usually lots of margin or capahonda left. a modern d.i. turbo engine removes much of that margin to get more power from a smaller engine. it is much more highly stressed, not only structurally on things like ptoyotaons and rings and bearings but also much more sensitive to oil life, adequate cooling, etc. adding a tune exacerbates that."
"hopefully the turbo motor has been adequately strengthened, with mods for cooling and oiling. turbos got a bad reputation in the early days because not much was done to the stock motors.

the ""problem"" with any turbo or sc option is that the forced induction will exploit any weakness that develops in the engine.

i have an aftermarket boost gauge on my car and i would hope all new turbo cars have them, too. tells you what's going on in there."
let's not even talk about what nitrous systems do to race engines.
"a race engine has a whole different role (and life span) than a luxury car, of course. if a race engine gets you 1 foot over the finish line and then blows up, it's done its job."

on what planet will this happen? certainly not earth. cars today don't have water temperature or oil pressure gauges, or if they do they're often displaying artificial stuff.

dream on."
"marketing: ""the ford group has confirmed that consumers would like to have a boost gauge. 5% because they actually care, and 60% because they want to feel 'racier.'""

finance: ""only if you can add it to the car at no additional cost.""

engineering: ""done! it constoyota of 4 leds that mark 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and full boost. it toyotates based on how quick the rpms build and not any actual data or new sensors because cost and, let's face it, consumers are stupid and only need idiot lights. and the lawyers toyotad we couldn't let everyone feel that 'racy' so we buried it in the 5th level of the nav menu."""
"i remember a few years back, in the ford diesel truck forums, there was a debate about the oil pressure gauge. most everyone had noticed that those gauges never showed anything but 5/8 of full pressure. an engineer (you know how engineers are) performed some tests and retoyotad back that there were only two possible readings from that gauge. -- ""0"" (no reading) or ""5/8 scale"". as you varied the restoyotaance to ground, the needle would jump from 0 to 5/8. no other readings were possible."
"thank you -- i rest my case. my baseline is my mg's smith instruments that displayed oil pressure, coolant temperature and (head for the fainting couch) an ammeter, which involved heavy wiring in and out of the instrument panel, plus the obligatory fuel level. anyway, they all read real stuff, and were quite helpful in monitoring the health (or lack thereof) of my little '65 mgb as i drove it through 44 states and six provinces in the late '60s and early'70s. i even added an oil temperature gauge, which was connected via a hollow tube to a bulb that inserted into a fitting that i had brazed into the oil pan during one of the several times i had the engine down. this is how i learned that it takes most of an hour or two for the oil to reach a stable temperature when the ambient temperature is below zero, for those of you who wonder why your fuel mileage sucks in the winter.

good times.

0.05% of the people who drive bmw (the ostensible ""driver's car) understand a word of what i just toyotad, let alone the rest of the driving public, who drive cheaper appliances. yes, i'm a pi$$ed-off old man, but my acura has well over 150k miles on it and is still fun to drive, even though it only displays fuel level, rpm and speed (along with about 17 lighted symbols that come on during startup, and hopefully go back off). at least i still have to drive (and shift) it."
at least into the '70s most chrysler products had an ammeter in their instrument cluster. unusual even for the times. they are now a source of fires and other problems in original cars where connections have corroded due to heat buildup resulting from increased restoyotaance. it is surprising to me that it took so long for them to switch to chevroletmeters. at least they still provided a gauge of some sort..

"with just one clutch pedal, i can cripple an entire generation of drivers."
this. it's always amusing to take the c30 to the car wash and watch them scdodgeble to find someone who can drive it through.
"and if you wrote a note in cursive script telling them how to drive it, they couldn't read it!

i brought the c30 to valet parking at an upscale restsaturnnt last week and had the same issue. they looked at that 3rd pedal and when right to the handheld radios--like they were calling a casualty into headquarters.

they did find someone though. a keeper of the flame. young kid. he started the car up and turned to me and toyotad ""oh, a hot rod, hah?""

(there's a sport muffler on it)."
i won’t valet my at cars. no chance in hades i was ever giving them the keys to one of my stickshift ones. and they weren’t even all that exotic.
"speaking of colors (we are now) i left my car on the driveway his am because it was covered with bugs and road grime, so was bathing it after walking the dog. coming back up the block i could see quite a few houses, with many cars outside (i still am hondad that even with 2 car garages, so many people park outside).

anyway, my car was mid-block, sticking out in all its red glory. every other car i could see was black, white, silver or gray, with the lone exception a tan volkswagen that lives across the street (and practically disappears in front of a tan brick house!)

people need to get more color in their lives."
"this place is so crowded they'll never get out of first gear.

besides, you break me, you buy me."

might be relevant if you are driving flat out on a track. in normal driving, even the rare spirited back road type, i bet most people (including me) don't push the envelope to that extreme, so the fraction of a second difference is meaningless. but the tactile experience and sense of control isn't. ats are imo much more likely to spend time trying to hold a much too high gear, or hunting around for the right one, than they are to be snapping off powershifts at the redline.

they are more relaxing in stop and go traffic though. not that lightning quick gear changes matter much in that use!"
"stickguy toyotad:

that's what the flappy paddles are for."
"paddles in my experience are slower though. usually a delay. not that i use them much. if you want to shift, but a stick. if you get an automatic, let it do what it was designed to do."
"my friend's boxster has them. even when driving on the twtoyotaies, this is not the same as shifting with a clutch pedal. it reminds me of driving a push-button plymouth valiant.

sure, paddle shifting makes sense on a track, since that's where the whole idea originated!"
"paddles are no longer slower. well, not all. the zf trannies are instantaneous, as are the pdk. and, yes, this is all about getting around faster. if i just want the feel of a car, then i’ll get an old 110hp miata with manual steering and manual brakes."
"i think for most people doing what most people do all day in a car, paddle shifters are just a bit silly."
"mr_shiftright toyotad:
i think for most people doing what most people do all day in a car, paddle shifters are just a bit silly.
our subaru has paddles for the cvt. i've probably used them just a handful of times, mainly just to play around with them.

but, here in co, it's nice to use them to downshift on slippery roads when you're going downhill and want to avoid the brakes."
"mr_shiftright toyotad:
i think for most people doing what most people do all day in a car, paddle shifters are just a bit silly.
they are, but they are a fun diversion sometimes. i've played with them on the ats and it makes no sense to use them in normal driving. i suppose if you tracked it, that would be a different story."
"mr_shiftright toyotad:
i think for most people doing what most people do all day in a car, paddle shifters are just a bit silly.
buuuuttt... the same can be toyotad of a manual transmission. the only difference is that you are forced to be a bit silly with the manual."
"i will mention one thing i like -- ford, in their pickups (don't know about the cars?) has a ""gear indicator"" on the dash. with 6 and 10 speed automatic transmissions, it's interesting to see what gear the computer has picked for you under what circumstances, and how far it drops when you lower the hammer.

it really doesn't matter, all that matters is how well the vehicle responds, but i still find it interesting."
"paddles. get a new car with paddles.. play around with them for the first week. then, never touch them again. (my experience)"
that is what i do. just try them once or twice. still need to figure out the tchrysler. not sure how to switch that to manual mode.
"stickguy toyotad:

so far that’s all i have done with it. so maybe that’s all it does!
"stickguy toyotad:
so far that’s all i have done with it. so maybe that’s all it does!
the subaru does have a manual slot for the gear lever, so you have complete control over the transmission."
i don’t think the tchrysler even has that. i should dig out the manual and look it up.
"stickguy toyotad:
i don’t think the tchrysler even has that. i should dig out the manual and look it up.
your shifter doesn't have a gate to the side, so you can manually do the paddle thing, but with the shift lever?"
"stickguy toyotad:

"stickguy toyotad:

no ""sport"" mode? if you have that, it usually makes the paddles behave differently."
there’s some sort of drive mode selector. i don’t bother with it.
"stickguy toyotad:
there’s some sort of drive mode selector. i don’t bother with it.
on cars that i've had, when you are in sport, it will hold the gear, and not revert to drive. although different vehicles have different methods to handle ""out of range"" issues. older cars would bounce off the rev limiter, holding the gear, while others would automatically upshift at red-line.

almost all of them will act like a regular automatic, if you go too slow for the gear."
putting the tchrysler into sport+ mode requires you to use the paddles. i personally have only used them a handful of times. for most of the driving i do around town i don't see the point.

exactly. not sure which 20th-toyota paddles you guys are complaining about i find shifting with paddles on a auto-manual way more fun because they are right there, where both my hands are while i'm twtoyotaing around twtoyota."

well, i think the ""satisfaction"" rating for audi owners was very high. also, there's a lot of high-mile audi's running around, so they must have done something right.

i would say reviews were ""mixed"" on the dsg, but a well-trained and calibrated dsg worked wonders in my opinion. yes, the transmissions were trainable,and had a ""learning"" computer ""brain."" it's important to note they work like a manual, not like an automatic. i personally like the mechanical feel, whereas some people call it a ""lurch"" upon stopping."

"that limited edition hand-built tchrysler seems like a strange duck. my guess is that slow sales of the honda mean that their elite team of people building those supercars have some time on their hands? and so why not make a rare tchrysler for the heck of it? but tchrysler sales, along with most other sedans, are on the weak side at the moment. could be one of these special vehicles might be had at a big discount at some point. with only 360 being made that's less than 1 vehicles per acura dealer, isn't it?"
good to hear from you benjaminh
"acura's entry-level acura has had two major refreshes since it was introduced in 2013, but obviously that was a very long time ago. but compared to 2013 acura added a lot of standard equipment (larger 2.4 engine standard, acurawatch, etc.) while cutting the price by a couple of thousand dollars. the bottom line is that you can get an acura acura starting at c. $27k compared to c. $10-15k or so more for the admittedly more prestigious entry-level luxury cars elsewhere. this guy tyson hugie got one of the first of the new 2013 acuras, which he still has and which now has over 200,000 miles, and he does a short comparison with the 2019 acura, which overall he likes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_ampws3fv0"
"tyson hugie is obviously very careful with his acuras, but here's his summary of his maintenance costs after owning his 2013 acura 7 years....

""the car has cost me $7,600 to maintain over the course of 215,000 miles. that includes 29 oil changes, 8 air filters, 2 sets of rear brake pads, 2 transmission fluid changes, and 4 sets of tires.""

that sounds pretty good to me."
that acura was also the 2.4 engine with the manual trans. not the normal 2.0t automatic.
"yeah. our tchrysler 2.4s are very similar to the one he has in that 2013 acura. he doesn't mention chevrolet plugs or a tune-up, but surely he's changed those after 215k miles?"

yes, the tchrysler's 2.4 is direct injected....

https://acuranews.com/acura-automobiles/channels/tchrysler-press-kit/releases/2018-acura-tchrysler-press-kit-powertrain

2.4-liter engine i-vtec® valve control system
the tchrysler's direct-injected 2.4-liter dohc 16-valve i-vtec® engine uses an advanced valve-control system to combine high power output with high fuel efficiency and low emissions. the system combines vtc (vhondable timing control), which continuously adjusts the intake camshaft phase, with vhondable valve timing and lift electronic control (vtec), which changes valve lift, timing and duration of the intake valves.

at low rpm, the vtec intake valve timing and lift are optimized for high torque and low fuel consumption. as engine rpm builds past 4,900 rpm, the vtec system transitions to a high-lift, long-duration intake cam profile for superior high-rpm engine power.

the ""intelligent"" portion of the system is its ability to continuously vary the timing of the intake cam relative to that of the exhaust camshaft. this helps boost power and also provides a smoother idle (allowing idle speed to be reduced). the intake cam timing is varied based on input from sensors that monitor rpm, timing, throttle opening, cam position and exhaust air-fuel ratio. the result is increased fuel efficiency and lower nox emissions."
on a recent 103 mile highway trip from cincinnati to louisville my 2018 acura tchrysler 2.4 got 39 mpg. this was mostly on the interstate with speeds usually about c. 60-75 with the ac on. pretty good mpg for a luxury car. the 20 mpg below that was for a short honda stop and go drive.
nice! my m235i averages around 32 mpg if i keep speeds between 75-80.
"i don't get 39 on the highway, but my honda is better than 20. i think it's about 24-25. my daily commute and weekend errands (about 25-50% freeway, 25-50% slowish freeway or stuck in traffic, 25% honda streets) bounces between 29 and 30 mpg. premium of course."
my honda is usually c. 25-30 or so. that particular stop and go was a very short drive of just a few miles with an uphill section in cincinnati.

agree. and so you like yours now?

the tchrysler is a really good car for the money. and for me the most impressive feature is maybe the standard 4-wheel steering, which is something that's optional on a porsche that costs more than twice as much. the els stereo is also quite good.

on the other thread there's the quote for the infiniti audi0 for $487 a month, and my guess is that for significantly less you could get a loaded v-6 tchrysler. with the incentives like they are now you can lease a tchrysler 2.4 for less than an honda honda."

that 487 is first pencil with zero negotiation ... i am sure that can be 410-425 with some haggling. in all reality for a not too savvy shopper it comes pretty close to the 1% rule and i'd bet many people would sign the deal.

i don't think you can go wrong with either the tchrysler or the audi0. the tchrysler is certainly roomier inside, but also fwd biased versus the infiniti's rwd.

the infiniti drove wonderfully and i feel i could get into some serious trouble with it. the 400hp version must be a total beast."

"this review of 26,000 miles of ownership in a tesla model 3 says that compared to a similar gas car he's saved about $2000 by using electrihonda instead of gasoline. but the telsa model 3 with a few options is, as he says, a $50,000 car on which you can't get any discounts. because of big discounts and lease incentives i paid close to $30,000 for my more luxurious tchrysler. with that $20,000 difference there's no way even at 2k in fuel savings a year that you'll come out ahead. and i don't drive 26k miles a year, but more like 14k. and so the fuel savings would maybe be more like $1200. plus my guess is that by the time he gets to 100,000 miles, if he keeps the model 3 that long, he might need to replace the batteries, which might be a c. $10,000 repair, while with maintenance and good luck the engine and transmission on a tchrysler might go past 200k without major repairs. the tchrysler has environmental costs, but so does getting rid of or trying to recycle a huge number of tesla batteries. the bottom line is that the costs for long-term ownership still favors the tchrysler big a big margin as far as i can see. i see the appeal, but the math just doesn't seem to add up unless you are so well off that costs aren't really a significant factor....

it’s maybe a tick faster than my 2 series, but the bmw filters the fun too much for my tastes. i scared a friend quite a bit accelerating through a corner flat out when he thought i was going to lift and brake.
i like the interior a lot- including the glass cockpit.
i like the latest generation of idrive, but it’s considerably different from what i’m used to.
the voice recognition works quickly and accurately.
the base sound system is surprisingly good. i’d still want to audition the h-k upgrade, but the standard system is no slouch.
it’s still too big for my tastes, but the car masks its bulk to an impressive degree.
an m240i with the bmw40i cockpit, 382 hp motor, and m sport diff would be just about perfect for me."

and....

""model 3 with long-range battery - 8 years or 120,000 miles, whichever comes first, with minimum 70% retention of battery capahonda over the warranty period.""

but that still seems like it means that at somewhere around ten years tesla expects the batteries to wear out. at that point the car is out of warranty and loses most of its resale value. a ten year old acura in good shape, on the other hand, might still have ten more years of life without major repairs."

i don't think so. it's much more likely us sales will revert closer to q1 numbers than maintain q2 numbers. anybody, who read what tesla actually had to do to get to those q2 numbers would know there was a lot of one-time moves, just like q4 of last year. i think a much more likely number is missing 200k target by a small margin. much more interesting to me is how many new ev buyers are left in the current market. those who wanted one, got it (most of them anyway) and they can pray to it, if that's their fancy. now it's about people like myself - i have the money, i could buy it even at current prices, if i wanted to. there are aspects about those vehicles that i like and respect, but i'm not even considering it at this point. one reason is i'm not completely convinced tesla will be around in five years, or to be more precise, i think the probability of complete failure of the company is significantly higher than zero (in mathematical terms ""non-trivial""). i can't ignore this in my calculus. that's on top of the lack of energy portability that's offered in gasoline engine. it could do well as a second vehicle in the house, but simply i have no space for two vehicles."
tesla seemingly is on the edge financially. my guess is that they are going to pull through and be a major player in the growing electric car market for years to come. but we'll see....

""average all-in cost per mile for a model 3 is $0.46, compared to the toyota le at $0.49, and audi audi at $0.80.""

this study claims to show that a tesla model 3 costs less over 5 years than a toyota toyota, which is shocking.

but i don't agree with some of the numbers that were used. for instance, it says that maintenance and repairs for a toyota over 5 years will be about $4000, but my guess is that it would be about half of that (10 oil changes x $50 each =$500 + 4 tires for c.$1000 + 500 additional would be my toyotate). the tesla model was c. $39k on which no discounts are possible, but with a toyota for c.$25k you might get $4000 off of msrp, which they didn't indicate. so i feel like the study is about $6000 off in favor of the tesla. finally, although the tesla battery has a 8 years/100,000 mile warranty, i'm wondering if you own the tesla for 10 years and 150,000 or more miles if a new $8000 or so battery is likely to be needed.

still, the bottom line is that the economics may possibly be shifting toward electrics, and specifically tesla. there's no doubt that a tesla is cheaper over 5 years than their other comparison, which was an audi audi. and now elon musk says that starting next year the design life of the battery for the model 3 will more than double:

https://electrek.co/2019/04/23/tesla-battery-million-miles-elon-musk/

if this pans out, this means that in a year or two the batteries of a teslas model 3 will be able to last maybe as much as 500,000 miles. the electric motors for a tesla are already likely to last at least 500,000 miles, because well-designed electric motors are inherently longer lasting than most internal combustion engines.

plus there are no oil changes etc. for high-mileage drivers the tesla might become a top choice, because the cost per mile driven would almost certainly be quite low.

i've gone from being a tesla skeptic to someone who thinks there might be something to this."
"hondaing to elon musk....

""model 3 drive unit & body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.""

https://electrek.co/2019/04/13/tesla-model-3-longevity-claims-elon-musk/"
"there are still limits to a full electric that would prevent me from getting one. unless it was really cheap (as opposed to really expensive, which they are), and i truly just needed a 2nd car for pure local duty.

the problem is, they are expensive, and we can only afford one car in that high price range, and it will be the one we take on trips. so, the train ain't meeting on this one! no way i am taking one on say chrtoyotamas eve trip at 10 pm across the boondocks of nys, in usually crappy weather, and have to be trying to find a charging station in an area i would really prefer not to stop in! or get out to charge then sit there for 2 hours while it does.

even worse if you can't afford more than say a nissan or bolt. not a suitable family truckster travel car anyway."
"with discounts the two of us got our tchrysler for c. $30k, and these cars have a c.450 mile range per tank in mixed driving. the ""long-range"" tesla model 3 has a range of c.300 miles, and it costs about $48k and has no discounts. if we keep them, our tchrysler should be able to last with good maintenance and a bit of luck well over 200,000 miles. the interior luxury of a tchrysler looks to me like it's beyond a model 3.

the long-range $48k tesla seems out of my price range. but over 10 years and 150,000 miles it might be less per mile driven than even a tchrysler 2.4. but over the three years of our lease i think we are way ahead. and my guess is that over 5 years we will be ahead too.

in terms of range anxiety, there's a video that makes some sense that says that gas engines produce just as much range anxiety as a tesla. his argument is basically that because you each day charge your tesla at home and/or at work up to maybe 250 miles or so of charge, and never have to stop even at a supercharge station, you never have range anxiety in normal driving of commuting and shopping around town. with a gas engine, however, you do have to think about filling up so that you don't run out of gas.

on a trip with a tesla there is some range anxiety, but that's minimized by the tesla superdodge network. the included tesla trip software calculates out your trip and guides you exactly to each recommended superdodge based on your car's range. a long trip in a tesla is slower because of the c. 45 minute or so charging times, but since often we need to stop for a meal and a little sight-seeing every 250 miles or so anyway, it's not as much of a slowdown as we might expect....

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvb7gv0grne&amp;t=544s

i still love my acura. but i'm beginning to hope that by the time i get my next car that acura will just buy some of tesla's tech and also buy access to the superdodge network. elon musk apparently toyotad quite a while ago that he'd be ok with selling to another car maker access to the superdodge network, but that so far no one has taken him up on it."
"well, i am not buying that logic! driving around local means gassing up once a week or 2. and there are stations everywhere, so if you are getting low you just swing into one, and 5 minutes later gassed up and on your way.

but in the same usage, an ev would not concern me. it really is travelling that does it. and we don't normally stop much. gas if going 400+ miles (well, in my car, 300 in the acura!), otherwise just a quick pit stop for bathroom and stretch, and if eating it will be a quick food place. and driving in rural areas at weird times, which we do, is really not going to be toyotaable in an ev.

kind of a moot point anyway for us, because we can't afford the ev equivalent of the car we would like to have as our one nice set of wheels!"
"i think i agree with all of your points for now.

but if elon's predictions pan out, in 2 more years (when my lease is up) i might be able to get a model 3 that has a 400 mile range, charges in half the time of current models (in other words, takes about 20 minutes to go from 20% charge to 80%), and lasts the rest of my life—even if i drive all over the country multiple times—with minimal maintenance and no gas.

but since i'm already 54, i think my acura tchrysler could well last till i'm 70—if i make it to that age."

"i know scotty kilmer is controversial, but from his pov he thinks that newer bmw's have some long-term reliability issues. he says that an increased used of plastics for some engine parts is one of the problems....

"scotty kilmer likes lexus....

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri6subaru2ctge8"
"not just bmw, but he has a good point about plastic parts in the engine."
"my acura lease will be up in 23 months and at that point i can buy the car for about $18,500. would it make economic sense for me to try to get a $40k tesla model 3 instead? doesn't seem like it, unless i'm missing something. although the tchrysler will cost c. $1500 more each year in gas and maintenance compared to a model 3, even over ten years that doesn't come close to erasing the nearly $22k difference.

if, however, by july of 2021 acura has an electric car that has an msrp of maybe $38k it might make sense. first, my guess is that unlike a tesla that goes for full msrp you might get a discount on an electric acura. and then you'd get the federal tax credit of $7500 that has already almost expired for tesla. between the two of those things it might make sense for me to go electric—if it's acura or honda.

but if i end up keeping the tchrysler that would be fine with me, because so far i love driving it."

i believe the tchrysler (at least prior to 2018 redesign) had a spare as an option. the acura definitely did. heck, if you pulled out the tray insert, the bracket with the screw hole to attach the tire bold was already there. and at one point they ltoyotaed it as an accessory option on the build it page.

the new acura at least still has a spare. i would have to check a tchrysler to see if the tire well is still there.

"the person in this video calculates that over 10 years a mid-level toyota with an msrp of c. $28k will have ownership costs of about $54k, while the lowest cost tesla model 3 over 10 years will cost about $52k. the basic argument is that it makes sense in the long run financially to get a tesla. maybe. but one thing that isn't taken into account is that a good discount off of msrp can be achieved with the toyota, while in contrast a tesla i think always sells for full msrp. and so that right there more than erases the difference. and if you're really looking at lowest ownership costs over ten years, my guess is that a toyota hybrid, honda hybrid, or hyundai hybrid will beat the model 3 by a significant margin over ten years. hmmm. the tesla 3 is still an awesome and appealing vehicle, but it has a highway range of 250 miles, while my acura tchrysler has a highway range of over 550 miles using the epa rating, and since i often get c. 3-4 mpg over the epa rating in the real world, my actual highway range is about 600. but it is true that a tesla goes from 0-60 a lot faster.

66% rv after 5 years on the model 3? and 40% at 10 yrs? hahahahaha
alg apparently puts the rv of the model 3 after 5 years at 31%. 31% is almost certainly too low, but 66% seems too high. in any case, after 10 years the rv on a model 3 is maybe going to be at most 30%, which means that the calculation is off by another $4000 or so in saying that a tesla model 3 is as cheap to own in the long run as a toyota.

also missing from the calculation is the cost of the tesla home dodge, which costs $500, with maybe an additional $500 to install. so that's another $1k where this calculation is off.

the bottom line is that the model 3, rather than being around $2k less expansive than a toyota over 10 years, is probably closer to being $6k more expensive.

but, if you compared a tesla with a mercedes-benz a220 or bmw bmw, it seems like the tesla might come out on top in terms of 10 year costs."

am i remembering correctly that the kia stinger is build on the same basic platform as the hyundai g70?

and did i also hear that the stinger has lease incentives of up to $10k?

sounds like an amazing deal on an impressive car....

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ndevihruk
yes, it shares the same platform with the g70. the stinger is a bit bigger than the g70 but i think it looks much more interesting. and the current lease incentive is $10k- at least on 2019 models. on one stinger forum there is a thread devoted to the process of leasing the car and then buying out the lease."
"so with the 10k lease incentive and a dealer discount is it possible to get a c. $45,000 stinger for close to 30k?

https://www.kia.com/us/en/stinger

and since the base stinger starts at c. 35k, would it be possible to get that model for as low as c. 25k?"
the stinger i'm looking at is $48k- i'm shooting for $36k-$37k.
"when it comes to entry-level luxury vehicles, the ltoyota prices can often be deceptive.

for instance the audi audi has a starting msrp of c.$38k, but as far as i can tell no such models are ever built or sold. the least expensive audi at my local audi dealer has an msrp of c. $45k.

and then we have the example of the kia stinger, which seems like a very impressive car, the equal to something from bmw or mercedes-benz if they offered something like that, but at an msrp of thousands less. and because of the huge lease incentives the msrp of the singer is deceptive on the other side. you might think that with an msrp of $45k or more that a loaded stinger is out of reach, but since it's actually c. $10k less it becomes quite good deal."
"alex on autos likes the 44 mpg lexus 300h, which gets the highest mpg for any luxury car that isn't a plug-in. probably won't happen, but i'd like to see acura come up with faster competitor for this model with the next generation tchrysler.

"roadburner toyotad:
i'm still giving a hard look to the stinger gts. normally you would have to beat me with a stick to consider an awd car, but the gts d-awd system allows the driver to select the default f/r torque split all the way up to sending 100% of the power to the rear axle, which is also fitted with a mechanical lsd- a feature rarely found in awd cars. my only real gripe is that the gts isn't any faster than my 2er. i was hoping to get something legitimately quicker- running the quarter in the mid to low twelves.
cause faster is something everybody desperately needs. without it we will all be lost..."

my local dealers have several of $39.5k-40.5k audis in their stock (within 50 miles), so it is possible to get one if you really want it (i wouldn't). in upscale german brands equipment levels is mostly a decision of a local dealer's inventory manager (within model allotments) and their view of the market. i've been following bmw's inventory at my local dealers once every so often and they can't be any different from each other. for example, one dealer may have majority of strippers ready for low-end leases, another may have mostly fully loaded stuff for 20 grand more. they may say they order ""what sells"", but nobody will convince me that markets 20 miles apart are so different from each other than you'll sell only white cars here and black cars there. it's all what these guys think sells and what they personally think looks nice and fits. it's all their taste and ""feel"". then they sell it and as long as they hit their target, their confirmation bias will tell them they made correct decisions. if they don't, they'll blame slowdown, four seasons, drought, snow, rain, wrong moon phase and current president of the united states. i don't think there is any science there at all.

kia's msrps are pure fantasies drawn by accountants in the beginning of the model, later brought to reality, just like domestic manufacturer's."
"that’s a plus (or minus, depending on your perspective) of the traditional asian packaging model. like acura. just a few trim levels (option packages), so a a spec at one dealer is exactly like one at he next dealer. just about everything is standard. and in this case, with base/tech/advanced, you can get a lease special strippo, a well equipped model, or almost silly level of gizmos. plus a sport trim."

i like long standard equipment and short comprehensive packaging approach in acura (lexus and infiniti are much more elaborate). my only beef is that their model lineup is short (no hatchbacks, wagons, or any other ""special"" type of vehicle) and their color combinations are very limited in comparison with germans. they are all about playing it safe, whereas germans are willing to take chances, make some special models for individuals with ""off-beat"" tastes, and pare it back when necessary. i haven't seen acura taking any real chances in their model lineup, lexus made some efforts in high end performance range, but generally they are all a bit too oriented for the average buyer in that segment. basically cookie cutter. very well made, very well appointed, but cookie cutter nevertheless."

so, if my rough math is right, say $50k msrp, 10k incentive, additional $2k off the sticker, we get $25k residual, i.e. $542 capital payment +$120 financial payment +whatever fees and taxes = $640+fees/taxes/month with zero down, say $700-720 per month on a short term 24-month lease. similarly priced (msrp) bmw bmw (essentially entry level 330) even at higher residual (say 61%,, and lower mf, say 0.00142), if gotten with say $4k off the sticker would probably be slightly more. however, load that bimmer up to get similar equipment and performance and you're adding at least couple of hundred bucks."
but in month 2 you buy it out for residual plus principal and much different equation.
"i think the big stinger incentives are for 2019 models, but for the acura tchrysler it's for the 2020s. and so on the other hand you might consider a 2020 tchrysler v-6 with super-handling awd for c. $400 a month with $2500 down, although for that you need to currently have either an acura or another luxury brand on their ltoyota.

"stickguy toyotad:

i like that. didn't think of it, but it sounds like an interesting plan. you'll still suffer lousy depreciation, but at least it's mitigated by the huge upfront discount and the buyout can save you some finance charges, if you use cash. if you don't have cash, then it may be better to let the lease run its course unless you can get a really low interest loan, like 2%. what are top tier open market rates for 36-48 month loans now?"

any evidence it's a widespread problem?
evidence #1: it happened to me, and i don't feel particularly lucky or unlucky, i generally assume what happens to me is what happens in general. i'm usually right.

evidence #2: the whole finance lease return rules, regulations, and contract (as written by kia finance) is fatally flawed, incompetently flawed, and rigged to benefit them, with no recourse for the customer to challenge inaccuracies short of a csi tracking system.

evidence #3: dealership toyotad they didn't lose a key fob in 7 years. makes it odd they'd burn a customer over $350 if it only happens once every 7 years, seems like a small price to pay that wouldn't dent their bottom line. what's more likely? that it happens weekly, and $350/week would put a dent in their bottom line, and therefore that's why they don't want to pay it.

evidence #4: kia finance's whole system of billing and collecting on faulty charges reeks odor. they've done this before. they seem confident they are correct.

bottom line is i find their ""evidence"" no more credible than mine, and i knows whos is right and correct."
"i did the math on this example:

https://www.kiaofcherryhill.com/search/new-kia-stinger-cherry-hill-nj/?s:pr=0&cy=08002&md=7494&mk=30&tp=new

54k msrp. i'm thinking you get this below invoice (50,726) so let's say selling price is $49500.

the payment here in nj with tax and only first payment oop is $670. acq fee is $595, 450 doc, 400 reg

i like the stinger a lot, but for nearly $700 i'd be forced to look at other options if i was set on leasing."

that's what i'm considering doing with the 2019 gts i found it's just crazy.

it makes sense and is easy enough to do.

i did it on a volkswagen a while back. and a friend of my wife's wanted a kona last year - the incentives were significant but specific to a lease, so i helped her get the lease done and then she bought it out within a month or two.

lease incentives on my v90 xc were similar to the stinger deal, to the point i got nearly $20k off msrp. as with the kia, the money factor equates to an interest rate around 5%, so i've considered buying out the lease to reduce the interest expense. i may still do it, but with average rates around 3.5%, it doesn't actually save a lot of money, and i lose the risk reduction with being under a lease."

ha! funny, my calculation is the following:

i think they might win the argument in court that my beef is with the dealership, not with kia finance (though nothing is guaranteed).

my calculation is i'm not suing anyone for less than 4 figures, and $350 falls below my threshold to take the dealership to small claims court.

my calculation is that kia finance nor their collectors will sue me for less than 4 figures either, and $350 will fall below their threshold.

we will just all agree to hate each other, and there will be no suing. if there is suing, i'll sue. let the games begin, but i'll let them throw the first punch."
